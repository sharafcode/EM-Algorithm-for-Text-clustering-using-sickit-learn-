197,training-dataset/business/514.txt,business,The 2016 ElectionI am endorsing Hillary Clinton for president  I ve never endorsed a presidential candidate before  but I m making an exception this year  because this election is exceptional  Donald Trump represents an unprecedented threat to America  and voting for Hillary is the best way to defend our country against it   A Trump presidency would be a disaster for the American economy  He has no real plan to restore economic growth   His racist  isolationist policies would divide our country  and American innovation would suffer  But the man himself is even more dangerous than his policies  He s erratic  abusive  and prone to fits of rage   He represents a real threat to the safety of women  minorities  and immigrants  and I believe this reason alone more than disqualifies him to be president  My godson s father  who is Mexican by birth and fears being deported or worse  is who convinced me to spend a significant amount of time working on this election at the beginning of this year  when Trump still seemed like an unlikely possibility   Trump shows little respect for the Constitution  the Republic  or for human decency  and I fear for national security if he becomes our president   The only two vocal Trump supporters I am close to are Peter Thiel and my grandma  Peter is a part time partner at YC  meaning he spends a small fraction of his time advising YC companies  does not have a vote in how YC is run  and in his case waives the equity part time partners normally get   This has been a strain on my relationship with both of them I think they are completely wrong in their support of this man  Though I don t ascribe all positions of a politician to his or her supporters  I do not understand how one continues to support someone who brags about sexual assault  calls for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the US  or any number or other disqualifying statements  I will continue to try to change both of their minds   Some have said that YC should terminate its relationship with Peter over this  But as repugnant as Trump is to many of us  we are not going to fire someone over his or her support of a political candidate  As far as we know  that would be unprecedented for supporting a major party nominee  and a dangerous path to start down  of course  if Peter said some of the things Trump says himself  he would no longer be part of Y Combinator    The way we got into a situation with Trump as a major party nominee in the first place was by not talking to people who are very different than we are  The polarization of the country into two parallel political realities is not good for any of us  We should listen to each other more  not less   We should all feel a duty to try to understand the roughly half of the country that thinks we are severely misguided  I don t understand how 43  of the country supports Trump  But I d like to find out  because we have to include everyone in our path forward  If our best ideas are to stop talking to or fire anyone who disagrees with us  we ll be facing this whole situation again in 2020   That kind of diversity is painful and unpopular  but it is critical to health of a democratic and pluralistic society  We shouldn t start purging people for supporting the wrong political candidate  That s not how things are done in this country,"[197 267 495 718 1081 983 894 828 748 1237 216]"

267,training-dataset/business/746.txt,business,What I Heard From Trump SupportersAfter the election  I decided to talk to 100 Trump voters from around the country  I went to the middle of the country  the middle of the state  and talked to many online   This was a surprisingly interesting and helpful experience I highly recommend it  With three exceptions  I found something to like about everyone I talked to  though I strongly disagreed with many of the things they said   Although it shouldn t have surprised me given the voting data  I was definitely surprised by the diversity of the people I spoke to I did not expect to talk to so many Muslims  Mexicans  Black people  and women in the course of this project   Almost everyone I asked was willing to talk to me  but almost none of them wanted me to use their names even people from very red states were worried about getting  targeted by those people in Silicon Valley if they knew I voted for him   One person in Silicon Valley even asked me to sign a confidentiality agreement before she would talk to me  as she worried she d lose her job if people at her company knew she was a strong Trump supporter   I wanted to understand what Trump voters liked and didn t like about the president  what they were nervous about  what they thought about the left s response so far  and most importantly  what would convince them not to vote for him in the future   Obviously  this is not a poll  and not  data   But I think narratives are really important   Here s what I heard   The TL DR quote is this    You all can defeat Trump next time  but not if you keep mocking us  refusing to listen to us  and cutting us out  It s Republicans  not Democrats  who will take Trump down    What do you like about Trump    He is not politically correct   Note  This sentiment came up a lot  probably in at least a third of the conversations I had    He says true but unpopular things  If you can t talk about problems  you can t fix them     I m a Jewish libertarian who s  sic  grandparents were Holocaust survivors  Over the last few years the mainstream left has resorted to name calling and character assassination  instead of debate  any time their positions are questioned  This atmosphere became extremely oppressive and threatening to people  like myself  who disagreed with many of Obama s policies over the past several years  Intelligent debate has become rare     It s a lot like political discussion was in Soviet Union  actually  I think the inability to acknowledge obvious truths  and the ever increasing scope of these restrictions makes it particularly frustrating  And personally  for whatever reason  I find inability to have more subtle discussion very frustrating  things are not white or black  but you can t talk about greys since the politically correct answer is white     He is anti abortion   Note  This sentiment came up a lot  A number of people I spoke to said they didn t care about anything else he did and would always vote for whichever candidate was more anti abortion    I like that he puts the interests of Americans first  American policy needs to be made from a position of how Americans benefit from it  as that is the role of government     He is anti immigration   Note  This sentiment came up a lot  The most surprising takeaway for me how little it seemed to be driven by economic concerns  and how much it was driven by fears about  losing our culture    safety    community   and a general Us vs  Them mentality    He will preserve our culture  Preservation of culture is considered good in most cases  What s wrong with preserving the good parts of American culture     He s not Hillary Clinton     I m Mexican  I support the wall  The people who have stayed have destroyed Mexico  and now they want to get out and cause damage here  We need to protect our borders  but now any policy is like that is called racist  Trump was the first person willing to say that out loud     I am socially very liberal  I am fiscally very conservative  I don t feel I have a party  never have  I grew up in a more socially conservative time and picked the  lesser of two evils  during elections  Now  the more socially liberal side supports bigger governments  more aid and support and that money has to come from somewhere  I see what s deducted from my check each week  I m OK with never being rich but I d like more security and that doesn t come from more government spending     We need borders at every level of our society     I m willing to postpone some further social justice progress  which doesn t really result in loss of life  in favor of less foreign policy involvement  the opposite of which does     Brown people are always the out crowd  I think subconsciously  part of the reason I supported him was a way to be in the in crowd for once    What don t you like about him    The way he talks about women is despicable     Everything about his style  We only voted for him because this election was too important to worry about style     I don t like most things about him  The way it worked is we got to choose one of two terrible options     I think our nation needs Trumpism to survive long term  and to me that supersedes almost every other reservation I have  My issue is with Trump himself  I think he s the wrong vessel for his movement  but he s all we ve got so I m behind him     I think the rollout of the immigration executive order is emblematic of a clusterfuck  to be completely frank     I now believe the Muslim ban actually makes us less safe     Isolationism and protectionism at this point is insane  We ve done that before     I  too  worry about the dishonesty  His relationship with Russia  his relationship with women  His relationship with questionable financial matters  These all worry me and were they to continue I would lose all respect     He continually plays into a character that he has created to rile his fan base  Accepting anti semitism  white nationalism  or hate emanating unnecessarily  creates a vacuum of fear on social media  on television  and around the dinner table  Even though the policies may be similar to that of any recent Republican President  the behavior to act so immaturely sets a bad example for children and undercuts many cultural norms  which more than anything causes disruption to our sociological foundations     I hate that he discredits the press all the time  That seems to forebode great evil    What are you nervous about with Trump as president    The thing I m most worried about is war  and that he could destroy the whole world  I think I may have underestimated that risk  because he is more of an alpha strongman that I realized when I voted for him  Otherwise I still like him   Note  Most people weren t that worried about war  More frequent comments were along these lines    I know he s taking strong positions on certain foreign issues  but I feel in negotiations you need to do things to move the needle and when a whole country is watching its hard to keep a poker face  but at least his business track record overall gives us reason to believe ultimately stability will prevail    and   He s crazy  but it s a tactic to get other nations not to mess with us     I worry he will drive us apart as a nation  I believed him when he said that would stop with the campaign  but I haven t seen signs of it so far     I am nervous that his mental health is actually bad     I worry he is actually going to roll back social change we ve fought so hard for  But I hope not        What do you think about the left s response so far    You need to give us an opportunity to admit we may have been wrong without saying we re bad people  I am already thinking I made a mistake  but I feel ostracized from my community     The left is more intolerant than the right   Note  This concept came up a lot  with real animosity in otherwise pleasant conversations    Stop calling us racists  Stop calling us idiots  We aren t  Listen to us when we try to tell you why we aren t  Oh  and stop making fun of us     I d love to see one tenth of the outrage about the state of our lives out here that you have for Muslims from another country  You have no idea what our lives are like     I m so tired of hearing about white privilege  I m white  but way less privileged than a black person from your world  I have no hope my life will ever get any better     I am tired of feeling silenced and demonized  We have mostly the same goals  and different opinions about how to get there  Maybe I m wrong  maybe you re wrong  But enough with calling all of us the devil for wanting to try Trump  I hate Hillary and think she wants to destroy the country of us but I don t demonize her supporters     I m angry that they re so outraged now  but were never outraged over an existing terrible system     The attacks against Trump have taught me something about myself  I have defended him and said things I really didn t believe or support because I was put in a defensive position  Protesters may have pushed many people in this direction BUT it is ultimately our responsibility and must stop     I d like to also add that the demonization of Trump by calling him and his supporters  Nazis  KKK  white supremacists  fascists  etc  works very well in entrenching Trump supporters on his side  These attacks are counter factual and in my opinion very helpful to Trump     So far his election has driven our nation apart  So far I see most of the divisiveness coming from the left  Shame on them  I don t see it quite as bad as during Nixon s era but we are truly headed in that direction  I could not speak with my parents during that time because political division would intrude  This Thanksgiving and holiday season were as close as I ve felt to that in 40 years  We are increasingly polarized  It doesn t seem to be strictly generational  though that exists  There is an east coast west coast  rural vs  urban  racial  and gender division forming now  It has the potential to be devastating     The amount of violent attacks and economic attacks perpetrated by the left are troublesome  My wife and I recently moved to the Bay Area  I was expecting a place which was a welcoming meritocracy of ideas  Instead  I found a place where everyone constantly watches everyone else for any thoughtcrime     Silicon Valley is incredibly unwelcoming to alternative points of view  Your curiosity  if it is sincere  is the very rare exception to the rule     There is something hypocritical about the left saying the are uniters not dividers  they are inclusive and then excluding half the population with comments on intelligence and irrelevance in the modern world    What would convince you not to vote for him again    War would be unforgivable     If the Russia thing were true  I d turn against him  Why don t y all focus on that instead of his tweets     Give us a better option  and we ll be happy  But it needs to be a moderate Sanders won t win     I ll happily vote for someone else  There s a lot I hate about Trump  But our lives are basically destroyed  and he was the first person to talk about fixing that     Generally hard to say  Extreme corruption would do it    Second person in the same conversation   I don t care if he s corrupt  Y all voted for Hillary and she was the most corrupt candidate of all time     Another worry is an escalation of overreaches between him and the left that culminates in the breakdown of our system of law  I d hold him responsible for that     If he were to get the US involved in a major military conflict  I think the odds of this have actually decreased versus Hillary  but I m willing to be proven wrong   If he were to substantially increase the cost of doing business  by increasing regulation or taxes for instance      I m socially very liberal  If he were to do something like restart a war on drugs  try to restrict rights of LGBT  or make first trimester abortions difficult or dangerous  I d rethink my position  I think these type of things are extremely unlikely though  especially with an election a few years away the country as a whole becoming more socially liberal     I think if 2008 happened again  further into Trump s tenure  so that causation can be shown  hypothetically   the base would evaporate     Based on Trump s history before politics I don t believe he is racist  sexist  homophobic or bigoted  If that were true it would supersede everything else since it would be even worse for individual liberty and freedom than any freedom of speech restrictions or increases in government size proposed by the Democratic Party,"[267 197 495 718 1081 894 983 1111 828 748 1237]"
495,training-dataset/business/178.txt,business,Sam AltmanI m going to say something very unpopular in my world  Trump is right about some big things   He s right that many Americans are getting screwed by the system  He s right that the economy is not growing nearly fast enough  He s right that we re drowning in political correctness  and that broken campaign finance laws have bred a class of ineffective career politicians  He may even be right that free trade is not the best policy  Trump supporters are not dumb   But Trump is wrong about the more important part  how to fix these problems  Many of his proposals  such as they are  are so wrong they re difficult to even respond to   Even more dangerous  though  is the way he s wrong  He is not merely irresponsible  He is irresponsible in the way dictators are   Trump s casual racism  misogyny  and conspiracy theories are without precedent among major presidential nominees  He has said that a judge of Mexican descent isn t treating him fairly because of his heritage and that we should ban Muslims from entering the country   When his supporters beat up a homeless Hispanic man and cited Trump  he called them  very passionate   He has accused Obama of somehow being responsible for the recent shooting in Orlando   To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s  it s chilling to watch Trump in action  Though I know intellectually it s easy in hard economic times to rile people up with a hatred of outsiders  it s still surprising to watch this happen right in front of us   It s hard to tell  as it often is with demagogues  how much is calculation and how much is genuine belief  But it s a real and terrifying possibility that Trump actually believes much of what he says  In any case  when he says it  it signals to other people that it s ok to believe   Demagogic hate mongers lead down terrible paths  It would be particularly embarrassing for us to fall for this we are a nation of immigrants  and we know that immigrants built this country  and Trump  of course  is the grandson of immigrants and married to an immigrant    Hitler taught us about the Big Lie the lie so big  and so often repeated  that people end up believing it   Trump s Big Lie is hiding in plain sight  His Big Lie is that he s going to Make America Great by keeping us safe from outsiders   But he has no serious plan for how to restore economic growth  which is what we actually need  Without it  we ll be in a zero sum game and face continued infighting  And without it  we ll lose our position as the most powerful country in the world   He distracts us with hate of outsiders in the hopes that we don t notice he has no plan for the inside  He has failed to put forward a serious plan for major investments in research and technology that we so desperately need  Instead  he tries to distract us with fear of Them   At least Trump is willing to talk about the fact that the US is not on an acceptable growth trajectory  The Big Truth in Trump s slogan is  Again  we do need a fundamental change to get back to where we were  Clinton s dangerously bad Big Lie is that there s no big problem here at all   Trump is right about the problem  but horribly wrong about the solution   I take some risk by writing this  even though I ve supported some Republicans in the past   and I ll feel bad if I end up hurting Y Combinator by doing so  I understand why other people in the technology industry aren t saying much  In an ordinary election it s reasonable for people in the business world to remain publicly neutral  But this is not an ordinary election   In the words of Edmund Burke   The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing   This would be a good time for us all even Republicans  especially Republican politicians who previously endorsed Trump to start speaking up       Note  Anyone is welcome to republish this     Note 2  Apparently the Burke quote was not definitively said by him,"[495 267 197 718 983 1081 894 1111 1237 748 828]"
718,training-dataset/product/894.txt,product,Is UX the new handsome Editor s note  The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not reflect the view of InVision   On September 26th  1960  John F  Kennedy and Richard Nixon stepped on stage for the first ever Presidential debate to be broadcast on national TV   By 1960  88  of American households had TVs  with only a small number of Americans still relying on radio as their main channel of communication  That night it was estimated that some 74 million people tuned in to watch the now historic debate    What happened after the 2 candidates took the stage is a familiar tale  Nixon  pale and underweight from a recent hospitalization  appeared sickly and sweaty  while Kennedy appeared calm and confident  As the story goes  those who listened to the debate on the radio thought Nixon had won  Those that watched the debate on TV thought Kennedy was the clear winner  Many say Kennedy won the election that night    via Time  How the Nixon Kennedy debate changed the world  As history is told  Kennedy won the election that night because of how young  healthy  and handsome he appeared on screen next to Nixon   Campaigning today  Nowadays candidates have so much more to worry about   Not only do they have to worry about their image on screen  now up to 4K resolution   they also have to think about how they represent themselves on social media  how they connect with voters through campaign based applications  and how their person is generally assimilated into technology   And they re expected to do all of this on top of figuring out how to keep citizen journalists like myself at bay so they don t destroy the campaign s hard work with the freedom of press that comes with the internet   Could UX be the new handsome   What is the campaign experience   The campaign experience used to be candidates speaking to the public in person  on the radio  and  since the Kennedy Nixon debate  on TV  But in between appearances they had a chance to relax   Today  candidates have to be connected every second of the day  There is no time off   Hillary has nearly 6 million likes on Facebook  9 million followers on Twitter  and just over 2 million followers on Instagram  Donald has over 10 million on Facebook  11 million on Twitter  and 2 million on Instagram   If today s candidates are not putting the media out there  you d better believe someone will do it for them whether they like it or not   That s a lot of risk to manage   The Hillary Clinton experience  Hillary s campaign is pretty tech savvy this year  But while her campaign is very connected  the connections aren t always meaningful   Hillary s site is beautiful  It has a modern look and feel  the interactions are fairly minimalistic  and it s built to be responsive  The only downfalls come in the form of forced interactions and interactions built to make the site feel trendy   The good  Hillary s site has a ton of amazing things going on for it  For one  it s organized in a way that doesn t take much effort to understand  The text is chunky and easy to read  The visuals match the content it represents  There s a filter for everything you could possibly need  And there are videos for almost everything on the site if you don t feel like reading   There are so many things I could list off that I enjoy about Hillary s site  but here are a few things I specifically love   1  It s built to tell a story  If you actually read through the content on Hillary s site  her team has built the site to tell a story  The content strategy is incredible   Most pages intro with a big  bold headline  a quick statement to summarize the page at a very high level  and an image to assist with understanding  The text is black on a white background  instead of on top of a photo  which makes reading incredibly accessible   It then will give you a big  bold quote to summarize her position and  typically  a video to watch in case you don t feel like reading   After a strong intro  you get into the meat of the page  which is put into listicle form to make it quick and easy to read   I m sure her critics will tell you she s trying to hide the truth by making everything into short lists  but that s not true   What s really happening is that her team is trying to give people the information they need in a digestible manner and then they supply the audience with links to dive deeper if they want more   If you follow these links into The Briefing  you ll dive into an incredibly comprehensive overview of Hillary s plans and how she ll get things done   The reason this isn t all up front is because most people just want enough information to be informed  The content within The Briefing is much more than most people would ever care to read and would more than likely cause them to leave the site because it s so overwhelming   It definitely takes some digging to discover  but that s brilliant content strategy by Team Hillary   2  It s built with mobile first best practices  This sounds like a duh  but you d be shocked how many sites are still lacking mobile responsive best practices   The main navigation is minimal and what s most important is out in the open  not hidden behind a hamburger menu  Everything else you could need  but that isn t quite as important  is tucked away to reduce the cognitive load   On top of that  the content is digestible  contextual navigation is located at the bottom to make it easier for people using their thumbs  notice the filters at the bottom at the end of the GIF   and load speeds are lightning fast   This is incredibly important considering the audience Hillary is trying to reach modern  tech savvy young people who hope for a better future and are probably trying to learn about each candidate from their phones   3  It s built to empower voters  While most sites give you all the information you would ever need to learn  most of them don t do it in a meaningful way   Hillary wants to make education more affordable and reduce student debt  But how s she going to do it   Well  her team could write about her policies and hope you re good at math legal practices  or her team could make a tool that does all that work for you so you can actually understand  And that s exactly what they did   Her team built a calculator to give us a simple output regarding how Hillary s policies will affect us  The simplicity makes her policies transparent and accessible  which is something most political campaigns lack   Try the calculator for yourself here   The bad  As much as I love the site  there are a handful of things I really hate   1  The welcome mat  When you first land on Hillary s page you have to agree to some statement that gets forced upon you  Users can close it out  but that just proves it didn t need to be there in the first place   This content should be embedded somewhere in the site or completely removed  This only benefits Hillary and her campaign team  who get data on what statements people agree with  Her team is not benefitting their audience by doing this   Sure  it probably is meant to cause some psychological priming  but blocking users from getting to where they want to be is not the way to do it   2  Meaningless interactions  I also have a beef with the interactions on this page comparing Hillary and Trump s economic plans   What is the purpose in hiding information behind a sliding door  To show off your tech team s talent  To create a big aha moment  I don t get it   These types of interactions lead to a loss of content consumption because people don t know how to interact with it  And if someone can t figure out how to do what they want in less than a second or 2  they ll just move on without reading the content you spent hours building   Just because you can do something on the web doesn t mean you should   Other touch points  Hillary also has a text messaging alert service and a mobile application  If I had to remove anything from this campaign  it would be the mobile app   Hillary s app seems to be more about entertainment than anything  It s clearly an attempt to gamify the election process  but it s not really adding much value to her campaign   The good  There wasn t a lot I liked about the app  but there is one little thing I noticed that I think is brilliant  The limited time only challenges   In general  the app lacks a lot but this is one part that they nailed   The bad  The onboarding leaves much to be desired  I understand data helps drive the campaign forward  but it doesn t help the person using the app   First they collect your email  either through manual entry or by connecting your Facebook account   Then they try to sneak in collecting your phone number to say that it ll make it easier for you to pull your friends into the app  But you still don t know why or if you even need your friends   If you want people s data  give them a reason to want to give it to you first   Once you get in  it s basically a swipeable panorama of an illustrated room that is said to be your personal HQ   The only motivation to do any of the challenges is if you want to trick out your HQ otherwise you ll probably only use share the app if you re an incredibly passionate Hillary voter   For an in depth review of her application  check out this detailed review   Hillary s text alert service  The service will send you text alerts about important news and events happening around you that pertain to the Clinton campaign  It s pretty cool that they can tell where you are  I received one pertaining to Nebraska while I was visiting home  and then the rest have been for California  where I live   but overall I m not super enthused by it   The info is helpful  but it would be great if I could text back  Especially considering the frequency at which they ping you  It s usually limited to one per day  but I ve gotten multiples in a day lately   The service is a good idea and has merit  but could be so much better  If I could text her campaign and dig into what I want  that would be a game changer   Unfortunately  this service is one way and built only to allow Hillary s team to contact you when they want   The Donald Trump experience  Trump s campaign is connected  but the connections aren t built to inform they re built to collect data and donations  His campaign also lacks many design best practices   Donald s site is a good reflection of his campaign  It s light on content and built to collect data and donations   The good  I have few good things to say about this experience   1  It drives the audience to register to vote  There are no complaints on this point  In order for Trump to win  people need to vote  And they can t vote unless they re registered to vote   Making registration accessible  and a priority on the site  is a brilliant move  I m really happy to see this and think it s probably one of the best things his site has going on   2  It s lightning quick and mobile responsive  The site is mostly text  It has a page full of videos and there are several images throughout the site  but it s not built with a heavy payload for the browser  This means load times are minimal   The site isn t anything flashy or anything that will win awards  but it is incredibly accessible  You could have an AOL dial up modem and this thing would probably still load fast enough to meet Google s PageSpeed tests   Is this the best approach to grab millennials looking for lots of visual content to quickly scan through and engage with  No  But they aren t Trump s target audience   3  It s built to achieve a goal  The best part about Trump s site is that it s built with purpose  You might not enjoy it from a modern web perspective  but it s doing exactly what the team wants it to do promote Trump  collect campaign donations  and pull your data to keep you in the loop   It s easy to hear feedback from everyone around you and build to meet what everyone wants  But then you end up with a mess that no one wants  You have to respect a team that has a strategy and sticks to it regardless of what people outside of the target audience think or want   The bad  Trump s site is extremely goal driven  The goal  To collect your data and your money   1  Its navigation lacks descriptive language  I really love the  Register to Vote  button  It s a great idea  But the rest is broken  in my opinion   The language of  Positions  versus  Issues  is confusing  Aren t those the same thing   On Trump s site   Positions  will take you to a high level  longform writeup of his plan  The  Issues  link will take you to video snippets of those same plans that you found under  Positions   The weird part is there are actually more videos to watch than positions to read about  but  Issues  is deprioritized   My question  Why aren t they combined  A summary video to complement the longform writeup would make the page much more enjoyable  and it d eliminate having 2 links about  essentially  the same thing   Also  Where is  States  supposed to take you to  Is there a specific message for each state  Shouldn t a candidate s message and platforms be consistent across states   And  Positions  sounds like a section I d go to in order to find a job working for Trump  or at least on his campaign   2  Its navigation deprioritizes the most important links  Why are  Issues    Schedule   and  About  buried in a secondary nav   Based on hierarchy and design indicators  the most important things are that you re registered to vote  you give them your data  and you donate to the campaign    Get Involved  asks for you to sign up for a newsletter   Shop  directs money to the campaign   Contribute  lets you donate  Not far below the masthead you ll see another space to donate  and below that  a CTA to join the text alert system  i e  grab more data    And if you take a look at it on mobile  you ll see that s exactly what they want out of you   Side note  Why isn t the  Register to Vote  at the bottom on mobile  If getting people to register were a priority  the team should put the button right by the user s thumb so that it s so easy to click they could accidentally press it   3  It s built to be read longform  Most people skim and or skip over big  chunky paragraphs  just hitting subheaders and standout bullet points quotes   The text on Trump s site is on the small side for web standards  and it s thin  The content is written in big  chunky paragraphs and there are no subheaders to break up the blocks  There also are no visuals to assist in the story being told  This makes reading difficult   If I wrote this way  it would be so that you didn t want to read what I was writing   I m not sure if this is intentional or just poor design  There s probably a good chance that it s built this way to make you not want to read  But even if it is just poor design by his team  it s definitely a pain point   Side note  I also find it funny that all of the headers on his site are full caps lock  This method gives the reader a sense that they re being yelled at and also makes it harder to read   Other touch points  Trump  like Hillary  also has a mobile app and a text alert system  However  unlike Hillary  I think Trump s team nailed the mobile app at least in terms of meeting his campaign strategy   The America First app is pretty well thought out  It gamifies the political trail and gets people to do the work for Trump by enabling them to do it in a simple and engaging way   The good  Hillary s app is more of a Sims meets Tamagotchi type of gamification  It s built in hopes that passionate supporters will want to build and grow an office  keep digital plants alive  and share with their friends  Trump s is gamified in a way that makes it seem beneficial to you   Trump s is better because it plays to his claim to fame  The Apprentice   Not only can you rise up the ranks by working for Trump for free  you can also see how you compare to the rest of the people using the app   Trump s team nailed this app  It s a brilliant gamification strategy   The bad  The design is generally poor  but it aligns well with his site  It s text heavy  it lacks imagery and hierarchy  and it deprioritizes readability   The readability of the site is only slightly better than Reddit   Another pain point  similar to Hillary  is the onboarding  The difference is that Trump s is even longer   Instead of just collecting your email  Trump wants to collect  name  email  about me  phone number  Zip code  whether you re registered to vote  gender  age range  and full home address  in that order  before you begin   While this is a poor strategy when it comes to user experience  his team is  again  sticking to strategy very well   For a deeper look into Trump s America First app  check out this post from Adweek   Trump s text alert service  From what I ve seen while using it  Trump s text alert system is also built to collect data and donations   I was actually pretty interested to watch this video  thought it might be something exclusive to those who signed up for the text service  Turns out it was another one of Trump s quick   I m the best  you should vote for the best  videos and a CTA to donate money   And then within 3 hours of joining I received 2 new pings from the Trump campaign asking for money again  This time   100 even   I wanted to text  STOP  after the last one but decided to keep going  Since then I ve been getting 2 3 pings from Trump and his team every day  asking for money   What I would do  While sites and apps are scalable  they re also static   Even with the best sites you have to dig and really explore to get anything meaningful out of it  Trust me  I did it all to write this piece   Going to a website or interacting with an app is not the same as if you could communicate with each candidate individually   Imagine if you could scale each candidate and their personality so that every voter had the opportunity to chat with them one on one  All it would take is creating a chatbot with some AI or NLP behind it to enable a conversation   While this probably sounds crazy futuristic  it s not that hard  And these candidates have the money to make it happen   But since they won t  I created a simple version to let you experience what that could be like   Meet The People s Eagle  Is this bot built to replace CNN  Fox News  or any other professional publication  No   Will it break down every detail of every opinion in real time and fact check like NPR or other fact checker sites  No   But will it let you ask what you re curious about and get a short but meaningful answer with articles to dig deeper if you want to  Yes   I made this to make interacting with and participating in the election fun and effortless instead of bureaucratic and cumbersome  The templated experience you get by following the buttons should work well  but just be warned that the chat AI is still infantile   The People s Eagle was created to inspire educated democracy by making learning about and participating in this year s election fun and effortless   Commands you should be aware of    What is  Hillary s or Trump s  plan for  topic       other variations work but along these lines helps   Am I registered   or  How do I register      If you re not registered or not sure  it can help you out   What can you do    Who should I vote for    Why should I vote    Main Menu  or  Help     if you get lost  Check this out      if you have breaking news or information about a topic that needs to be covered    There are also some Easter eggs in there  see if you can find them     Just remember  it s still a baby bot so it won t know everything yet  And it s mostly built to discuss each candidate s platforms  not their scandals or trending buzz  But as you and the rest of the world chat with it  it will learn those things  Not immediately  but it will   Who will win 2016   I m incredibly excited to see how everything turns out on November 8th and to see if the experience each candidate has crafted will make any difference   Who is winning right now  based on their campaign experience  I d have to go with Hillary   Similar to her campaign  her touch points have a couple of pain points related to trying to be more modern than she really is  but  overall  the experience is awesome and you can tell she knows her stuff   Trump s isn t terrible  but a lot of it seems to be about driving revenue to himself  marketing himself  not his platforms or campaign   and entertaining people   Ultimately  the only thing that matters is the final vote count on November 8th  2016  So make sure you get out and vote this November  Only then will we know if any of this makes a difference   Join the conversation  Who do you think has a better digital experience  Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump  Tell us on

or You ll be a Dinosaur in 3 Years  Mark Cuban opened the Upfront Summit in an epic interview by Jason Hirschhorn  founder of Media REDEF   Machine Learning   AI  They discussed many topics ranging from protection of the press to what Mark looks for in an entrepreneur to investing outside of Silicon Valley and of course Trump and sports  But perhaps to most insightful was their discussion about Machine Learning   AI   Mark made a fortune by being early in Local Area Networking  streaming and then High Definition video so perhaps it s worth listening  He said that he believes AI will have a bigger impact than any technology in the last 30 years    Artificial Intelligence  deep learning  machine learning   whatever you re doing if you don t understand it   learn it  Because otherwise you re going to be a dinosaur within 3 years    Mark also said that what happens in the next 5 10 years is just going to blow everybody away  especially in the field of automation  He thinks even programming is vulnerable to being automated and reducing the number of available programming jobs   Startups Outside Silicon Valley  Jason asked Mark is he thought it was possible to build non Silicon Valley successful startups   Mark said that the beauty of Silicon Valley isn t the money available for financing it s the money available for exits  Part of the problem is that companies don t go public any more  If more companies outside Silicon Valley went public that would shift the balance of power  20 years ago there were 9 000 public companies  Now there are 4 000  There s a ton of capital only available for people who go public so people not going public is myopic   And he believes with less companies going public there is less competition  He said if Instagram went public  Or Oculus or twitch went public there would be more competition and he believes that as a country this isn t good for us  If more companies around the country went public it would create more ecosystems because any time there are smart people gathered money will find them and fund them   but there need to be exits   Mark also pointed out that the number of investments he personally makes in San Francisco has dropped by 90    Here is the full YouTube interview   Great Entrepreneurs  Jason  What do you look for when you re looking at an entrepreneur   Mark  smart  continuous learning  90  of Mark s reading now is about neural networks  machine learning   that s where everything is going   put in the time to execute  willing to sell  care about making a profit   at some point you have to make money  All of the investments he s making are related to the artificial intelligence world   Greatest Public Startups  Jason  You are still an investor in Netflix  right   Mark  My two biggest holdings are Netflix and Amazon  They are the two best startups in the industry with Google and Facebook being good companies behind them   Protecting Freedom of the Press  Jason  The documentary at the Sundance film festival about Gawker  Nobody Speak  convinced me that although I didn t like Gawker this really was a 1st amendment issue and it scares me about protecting the Fourth Estate  an independent press   How are we going to protect the Fourth Estate   Mark  The media industry needs to just do what it does  Four years will go fast  But NY Times  WaPo   CNN can t get caught up in just trying to make Trump or make Trump followers happy   Politics   Jason  Do you meet with the President if he calls   Mark  Look  when you sit down with Trump or speak 1 1 on the phone  he s personable  He s nice  And you think  ok  this guys alright  And then for whatever reason when you walk out the room he s Dr  Jekyll  Mr  Hyde   We all fall into the same trap  we roll our eyes at what he says and then think we re going to use logic to convince his supporters to change their minds   it doesn t work    Suster side note   read this powerful book The Righteous Mind if you want to understand why logic doesn t work to persuade voters   most important post election book I ve read    Mark  23  of eligible voters voted for Trump  25  of eligible voters voted against him  52  didn t vote  We   and the media   should only focus on the undecided  Only 9  of American adults get news from Twitter so we aren t getting the news from his Tweets  we re getting news from how the media covers his Tweets    Trump isn t going to change  But what s critically important is how we respond  Demonstrations  yes  but they have to be peaceful  They have to be civil    But it is hard to be patient when he s such an idiot  And we have a president that s never sent an email in his life   Combatting Online Trolls  Dick Costolo thought during his tenure he didn t do enough to combat trolls  You have mentioned you have an idea how to combat things  What is it   Mark  If I Tweet and somebody responds to my Tweet and trolls me   I should have the ability to kick them out of the thread  Trollers don t troll because they want to say something  they troll because they want somebody to notice them  I d like to exclude them from this thread or permanently  Or I should be able to Tweet and say that nobody can comment on this Tweet  Or I should be able to reply but have my reply be private  In fact  we re building an app to do just this   Sports  A final 5  minutes talked about sports  Mostly about how the NFL is a problem sport due to concussions and injuries  But if you re a sports or Cuban fan you ll want to listen to this bit  too   Suster Sidenote  There were many famous speakers and attendees at the Upfront Summit but I was given a very strict assignment by my two boys  11   13    the only thing they cared about was that I got a photo with Mark Cuban  They are huge fans of Shark Tank  Often my sons are in the car when I m talking with entrepreneurs or my partners about deals  After years of watching Shark Tank it s heartening to hear them make comments like   I don t know why he gave up so much equity  Why didn t he just do a licensing deal   Ha  Gotta love great role models  So here ya go  boys,"[894 267 718 1111 495 983 1237 828 748 1081 197]"
983,training-dataset/business/1397.txt,business,Time to Take a StandIt is time for tech companies to start speaking up about some of the actions taken by President Trump s administration   There are many actions from his first week that are objectionable  In repeatedly invoking unsubstantiated conspiracy theories  like the 3 million illegal votes   he s delegitimizing his opponents and continuing to damage our society  So much objectionable action makes it hard to know where and when to focus  and outrage fatigue is an effective strategy   But the executive order from yesterday titled  Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States  is tantamount to a Muslim ban and requires objection  I am obviously in favor of safety and rules  but broad strokes actions targeted at a specific religious group is the wrong solution  and a first step toward a further reduction in rights   In addition  the precedent of invalidating already issued visas and green cards should be extremely troubling for immigrants of any country or for anyone who thinks their contributions to the US are important  This is not just a Muslim ban  This is a breach of America s contract with all the immigrants in the nation   This administration has already shown that they are not particularly impressed by the first amendment  and that they are interested in other anti immigrant action  So we must object  or our inaction will send a message that the administration can continue to take away our rights   In doing so  we should not demonize Trump voters most of them voted for him for reasons other than the promise of a Muslim ban  We need their eventual support in resisting actions like these  and we will not get it if we further isolate them   The tech community is powerful  Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard  We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally  Although there is some business risk in doing so  there is strength in numbers if everyone does it early this coming week  we will all make each other stronger   Tech companies go to extraordinary lengths to recruit and retain employees  those employees have a lot of leverage  If employees push companies to do something  I believe they ll have to   At a minimum  companies should take a public stance  But talking is only somewhat effective  and employees should push their companies to figure out what actions they can take  I wish I had better ideas here  but we re going to have a meeting on Friday at Y Combinator to discuss  I d love to see other tech companies do the same   If this action has not crossed a line for you  I suggest you think now about what your own line in the sand is  It s easy  with gradual escalation  for the definition of  acceptable  to get moved  So think now about what action President Trump might take that you would consider crossing a line  and write it down   Almost every member of the GOP I have spoken to knows that these actions are wrong  Paul Ryan  Mike Pence  Kevin McCarthy and James Mattis said so themselves when Trump first proposed his Muslim ban  We need to remind anyone involved in this administration that  for the rest of their lives  they will have to explain why they were complicit in this   In my first post on Trump last June  I said it would be a good time for all of us to start speaking up  We are now at the stage where something is starting that is going to be taught in history classes  and not in a good way  This morning  Kellyanne Conway posted on Twitter that Trump is  a man of action  who is  just getting started   I believe her  We must now start speaking up,"[983 495 267 197 894 1111 718 216 1081 828 748]"
1081,training-dataset/product/513.txt,product,What Product Managers Can Learn From PoliticsBrexit  Hillary  Trump  Cruz  Bernie  Benghazi  Have you noticed that lately politics has become such a dominant focus across our culture that political figures and events have earned the single name designation once enjoyed only by celebrities  Indeed  would you have ever guessed that you could overhear a conversation at a dinner party about a public figure whom both people referred to only as  Cruz    and not assume they were talking about Tom Cruise  or at least Pen lope Cruz    Now  unless you re a political junkie  you re probably starting to tire of the nonstop discussions  debates  news headlines  TV segments  and radio conversations dedicated to national and international politics  It probably seems as though no matter which news sources you consume   or even which entertainment outlets you tune into or which dinner parties you attend   you just can t escape today s endless yakking about politics   But that might not be such a bad thing  In fact  as a product manager you can actually learn some valuable lessons from observing politics  Politicians and political campaigns have  after all  a lot of similarities to product management  They package themselves as products and attempt to sell what they re offering to customers  They jostle and battle constantly with competitors  they use surveys and other intelligence gathering strategies to learn what their constituencies want  and they often redefine themselves when the market calls for it  Plus  they are always working towards a  release date    usually an election or re election in the case of politicians  or  in the specific case of Brexit  an actual release   So let s examine politics from a new angle   as a source of insight and learning for product managers  You might discover a couple of useful nuggets for your job in the political truisms below  Besides  today politics is everywhere anyway  so we might as well get some value from it   Disclaimer  Before we begin  it s important to point out that this is not a political post  We will use current examples of political figures and events to find new ideas for product management  But we won t express a political opinion about any of them   And nope  You won t be able to tell where we stand by reading between the lines   We at ProductPlan are here to make the best product roadmap software  not political commentary   No matter where you stand on all of this  we hope that when you put your product manager hat on  you can make use of some of the lessons below   even from the guy wearing the  Make Donald Trump Again  hat   4 Lessons Product Managers Can Learn from Politics  1  Keep your focus strategic and high level  stay out of the weeds   Yes  Hillary has almost certainly won the Democratic nomination by now  But that s not the only story of the Democratic Party s 2016 primary  Hillary Clinton   a single name designee in politics for decades  and by far the most famous female presidential candidate in history   faced a real challenge right up until the final primaries from an obscure Vermont senator nobody had ever heard of until a few months earlier   So how did he do it  How did Bernie Sanders   now just  Bernie  to us all   mount such an impressive challenge to the most presumptive of presumptive nominees ever   Here s where we find a great lesson for product managers as well as political campaign managers  Love him  hate him  or really hate him  Bernie stayed strategic  spoke of high level  visionary ideas  and always stayed on message  Hillary  on the other hand  spoke as a true technocrat  Her zillion point plan for improving America included endless details of marginal tax rates and updates to trade agreements and using government to craft an economic environment in which  something or other  And as for a consistent message  Hillary famously had four or five  campaign launches   as her staff kept trying to figure out how to best sell her to voters   Bernie built a following and packed theaters and auditoriums with an energy that we typically see only from rock stars  And that s largely because he presented incredibly clear ideas centered on an equally clear vision  standing up to Wall Street  reducing poverty  making college affordable  etc   Any product that hopes to compete  let alone win with customers  needs to be equally clear and visionary in its approach and execution  If your users can understand what your product does and how it solves their problem with little or no explanation   and  just as important  if they can easily communicate that vision to friends and colleagues   you might have a winner  But if it takes spreadsheets  diagrams and long conversations to fully grasp what your product does  you have more strategy work to do   2  Go beyond surveys  Identify a problem and find product market fit   For this lesson we ll use Trump  Love him  hate him  or really hate him  Trump violated almost every major political rule ever articulated by a campaign manager  Washington pundit or other expert  And he won his party s primary   Of all of the rules he broke  perhaps the most important  the one that played the greatest role in his success  was Trump s refusal to ask permission  to listen to what that day s polls said  to change his message for different audiences  and to  soften  when everyone told him to do so   That s what politicians do  They poll likely voters  They hold focus groups to test which words and phrases will resonate with their constituents  Indeed  politicians running for office seem to be constantly asking for the opinions and permission of other people  This approach might make for a more polished candidate  one who does and says what we d all expect  but it rarely excites anyone   Similarly  with your products  it s easy to fall into the trap of only soliciting advice from your user and buyer personas  surveying prospects  reading industry analyst reports   and using all of this data to develop products you think people will want  And who knows  That might work   But as a product manager  you are a leader  You should also know your personas  your market and the problem that your product solves so well that you ll be in a better position than even your own customers to know what should comprise your next release   Trump identified issues in the United States that he believed in strongly  He developed a product  read  campaign  and found incredible product market fit with voters who are frustrated with the Republican establishment  He went beyond polls and the surveys to truly understand voters   pain points   and then he addressed them   3  Your product must have emotional as well as logical appeal   Brexit  The name itself offers an emotionally satisfying feeling   conveying in just two syllables that Britain could actually free itself from the international organization some of its citizens have long believed was keeping the country from being an independent nation   Of course  the rank and file members of the  Remain  camp  those who wanted to keep the United Kingdom in the European Union  had equally strong feelings about their position  But that campaign s de facto leader  Prime Minister David Cameron  underestimated the value of using an emotional appeal in his pitch to the British people   Instead  Cameron made his case for keeping the UK in the EU almost entirely on logical grounds  He warned about the difficulties of disentangling the bureaucratic ties between the nation and EU s leadership in Brussels  He warned about the economic hit Britain might suffer by losing their favored trade status as an EU member and having to create complex new agreements with international trading partners  And on and on   The Brexit or  Leave  camp s approach  on the other hand  was primarily emotional  They spoke of Britain reclaiming its status as a leader among nations  yay    about freeing themselves from the thousands of petty EU regulations they were suffering under  ick    and about regaining the ability to control their own destiny  hear  hear     The result  The  Leave  camp won by a small margin  Brexit made it into the international vocabulary  And as for the logic focused leader of the  Remain  camp  He was forced to resign as prime minister  Don t discount the major role that emotion plays in buying decisions  Sometimes it can be the dominant factor   even if your customers themselves don t realize it  With that in mind  it s a great idea to prioritize themes and features  even small ones  that will surprise and delight your customers  Logic is great  but emotion sells   4  Don t compromise your product for a short term win   Let s return one more time to Trump  Among the hard and fast rules of politics that he broke was speaking in a  non presidential  way  as many of his critics put it  Trump called Senator Cruz  Lyin  Ted   He called Senator Rubio  Little Marco   And he called former Florida Governor Jeb Bush  Low Energy Jeb    Whatever your feelings are about Trump  you have to admit the man was being himself  That got so much attention precisely because it was something voters aren t used to experiencing in a political candidate  And whether it was working or not  it seemed  Trump was going to continue unapologetically delivering his product   Now  let s contrast that with the other Republican candidates vying for the nomination  As they saw the Trump Train gaining momentum  and their own poll numbers and delegate counts suffering  several of these politicians compromised their integrity in a desperate attempt to keep their candidacies alive a little longer   Senators Rubio and Cruz  for example  both resorted to responding to Trump s non presidential behavior by behaving similarly themselves  Cruz referred to Trump as  utterly amoral  and a  pathological liar   In response to Trump s  Little Marco  references  Senator Rubio answered with an off color joke about the size of Trump s hands   In other words  these candidates compromised their larger message and everything they had built their candidacies on for the sake of grabbing a few more votes  Without blunt  polarizing figures such as Trump in the race  is it conceivable either of these men would have resorted to such nasty personal attacks on another candidate  Not likely   And what s important to understand here is that these tactics didn t work  Both the Cruz and Rubio campaigns suffered serious

compromise your product for a short term win  Don t radically alter your product s priorities or message or key elements just to please an aggressive but unreasonable constituent  or to hit a

BuzzFeed  It conjures up a range of emotions anytime I ve privately expressed my opinion to thought leaders in our industry that I believe it is one of the most innovative companies in digital media  Some  of course  agree with me that BuzzFeed has been and continues to be the gold standard innovator in digital media to emulate   Others are skeptical   Ha  It s a lightweight website of listicles that is grossly over valued  some have argued  Others have said   Sure  they grow so fast because they buy all their traffic    Or perhaps you think Donald Trump s assessment that BuzzFeed is a  Failing pile of garbage  is correct   there s a great story from Jonah in the video but you have to watch to hear it      But it s undeniable that it has become a digital media powerhouse having raised around  500 million in capital with a valuation reported at  1 7 billion and revenues likely exceeding  250 million  Wikipedia lists 2015 revenue at  167 million    If you ask me  I think it s one of the companies that has led and will continue to lead the transformation of media from a lethargic print based  newspapers  magazines  and linear based  TV  format into the most successful digital media brand of the next decade  That is why I invited the Founder   CEO  Jonah Peretti  to come talk at the 2017 Upfront Summit and make the case himself  I have been so fascinated by the emotions that BuzzFeed arouses that I asked Jonah if I could do the interview myself  The 30 minute interview of Jonah Peretti is here but my summary in the notes below   I moved to Los Angeles in 2007 and as a VC who had built his career as a programmer  database designer  program manager  CEO then VP Products at Salesforce  I wanted to build a portfolio of software investments  But I knew I had to look for investments in  software meets X  often known as Vertical Software solutions   rather than necessarily horizontal enterprise software applications  An obvious vector for me would be software for the media industry   I began asking around who the smartest people in the online media industry were and two names came up again and again   Jonah Peretti  social   viral content  and Ze Frank  social video   I asked Jonah in my interview how he became this viral guru  Around 2001 Jonah was studying at MIT Media Lab and began running experiments in viral stories in an era before smart phones  2007  and before social networks took off  2004 2007  and before YouTube  2005   Back then there were  email forwards   For those too young to remember perhaps the best known of this era came in 1996 and was known as Dancing Baby  a strange  animated gif of   you guessed it   Jonah was working on his masters thesis and he asked Nike to produce a customized shoe with the word  Sweatshop  on it  Nike responded that  Nike was inappropriate slang  and they wouldn t make them  Jonah replied   No  actually sweatshop is in the dictionary and it means a shop or a factor where workers toil under unhealthy conditions   Nike wrote back another excuse not to make the shoes so Jonah asked   Would you at least send me a picture of the 10 year old Vietnamese girl who stitches my shoes together    This got passed around on email from person to person and became so popular it appeared on the Today Show where Jonah  admittedly not an expert in global factory conditions  appeared with Katie Couric and Nike s head of global PR and debated sweatshops    How was it possible for a student with no connections in the media industry to reach millions of people around the world just by making something and sharing it with a few friends    Perhaps we should have seen the signs 15 years ago of what was coming but these trends are hard to spot  At the time we heralded in a new era where  gatekeepers  were no longer going to shape stories to the public and  democratic news  would reign freely  Of course we all had the Utopian view as technologists often do but the laws of unintended consequences takes over   We discussed this as the social news website DIGG took off with this ethos and quickly became a clique where groups of influential DIGG publishers formed rings of voters that used Instant Messaging to hide their coordination and they were able to control the front page and thus huge volumes of traffic  This had an impact on the 2008 election where apparently groups of DIGG publishers would promote positive stories about Obama and negative stories about Hillary Clinton  sound familiar     I personally experienced the even more subversive side of DIGG when I learned that groups of people were actually demanding money to get stories on the DIGG homepage and I  the naive believer in online democracy and good intentions of people  learned about the black hat and gray hat monetization of the Internet  I would see this many times of the next decade where I learned that nearly every part of the web that involved monetization was immediately gamed and arms races emerged between platforms to combat abuse and people looking for a quick buck  In fact  the platforms weren t always so quick to crack down as many of them benefitted financially  Only when a platform felt its reputation might be impinged did they escalate to crack down on their newfound monetization  But I digress   I asked Jonah whether he thought it was a good idea that he seemed to be indifferent as to where his content was consumed as he was perhaps the first major online media company to abandon the idea that most of one s content must be consumed on your own website  industry term is O O   Owned   Operated website   Wasn t Jonah worried about  platform risks    Jonah said that didn t map to his views on the history of the media business or to his own experiences at BuzzFeed where he contents that he is being paid to produce content by companies like Facebook and Snapchat  Jonah pointed out that originally content companies had to pay cable companies to carry their content and then it became neutral and over time the cable companies actually paid large fees to content creators in order to get access to the highest quality content and differentiate their offering and avoid being commoditized  He sees the same situation playing out today in online media   Jonah believes that the media business is still mostly stuck in the traditional world where too many ad dollars and too much content is still produced in a traditional way but he thinks the next few years will change that dramatically as most competition switched to social  mobile   digital   I asked Jonah about his started position in photos  lists  GIFs and text and where he thought video fit in  Jonah said that 50  of BuzzFeed s revenue now comes from video and the pace of this change really surprised him  A few years ago Jonah acquired Ze Frank s video production company and the two of them have really built an enormous video production   distribution business  For example  one product alone   Tasty   is consumed by 500 million people per month  He thinks the very nature of video is changing  It s no longer necessarily just a long form  audio on format   it s becoming part of the fabric of the Internet    Video is the new HTML    I asked Jonah about his decision to get so heavily into the news business  which seemed as a big departure from  snackable content   Again he looked to the media industry history and pointed out that before Ted Turner founded CNN he had an entertainment channel  He thinks the history of media businesses show that they have three fundamental pillars  news  entertainment and advertising and you need to be great at all three of these things   You may notice in the pictures that Jonah is wearing a  Los Angeles  sweatshirt and I don t believe this was simply catering to me  Video has become such an integral part of what BuzzFeed does that Jonah actually moved with his family to Los Angeles  a further sign of the growing influence of the LA Tech Ecosystem   As the 2017 Upfront Summit came less than 2 weeks after the Trump inauguration I had to ask Jonah about some of the more controversial  and in this author s eyes   inspirational  decisions BuzzFeed had made   BuzzFeed famously turned down a seven figure upfront ad purchase from the RNC after Donald Trump won the election  I asked Jonah about this    I usually think of these  decisions  through the lens of my employees and because we create native advertising we re often producing the content and distributing it  And the idea that my employees many of whom felt directly attacked by the rhetoric on the campaign trail and they felt that their lives or their identities were directly attacked  The idea that they would then be assigned to make Trump ads   seemed pretty unacceptable    We talked about the role that employees now have in companies to advocate for their personal beliefs and perhaps force their leadership to take a more aggressive stance to protect their beliefs  in whatever direction   Of course we saw this in the case of Uber where employees and customers protested the CEO s decision to be on Donald Trump s business advisory council   Jonah   One of the shifts that surprised me was all of a sudden having employees say   hey will BuzzFeed help protect our reproductive rights   or  Will BuzzFeed help protect us if immigrants are attacked      Generally as a CEO of a company my expectation wasn t that my job would be to have to think about things like that  protecting his employees   Generally the rights of citizens are protected by The Constitution and by the government     I think you re seeing a lot more people who are looking to corporations or state governments or local government to protect them    This is an idea that interests me a great deal  If leaders of companies want to cozy up to an autocratic and kleptocratic president for personal gain or corporate gain while sacrificing rights of workers then these very workers should feel empowered to organize to hold their leadership accountable  Imagine if Oracle got more vocal about Safra Catz s relationship to Trump  Or maybe customers or partners and employees would be more inclined to work with Marc Benioff at Salesforce com who has put protection of the social rights of his employees front and center in how Salesforce conducts business   Lastly we had to talk about  the dossier   Perhaps you ve heard of it      I wanted to ask Jonah about the decision of BuzzFeed to publish the dossier of Donald Trump and his potential interest in rather exotic showers in Russia and whether that may have influenced his treatment of the US relationship with Russia to to  kompromat   compromising information potentially held about Trump   While the BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith had spoken about it publicly I had never heard any statements from BuzzFeed s CEO   You have to watch the video to get the full story  starting just after 23 30    but in essence it boils down to this   McCain had given the dossier to the FBI and the Gang of Eight had it  Obama and Trump had been briefed about it  CNN was referring to the document but not discussing the details of it  Harry Reid was referring to the dossier in oblique references  Everybody in elite positions in media and government knew the contents of the dossier and were making decisions based on the existence of it but the general public didn t know anything about it and BuzzFeed felt that was wrong  BuzzFeed published several disclaimers and even debunked some of the claims but felt ultimately it should be up to the public to see it and know what their government was reacting to  And Jonah stands by this decision stating that since the publication of the dossier a lot more research has gone into the claims and a lot of progress has been made in researching and tracking down details that wouldn t have happened had they not published it  He said reasonable people could come to different conclusions about this decision but they stand by their choice and he said anybody wanting to understand this better should watch this video between Brian Stelter and Ben Smith   If you have any interest in the future of online media or even better understanding fake news  why it exists and what to do about it   do yourself and watch this short 30 minute video interview  Jonah is truly a pioneer in online media,"[1111

1237,training-dataset/business/1238.txt,business,Why the LP Outlook is Good for Venture and Startups in 2017 2020Why the LP Outlook is Good for Venture and Startups in 2017 2020  Every year Upfront Ventures surveys Limited Partners  LPs  who are the main source of capital that invests in VC funds and thus the main source of capital that goes to startups to get an early warning sense of the year ahead  leaving aside any Black Swans   The results are in  and the full deck available  and a few things are clear   LPs are at their most optimistic phase about venture since the great recession of 2007 2009  LPs believe that the venture markets have permanently changed and there are now three distinct buckets in venture  seed  A B and growth stage  LPs have moved beyond their strict belief that there is  the best and the rest  and now acknowledge that some of the best performers in the past decade have been what a decade ago were emerging managers  or non existent  such as First Round Capital  Union Square Ventures  Lowercase Capital  Foundry Group  Spark Capital  IA Ventures  Founder Collective and many others  Note that all of these names were not started in Silicon Valley  So LPs are looking for a combination of  established top tier  and  new managers with differentiation    LPs now view co investment opportunities much more favorably than they did a decade ago  with almost half of all LPs quite active and 1 3rd saying it s one of the primary reasons they re in venture  LPs we surveyed  anonymously  pre inauguration  are overwhelmingly anti trump with zero respondents saying he was  the right leader  for our country  however  in equal numbers they don t believe that a Trump presidency is likely to have negative consequences for the Venture Capital and startup industry   So here are some details  please thank   follow  Chang Xu for her tireless effort in helping me prepare and analyze the data   If you met with LPs to raise a fund in 2009 2012 the most common refrain was   We have too many managers and too many dollars in venture  We re trying to limit our exposure   That has changed dramatically in the past five years  At the tail end of this period when demand was picking up for the industry there was still a belief that in venture it only mattered that you got into the top 10 funds in Silicon Valley   There is no doubt LPs still want access to the most elite funds but increasingly LPs have acknowledged that the industry has changed and some of the best performing managers have come from new firms and even many are outside of Silicon Valley thus LPs are more open to  new names    And while our entire industry s riches have grown and as startups have stayed private for longer periods of time and raised significantly more private capital than they did in the past  an increasing number of LPs have sought to do  co investments  win the funds that they back giving them more exposure to what they hope will be the better performing portfolio companies  If you want to understand why LPs are so active in venture these days  the most obvious reason is that technology startups have paid off handsomely for many LPs but a more nuanced answer would also include  relative to other asset classes   This is key because in a permanently low interest rate environment parking large pools of capital in assets that benefit from interest is not possible so LPs seek  higher yield   I know most startups  or even VCs  tend not to think about this but when you ask LPs the data are clear   Another trend we ve noticed in LP opinions is regarding seed funds  When people like Michael Kim at Cendana or Hans Swildens at Industry Ventures started focused on  Micro VCs  a decade ago or so we heard many LPs saying   I m not sure if seed fund investing is really a smart strategy  Will it last  Will they get squeezed  Will they have enough capital   We never hear that any more  Seed fund investing is acknowledged likely to be a permanent force in our industry with too many great funds to list but aside from those I listed previously there is obviously Felicis  Softtech  Floodgate  K9  Forerunner  Cowboy and so  so many more that I m already in trouble for not naming another 20 I respect   Late stage   growth VC sucks up the most amount of capital in aggregate in our industry and there was a movement by some of the larger VCs to say that traditional VCs would  get squeezed  but LPs don t buy it  More LPs said that traditional A B VC funds were the  best fit  for them than any other kind but the reality is that the largest response was that LPs wanted a  healthy mix  of Seed  A B and Growth   So    Not a single LP surveyed said Trump was the right leader for the United States and a clear 71  said they disliked Trump  were anti Trump or were  deeply offended  by Trump   But at the end of the day most LPs  like most VCs we surveyed  believe that the president likely won t have a major impact one way or the other on how the venture capital markets and therefore the underlying technology startup markets perform   If the mood of LPs that we surveyed is a reflection on how VCs get financed in the coming three years then a natural conclusion would be that entrepreneurs should continue to find the venture markets robust and capital available for great ideas and businesses with early traction  That said  of course all bets are off if there are unforeseen world events that cause markets to panic and one has to believe the chances of such a  black swan  are greater under a Trump presidency than any presidency in recent history   Here is the entire survey  which can also be downloaded and shared  If you need the original keynote slides for any reason   just ask,"[1237 748 828 894 267 495
