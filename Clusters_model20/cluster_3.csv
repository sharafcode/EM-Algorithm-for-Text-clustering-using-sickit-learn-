6,training-dataset/product/1281.txt,product,Beating designer s blockThose hours or days where you re working on a project and just can t seem to make any progress or come up with ideas  Thank designer s block for that   We ve all been there  Sometimes no amount of coffee  walks around the block  or cat videos can help you shake the feeling that it s just not happening  And that s a terrible feeling to have especially if you ve got a rapidly approaching deadline and a client who keeps asking how things are going   Let s take a look at why designer s block happens and how to overcome it   Where does designer s block come from   Designers constantly use 2 parts of the brain  the prefrontal cortex and the cerebral cortex   Your ability to make smart decisions comes from your prefrontal cortex  while your creativity and creative thinking come from your cerebral cortex   When you design  or tackle tricky UX problems   your brain works hard to make sure you re the best damn designer you can be   Although it s a little different  think about these parts of your brain as muscles  Imagine going to the gym every day and doing the same exercise you d get tired and stiff  things would start to slow down a little  and eventually your body would say no more   When you re hit with designer s block  there s a good chance that s the reason  You ve done such an amazing job  for such a long time  that you might just need a break   If you re finding that your main block is creativity  then something  somewhere  is probably causing you stress  Because our limbic system manages our fight or flight response  stress causes your body  and brain  to keep you safe  When your limbic system is active  energy is taken away from the cerebral cortex  the creative part of your brain  for this very reason   On the other hand  if you re struggling to make decent decisions  which could be anything from color and font choices  to finishing user workflows   then decision fatigue is probably starting to set in  Decision fatigue happens when your prefrontal cortex is constantly making decisions for a long period of time  You ve probably felt this before when you ve come out of a long brainstorming session  or after you ve been asked to solve a complex problem  This is another common cause for designer s block because as designers  we re constantly making decisions   So how do we overcome designer s block   Arguably the best way to start overcoming designers block is this  Spend a few minutes finding out how you re feeling and where the the issue truly lies   Sometimes you ll notice that it s your decision making that s acting as a barrier  And if that s the case  there are a few quick fixes that ll quickly get you back on track   When creativity is your barrier  take a more mindful approach to tackling the issue  Sometimes  it can be a little tricky to do  but we ll get there together   When you re struggling to make decisions  recharge  If your prefrontal cortex is exhausted and you re making  or can t even make  bad decisions  then you need to refuel   There s a study that shows judges find it increasingly difficult to make decisions on sentencing and parole as their day drags on   The remedy for this  Food   Judges were given a sandwich and an apple on their breaks  and their ability to make better decisions increased exponentially   When you re struggling to make decisions  recharge with a snack you enjoy  Feeding your body gives your brain the boost it needs to stay on top   If food isn t working  or you ve eaten and there s no difference   then prioritize the decisions that matter to you  It s safe to assume that the majority of designers use  and maybe live in  their smartphones   Well  every time we make a decision to send a tweet  take a snap  or swipe right  we re using our prefrontal cortex to carry that out  Since we re alway connected  it can be tough to step away from social media and other apps especially while we re trying to work   Prioritize your time on decisions that matter  and give your brain a break from those that don t   And if you re still struggling to get past this side of designer s block  then recharge your personal batteries with some rest   You can look at taking a vacation or asking for a few days off  but in reality you might only need 10 15 minutes to step away  sit down  put your headphones in  and find your happy place   Resting is just as important as putting in hard work  So when you find your decision making skills lacking  don t be afraid to step away   When you re struggling with creativity  use your head  My team has come up with a few different ways to beat designer s block after all  deadlines are deadlines and the show must go on   Do a visualization exercise  These help re engage the cerebral cortex without adding to any existing stress  Forcing an idea doesn t work   Start by closing your eyes or grabbing a piece of paper  Think of a word  then describe or draw what comes to mind  Don t force it  If the word doesn t resonate with you  find another  If you re struggling to find words  let the random word generator to do the heavy lifting for you   Go for a brisk walk around the block to clear your head  Leave your phone at your desk so you can pay attention to your surroundings   Clarify instructions and briefs  Then  when designer s block hits  you can work in a process driven way   A handy list of quick tips   Never make a decision or work for too long on an empty stomach  Take 5 to relax  Think about what s on your mind and tackle it  Stay mindful and open to issues that arise  Do the toughest and most important things first  Go on vacation and visit a new place  Tokyo is one of our favorites   Visualize what you need to do paint the bigger picture  Exercise or take a walk around the block  Make sure everything s clear  If you need more information  just ask   So go and beat designer s block  You ve totally got this,"[6 1316 25 1280 609 1145 799

25,training-dataset/product/288.txt,product,Design in the age of everything all the timeTechnology has brought us the world at our fingertips  Shopping  dating  learning  work  entertainment you name it  and it s instantly available  24 hours a day   But this abundance comes at a price  We feel exhausted and overwhelmed  like someone else is behind the wheel  There s always another thing to do  another task  another option  another decision to make  A line from The Eagles  hit song  Life In The Fast Lane  probably sums it up best   Everything  all the time   You might think this is just the price we pay for 21st century living to get the upside of our technology powered existence  we must suffer the downside  But does it really have to be that way   In his book The Design of Everyday Things  Don Norman writes that when things don t work as expected  it is designers who are at fault  Products are consciously designed  and they don t appear out of thin air  People create the objects we use with specific intentions  and those intentions influence our lives often more than we realize   Norman writes mainly about the designer s responsibility to make sure the object is intuitive to use  but there s a broader implication  Our technology  our computers  our smartphones  the internet  is designed for everything  all the time  By making it easy to switch from one thing to another with a click  computers encourage multitasking  The default mode for our apps is to notify us of everything that happens to anyone at any time  The internet has turned the world into a 24 7 convenience store   In such an environment  is it strange we find it harder to control our impulses  To discipline ourselves to do what s right  This is the product designer s intent at work whether conscious or not  When you design for an always on world  it s no wonder you end up with always on users   No limits  Perhaps the change that swept over us in the past decade is best illustrated by a story from my own life  In my early twenties  I made a living doing video productions  Music videos  small commercials  sometimes even weddings   One of my clients was an event organizer in the south of the country  a 2 and a half hour train ride from Amsterdam  where I lived  Every Friday night  I was the VJ  video jockey  at one of their regular club nights  meaning I was responsible for the visuals on all the screens around the venue   Initially I didn t own a laptop to produce these videos  By Thursday night  I needed to have all the footage prepared in the studio in Amsterdam  so that it could be processed and put onto VHS tapes  and later DVDs  overnight  Naturally  this caused a lot of stress and last minute work before catching the train down south on Friday  but in the end I always hit the road prepared and ready for the night   Then I bought a laptop and everything changed  I could now continue my work and preparations on the train  I could even finalize my DVDs on the night itself because of the built in DVD burner   Initially  this seemed like a blessing  but soon it also brought out the worst in me  I now planned  delayed   everything until the last minute  I ended up working even more hours  There was never any downtime  and stress increased  The laptop broke down an invisible barrier that previously forced some discipline and sanity  humanness   onto me  to finish my work before leaving the studio  To enjoy my thoughts  or a book  on the train ride  To be completely prepared and ready when the event started on Friday night   Too familiar  If you experienced life before laptops and smartphones  you ll probably find parallels to my story in your own life  Work you now take home that used to be done in the office  Your first waking hour spent in your inbox instead of enjoying breakfast with a newspaper  Confirming and rescheduling appointments at the absolute last possible moment   The list goes on   When we finally do take a moment to look up from our screens and reflect  we realize the constraints of our previous technology were not all that bad  We didn t notice it at the time  but some of those limitations were actually good for us  triggering disciplined and healthier behavior  This is not to say we should all downgrade to Windows 95 and a Nokia  brick  phone  but perhaps we can take a cue from Don Norman  Design matters in more ways than just the aesthetic or physical use  It also influences our health and behavior   Time well spent  The good news is that some designers are arriving at this exact conclusion  With his Time Well Spent initiative  Tristan Harris is the vanguard of this shift   Let s build a movement for technology designed to help us spend time well  is the motto  And why not  The paradox is that most of us assume our technology has to function in the way it does  In reality  it does not  Those are all design choices   There is no technological requirement that says your smartphone should alert you to everything 24 7  There is no directive stating your computer needs to facilitate multitasking  something the human brain is simply incapable of   There is no law that requires you to stare into a screen while on the subway   It s all man made  and that means man can also undo it   Yes  but who and how   There are many ways in which we can rethink our devices and technology from the ground up  something we re keen to do at Saent  taking a cue from the philosophy of Time Well Spent   but this is going to take time   The incumbents in this area  Apple  Google  Facebook  Microsoft  are unlikely to change their ways  but even if they did  it ll still take time  And similarly  it takes lots of time and effort before new initiatives like Time Well Spent and Saent change the way we live   In the meantime  a good place to start is with ourselves  as designers and creators of products and experiences  Changing the foundation of the technological ecosystem is not easy  but each small contribution contributes to the larger wave of change  Is that push notification really necessary  Does that comment really need to trigger an email  Am I adding this feature because it s beneficial to the user  or mainly because it improves our product metrics   To go from everything  all the time to time well spent  here are some guiding principles to keep in mind when you design  This list is by no means complete or even unchangeable see it as a conversation starter   Design for Time Well Spent  Value the user s time and attention in everything you design  Ask yourself  Am I adding this feature because it s beneficial to the user  or merely to suck them in to improve my metrics  The powerful psychological tricks that today s software developers use to hook users are well documented  but are they always right to employ  Recognize that there s a burden placed on users whenever you design a never ending feedback loop  or suck them back with addictive digital triggers and rewards   More on timewellspent io   Design with the brain in mind  Most of our modern work comes down to making optimal use of our brains  But the brain cannot multitask  It cannot sustain attention for longer than 60 90 minutes at a time  It cannot stay calm when overloaded with information  Study the brain and learn what it likes and dislikes   then create designs in harmony with that almighty human organ  the book BrainChains is a good place to start   Design for human beings  We are not robots  We need to spend quality time with other humans  We need fresh air  and we need to get up and move once in a while  We need to spend time with our families  We need to learn and develop ourselves  There s no reason why our technology should push us away from those things  Instead  it could nudge us towards them   Read more about our vision for the future in Empowering Human Intelligence    Adjust this list  expand on it let s make it great together  There s no reason why technology should cause us stress  exhaustion  and other problems  Our digital tools have the potential to be liberating and allow us to reach greater heights of human potential  but change only happens when we envision such a future and start working towards it   What would you add to the list   Tell us on Twitter   InVisionApp,"[25 154 609 561 585 693 649 985 1316 667 782]"

51,training-dataset/business/2.txt,business,41 Lessons Learned after Five Years as a Startup Founder41 Lessons Learned after Five Years as a Startup Founder  Greatist turns five tomorrow   Five years is a major milestone   It feels like just yesterday I was working out of a 24 hour Starbucks in San Francisco and no one had ever heard of Greatist  I was convincing early employees to take nearly unpaid jobs and move into our first office  also my apartment  in NYC  and I was manually re starting the DNS server every time we hit 1000 consecutive visitors  It seems like just yesterday I was pitching this crazy idea that a new  defining consumer health brand could change the way people thought about  healthy  and I wasn t going to stop until I built it   I ve found Year Five to be the most grounding year yet  a year where both the organization and I matured most  It s the year we started making money in earnest and even became profitable  It s the year we reached  and beat  the 10M unique visitors per month promised land  It s the year the team size doubled and the team average age almost doubled as well  yup  suddenly half the people that report to me have kids   REAL kids    If an entrepreneur s life is measured in Pok mon  let s say it s the year I evolved from Charmander to Charmeleon and am well on my way to Charizard  I looked it up and apparently now there s a thing called Mega Charizard  which I guess is Jeff Bezos level    It s the year I not only starting internalizing and appreciating what the role of a CEO fully is  but took meaningful steps to get there  It s the year we crossed the threshold from sorta kinda not institutionally backed company to absolutely venture backed company  It s the year I regained some swagger after what feels like years of getting my hubris beaten out of me  And it s the year I continued my journey to being the most calm  most disciplined  most courageous person in every room   It s a major milestone   To commemorate these hard  crazy  beautiful five years I ve yet again put some time into writing and sharing my eight lessons learned  If curious  check out Year Four  Year Three  Year Two  and Year One  I ve also moved  and lightly edited  the other four years of lessons learned from my personal blog  ha   remember blogs   to Medium in the hopes that this can become a real resource more than just a throwaway blog post  As I say every year  I write this for me  not you  That said  I d be thrilled if these lessons help you build something special  I definitely believe  a rising tide lifts all boats  and we need more awesome freakin  boats   Anyway  here goes   1  Simplicity is mad powerful   If a startup s key advantages are  focus and speed   with speed  IMO  mostly deriving from focus   then a startup s leader must be the most focused  And I ve struggled with this for a long time  I ve always looked ahead to what s next and what s new  thinking actively about what part  if any  we should play  But I ve now started to really relish the power of focus in an organization   Like me  or probably because of me   Greatist struggled with focus the first few years but now we ve swung far in the other direction   we ve never had a more focused year than Year Five  We didn t get distracted by almost anything  working purposefully on taking our next gen media company to the next level   and we absolutely achieved that   Similarly  I ve been on an intense simplification kick myself to boot  I went on an intense purge of everything that  pushed  at me  I stopped posting to Twitter 5 10 times a day and deleted Twitter  Facebook  and Swarm  sorry Foursquare   from my phone entirely  I turning off all notifications  literally as many as I could figure out how to turn off   I unsubscribed from every email I was getting  just cause   I removed myself from every RSS feed  yes  I use RSS  that was about tech  business  and politics  sorry outside world    I stopped following all health and wellness sites  except Greatist  obviously   And doesn t just feel good  it feels great  It even feels great just to write all that out  My mind is so much clearer  able to better focus on things that actually matter   Focus is a secret super power  I don t miss any distractions and I don t miss anything important  I was addicted  FOMO   to notifications about things that literally don t matter and have no bearing on my life  Everything I really need to hear about  I still do  And of course there s still value in unstructured exploration and Wikipedia rabbit holes  at least I think so    I just adventure when I want to  not when someone else interrupts me and tells me to   2  Making money is great   Last year we went from just about zero dollars in revenue to profitable  well  a little over break even  and it changed everything   We accomplished this over 4 5 years with just a little over  3M raised  Then  in January we announced our Series A led by Floodgate and  though we re well on our way to doubling in team size  if things go to plan we ll be profitable again by the end of the year  Yay money   I ve always wanted to run lean and bootstrap y  so we have   I ve always wanted to be in financial control of our future  so we are   Given the type of company we are today  media  and the business model we have today  brand partnerships   this is the right strategic decision to build the best and biggest long term company  not a compromise  Of course  this doesn t apply to every company  But I ve always felt the revenue generating path was the right one  so I feel some validation now that making money is in vogue again  It was also a welcome surprise that the minute we were making real money  investors wanted to give us real money  Funny the way that works  Profitability even let us find an incredible  terrifically aligned investor in terms of both mission and strategic plan  When we didn t need to raise  I got to choose which partner I wanted most   As an aside  this year I also learned the value of hiring a full time accountant  When our investors  CFO  and advisors all suggested it independently I decided it d be worth looking into  at least  but wasn t sure what an accountant would do all day  We hired a terrific senior accountant in January and she s had far too much to do and been an extraordinary help   Thanks Sabrina   It s not a sexy hire  maybe  but do it   3  Successfully raising money means more stress  not less   I know few companies that have had a more seamless and stress free Series A fundraise than we did   That s maybe mostly due to how awesome Ann and Floodgate are  But it also helped that we didn t  need  to raise  that we were making money  etc  I wasn t perfect doing my first major raise  but I d like to think I did okay and most importantly we did it right for Greatist   we have a terrific mission aligned partner  we didn t raise more than we needed  we didn t raise at a crazy valuation that limits our future flexibility  and all the  little  things that matter to founders fell the right  fair way   Great  right  But suddenly there was four times more money than I ve ever seen in our bank account and  instead of breathing a sigh of relief and working up the courage to pay for the buffet at Golden Corral  real luxury  guys   I honestly can t remember a time I ve felt more stressed out and anxious   There s no real external pressure on me to  put the money to work  or triple revenue  just the opposite   everyone is pushing me to build the best long term business without compromising culture or brand  But internally I feel more pressure than ever to make the most of the skills I ve been gifted  the resources I ve been granted  the team I ve recruited  I feel more overwhelming responsibility to make good on the difference I set out to make with Greatist  the impact on the world it s my life mission to achieve  I ve never had more of a chance to do that and I ve never felt less prepared and less worthy of the burden   So my anxiety is unexpectedly through the freakin  roof  Everything s on track and things have never been better  but I feel more stressed out than ever  Maybe that makes me good at this  maybe that makes me bad  Maybe it s about money being burned again  maybe it s about my nightmare scenario of growing too fast   compromising brand and culture for short term gains   Whatever it is  people often warn that raising money can ironically come at a cost   so add stress and anxiety to that list  I guess   4  Businesses built for the long term win   I m consistently surprised  shocked  even  by how few founders I meet are purposefully and intentionally building long term businesses   It s not my role to judge anyone else s reasons for starting a company  it s hard no matter what   but I just don t get why anyone would want to put themselves through the excruciating journey of founding a business without deeply  profoundly wanting that business to last   Every founder will say they re passionate about what they re building  but it s too rare to find authentic passion and that just bums me out  It s too rare to find people who genuinely care about building a special culture because they realize its importance in helping their company succeed  It s too rare to find folks who really want to build billion dollar businesses  to really  to make investment decisions in light of long term market leadership considerations   and are crazy enough to believe they can do it   Maybe it s something to do with the market these past few years or with The Social Network  not kidding   I don t know  But even though that s disappointing  this isn t about comparison  After all  I only truly compete against is myself   Five years ago I started Greatist explicitly because I wanted to build something that mattered  something that I d wake up  yup   five years into and be just as if not more excited about building and sharing it with the world  So far so good   But I ve spent a long time feeling shameful  almost apologizing for being a heart and vision driven entrepreneur  But that s bullshit and I m done with it  I m absolutely a heart driven founder  building the company I most wished existed growing up and I m most grateful exists today  There s never been a brand in health that people love and trust because it s really  truly on their side  It s been too easy to make money in healthy the easy way   and that s just super messed up  So  yeah  it s my life mission to give everyone  everywhere a  health attitude  so they can find what s good for them  Not just because I think that s an awesome business opportunity  but also because I m convinced that s the only way for anyone to be succeed at being healthy long term   I hope Greatist is the platform with which we can make good on that mission  If not  it ll be the next Greatist   Anyway  I m tired of pretending that I m not this  I am   5  Start recruiting way earlier   People are everything  so there s no doubt a CEO s primary responsibility is building the best team   At Greatist  we have no trouble convincing amazing folks to come work at Greatist   we ve never been so truly a  rocket ship  with an incredible culture  special team  and important mission to boot  But the best people are rarely looking for jobs  They re rarely motivated by money alone  They ve often gone out of their way to find a great place to work already and they ve been heads down working ever since  Long story short  it s been almost unbelievably hard to find special talent   I ve recently heard more and more people say a CEO s job is at least 50  recruiting  hiring  and retaining great people  And I ve been trying to get there  We ve been able to hire some really great people over the past few months  and already have really terrific people working for us  too     but most came through pre existing relationships of mine or my team s  In retrospect  I should have been doing a much better job the past few years at prioritizing getting to know great people just to get to know them and before we needed to hire so many of them  a number I know will only continue to grow   I wish I had been spending this much time recruiting before we needed it so badly   Similarly  letting people go is a crucial part of growth  Sounds counterintuitive  of course  and it s always unfortunate and tough  but being unafraid to fire someone when it s the correct thing to do can come at enormous cost to the team  the culture  and the company  In fact  we ve rarely let people go for not doing their job well   it s most often been about great people no longer fitting with the team  evolving priorities on our end  and or changing professional interests on theirs   so finding another opportunity is usually relatively quick  and we help if we can    It s never easy  though  to let someone go and even harder for managers to recognize its power for the first time  As I m involved less and less with more and more team members  I ve learned to be better at reminding my managers to remember that s a tool they can use and encouraging them to use it if need be   6  Being the  calmest person in the room  only gets more important   and harder   As the company grows  things change   Shocker  I know    I actually love the change  finding myself missing the  early days  little and instead relishing the challenge of each new stage more compelling   Of course  my role as CEO role continues to evolve as well  The less I work directly with team members  the more careful I need to be in terms of what  where  and how I say things  I forget sometimes that I m now just  the boss  to many of them  that they don t know me or my style well enough to know quite what that offhanded comment  exasperated sigh  brief mention of a task I think needs more priority  or well intended comment about a co worker really means  When I say something  people take it super seriously  When I seem stressed  people worry  When I slack an innocuous suggestion  people drop everything else to put it into action   In some ways  as the company grows  my latitude shrinks  I m not surprised about all this  but didn t expect  or maybe notice  the drastic change until recently  For one  this underscores the importance of having high level senior leadership I trust to know me well enough  and sometimes translate what I meant to others   For two  this also emphasizes my continued journey to be the most stable and calm person in the room  Ultimately  I can t forget how profoundly I set the tone for our organization  It s humbling and even a little scary how big of an impact the energy I bring each day to work can have   this is both a burden and a great opportunity   In the early days of Greatist  the team voted everyone a  superlative  of sorts   things like  the heart    the spirit    the spice   I was voted  the energy  and was frankly disappointed   was that all I was to the team  I wondered  Isn t a CEO and founder s role bigger than that  Looking back  though  I totally get it   it s less about my personal energy  I ve got a lot of it  and more about the motivated but focused  adventurous but calm  optimistic but honest energy I try to bring to the team  And that energy has to continue to be authentic to me  not a mask or a front  or it simply falls flat   I m not always perfect  and have off days  too    but I think overall my journey to be vulnerable  grateful  and present is well on its way   7  Innovate or die  Dramatic  I know    Walt Disney famously saw his theme park  Disneyland  as a place that would never be completed  one he could constantly continue to improve   and improve it he did  It s a testament to his legacy that his company  Disney  continues that spirit through impressive  often ballsy  improvements   investing billions of dollars to acquire new IP  introduce digital payments via the MagicBand  and more  As many traditional media companies stumble and become irrelevant  Disney only seems to get better   and that s in no small part because of its lack of fear to embrace new technology and try new things   It only becomes clearer and clearer that if your company s not on the cutting edge  you re done  If innovation and taking risks isn t built into your team s DNA  fuggedaboutit  Every couple years at Greatist we re suddenly behind again after feeling like we re far ahead  And the speed of this acceleration is exponentially  not incrementally  increasing   Looking back at Greatist s history  there s been at least three major times when we ve had WFIO conversations   one year in when we realized we needed to focus on a niche demo  which led us to Pinterest   two and half years in when we realized writing great content wasn t enough  which led us to hiring a mostly new editorial team that lived and breathed social   and three and a half years in when we realized I needed to sell brand partnerships to learn what worked and what didn t myself  which led us to hiring the right sales team for the first time   Those WFIO conversations were humbling and hard  but not throwing in the towel enabled us to get ahead of the curve and resulted in our biggest periods of growth   finding  and nailing  Pinterest led us to breaking 3M unique visitors per month  our new editorial team led us to 10M uniques plus brand legitimacy  and our new sales team led us to a mostly profitable 2015  Isn t it fascinating that moments of semi crisis led to such big leaps forward   I think in every case above it simply took  nearly  too long for me to identify what was up  It s been hard for me to step outside of the day to day  yet working  on  the business and not  in  it is the only way to turn these challenges into opportunities  So I m actively working harder  and hiring smarter  to get me closer to just being CEO  Similarly  being radically candid about what s going on and coming up with innovative ideas can t just be my job  so I m also actively trying to find ways for every level of our team to think and act in more of the same way   8  A company s core values evolve and that s a good thing   Long ago during our founding I set forth our company values  Every person who s started a job at Greatist has learned them and  I believe  lived them  They stemmed not only from what I thought this company should stand for  but also the early team we had put together  They were my first legitimate stab at creating a company s core values and  frankly  they were good  They shaped who we hired  what we did  and how we worked  But as the company continued to grow  I felt more and more like we could do better  As we matured as an organization  I felt the words we used to capture our core values weren t keep pace with our growth  So we set out to re communicate what we stood for internally  Here s what we did   first we held an open meeting where the whole team was invited to brainstorm things our culture stood for  We gathered these and more suggestions together  then I condensed all of them into loose categories  We then held another open meeting where the team ranked and rated the categories in terms of which resonated most  Then I spent a couple airplane trips working through each of them  naming and renaming  combining and de coupling  and organizing and re organizing before coming up with a first draft  I then gathered feedback from both our senior leadership and our most tenured team members  both inputs having a meaningful effect on the final stage  Then I purposefully let them sit for a few weeks  altering them just a touch before revealing them to everyone at our quarterly gretreat  that s what we call our  retreats    In fact  we themed the whole retreat on values  personal and professional   bringing in outside facilitators and then  thanks to an idea from the amazing Amanda   we did an exercise where each team member brainstormed  behaviors  for each company core value and then  in groups  combined them into three representative behaviors  I m very proud of the evolution of our core values and very proud of the thoughtful  collaborative process we took to get there  Most of all  I m proud we embraced how our company values evolved   and weren t afraid to update them in a way that feels even more true  instructive and inspiring  to what we ve built   For what it s worth  I also spent a lot of time  prompted by our awesome Romena  creating my own core values  They re courage  authenticity  play  disciple  and impact    9  Change in health isn t coming   it s here    Bonus lesson    Five years ago  I would have said we re starting to see a profound shift in terms of how the world sees health   Now everyone can see that change   you can see it in the announcements enormous food manufacturers  retailers  and restaurant chains have made  real food  not processed  and in the types of things celebrities swear they re into now  juice cleanses  not binge drinking    According to a recent study by The Cassandra Report  73  of millennials would rather be  healthy  than  wealthy   This stunning stat illustrates how dramatically our generation differs from generations in the past   healthy more than wealthy  Heck yeah   When I started Greatist  I was afraid the healthy living brand that succeeds with millennials would be built for the wrong reasons  After all  it s been tragically easy to succeed in health and wellness by doing it the  easy  way   selling products  or  worse  a lifestyle  full of empty promises and praying on people s insecurities  I had no doubt society would be taking health exponentially more seriously   I just hoped they d have a brand that helped them approach it in a healthy  long term  sustainable way  That s the very reason I started Greatist   partly because I was terrified someone else would build something that wasn t actually on our side and partly based on the opportunity to positively shape how we get better   There s no doubt timing and luck play a very important role in a startup s success  so I feel very lucky we ve had some of both  I m also convinced we haven t only been riding a wave  but also playing a pivotal role in shaping the wave   As the wave continues to grow  however  we only have a bigger and bigger responsibility to harness it and keep it heading in the right direction  It s a start  at least  I ve learned a lot of things the hard way  but it s nice to know I was at least right about the market timing  Now s when it only gets even more important to take advantage of and

64,training-dataset/business/287.txt,business,No CEO  The Swedish company where nobody is in chargeMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Staff at Swedish firm Crisp explain why they decided to bin the boss  Do you really need someone to tell you what to do at work   Three years ago  Swedish software consultancy Crisp decided that the answer was no   The firm  which has about 40 staff  had already trialled various organisational structures  including the more common practice of having a single leader running the company   Crisp then tried changing its chief executive annually  based on a staff vote  but eventually decided collectively that no boss was needed   Yassal Sundman  a developer at the firm  explains   We said   what if we had nobody as our next CEO   what would that look like   And then we went through an exercise and listed down the things that the CEO does    The staff decided that many of the chief executive s responsibilities overlapped with those of the board  while other roles could be shared among other employees    When we looked at it we had nothing left in the CEO column  and we said   all right  why don t we try it out    says Ms Sundman   Image caption The firm has detailed etiquette rules for its meetings  Crisp holds four day meetings for all staff two to three times a year  They are used to making decisions on issues that affect everyone  such as an office move  but workers are encouraged to make decisions themselves at other times   It also still has a board   a legal requirement   and this can be used as a last resort to resolve issues if something is not working   Henrik Kniberg  an organisational coach at the firm  argues that not having to ask a boss for decisions on projects or budgets means the firm can respond faster    If you want to get something done  you stand up and start driving that   he says   Yet Mr Kniberg stresses that not having to ask permission does not remove the need for staff to discuss issues or bounce ideas off each other   Because they are all in charge  workers are more motivated  he argues  Crisp regularly measures staff satisfaction  and the average is about 4 1 out of five   Image caption Crisp s Yassal Sundman says the chief executive s responsibilities are shared out  The company is set up like a family  says Mr Kniberg  While nobody tells anyone exactly what to do  the unspoken understanding is that you don t mess up the house   But what if the rest of the staff feel that one worker has made a terrible decision   Ms Sundman says that is okay   At least you did the thing that was right in the moment   and then we can have a discussion about it  You can explain why it is that you thought this was a good way  and actually you might get everybody else to think the same way    Ultimately  the firm hopes that its way of working could inspire other companies to emulate the  Crisp DNA    Image caption Crisp staff all have an equal say in how the firm is run  they tell CEO coach Steve Tappin  Although Crisp s move may seem radical  plenty of companies have trialled a similar arrangement  One of the best known is online shoe and clothing retailer Zappos  which is owned by Amazon   In 2013 the firm adopted a new management structure called  holacracy   which was intended to eliminate workplace hierarchy and foster collaboration   However  almost a fifth of Zappos staff subsequently departed  with chief executive Tony Hsieh admitting that  self management is not for everyone    While there is a growing trend for flatter organisational structures   meaning fewer middle managers and bosses   most of the more radical experiments are taking place in small start ups   As well as employing fewer people  such firms do not have the long corporate history that can make major changes much more difficult to implement   Image copyright Reuters Image caption Infinite freedom at work  doesn t always feel good   says Dropbox founder Drew Houston  Drew Houston  founder of online file sharing service Dropbox  does not believe a leaderless structure can work in larger firms because it would be too chaotic   The main risk  he says  is that staff will encroach into each other s areas of responsibility  making them less efficient    Often infinite freedom like that can be pretty disorientating  It doesn t always feel good  because you no longer know what you re supposed to do  what s important and you re bumping up against other people   Mr Houston says   Similarly  Meg Whitman  chief executive of technology giant Hewlett Packard Enterprise  HPE   firmly believes that companies need a leader    You ve got to have the accountability  because if people in your organisation don t know what they re doing and how it affects the customers  then you ve got a disconnect problem   she says   Image copyright Hewlett Packard Enterprise Image caption HPE boss Meg Whitman says companies must have a leader to make decisions  However  HPE has tackled one problem that hinders many big companies  the time it takes to make decisions    We tended to let decisions sit for way too long a time   Ms Whitman says   So we now have a little saying at Hewlett Packard Enterprise  you ve got to escalate a decision or a challenge and you have to resolve it in 48 hours    CEO coach and author Steve Tappin says even if firms are sceptical of companies that don t have a single boss  it is worth paying attention to the likes of Crisp    Many businesses may not want to go as far as getting rid of their chief executive  but there are valid lessons to be learnt from radical companies like Crisp   he says   This feature is based on interviews by CEO coach and author Steve Tappin  and by series producer Neil Koenig  for the BBC s CEO Guru series,"[64 284 721 259 863 612 595 824 1319 1316 154]"

71,training-dataset/engineering/125.txt,engineering,Economic Inequality        January 2016    Since the 1970s  economic inequality in the US has increased dramatically  And in particular  the rich have gotten a lot richer  Nearly everyone who writes about it says that economic inequality should be decreased     I m interested in this topic because I was one of the founders of a company called Y Combinator that helps people start startups  Almost by definition  if a startup succeeds its founders become rich  Which means by helping startup founders I ve been helping to increase economic inequality  If economic inequality should be decreased  I shouldn t be helping founders  No one should be     But that doesn t sound right  So have we just shown  by reductio ad absurdum  that it s false that economic inequality should be decreased  That doesn t sound right either  Surely it s bad that some people are born practically locked into poverty  while at the other extreme fund managers exploit loopholes to cut their income taxes in half     The solution to this puzzle is to realize that economic inequality is not just one thing  It consists of some things that are very bad  like kids with no chance of reaching their potential  and others that are good  like Larry Page and Sergey Brin starting the company you use to find things online     If you want to understand economic inequality and more importantly  if you actually want to fix the bad aspects of it you have to tease apart the components  And yet the trend in nearly everything written about the subject is to do the opposite  to squash together all the aspects of economic inequality as if it were a single phenomenon     Sometimes this is done for ideological reasons  Sometimes it s because the writer only has very high level data and so draws conclusions from that  like the proverbial drunk who looks for his keys under the lamppost  instead of where he dropped them  because the light is better there  Sometimes it s because the writer doesn t understand critical aspects of inequality  like the role of technology in wealth creation  Much of the time  perhaps most of the time  writing about economic inequality combines all three     ___    The most common mistake people make about economic inequality is to treat it as a single phenomenon  The most naive version of which is the one based on the pie fallacy  that the rich get rich by taking money from the poor     Usually this is an assumption people start from rather than a conclusion they arrive at by examining the evidence  Sometimes the pie fallacy is stated explicitly     those at the top are grabbing an increasing fraction of the nation s income so much of a larger share that what s left over for the rest is diminished       1   Other times it s more unconscious  But the unconscious form is very widespread  I think because we grow up in a world where the pie fallacy is actually true  To kids  wealth is a fixed pie that s shared out  and if one person gets more it s at the expense of another  It takes a conscious effort to remind oneself that the real world doesn t work that way     In the real world you can create wealth as well as taking it from others  A woodworker creates wealth  He makes a chair  and you willingly give him money in return for it  A high frequency trader does not  He makes a dollar only when someone on the other end of a trade loses a dollar     If the rich people in a society got that way by taking wealth from the poor  then you have the degenerate case of economic inequality where the cause of poverty is the same as the cause of wealth  But instances of inequality don t have to be instances of the degenerate case  If one woodworker makes 5 chairs and another makes none  the second woodworker will have less money  but not because anyone took anything from him     Even people sophisticated enough to know about the pie fallacy are led toward it by the custom of describing economic inequality as a ratio of one quantile s income or wealth to another s  It s so easy to slip from talking about income shifting from one quantile to another  as a figure of speech  into believing that is literally what s happening     Except in the degenerate case  economic inequality can t be described by a ratio or even a curve  In the general case it consists of multiple ways people become poor  and multiple ways people become rich  Which means to understand economic inequality in a country  you have to go find individual people who are poor or rich and figure out why    2      If you want to understand change in economic inequality  you should ask what those people would have done when it was different  This is one way I know the rich aren t all getting richer simply from some new system for transferring wealth to them from everyone else  When you use the would have method with startup founders  you find what most would have done back in 1960   when economic inequality was lower  was to join big companies or become professors  Before Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook  his default expectation was that he d end up working at Microsoft  The reason he and most other startup founders are richer than they would have been in the mid 20th century is not because of some right turn the country took during the Reagan administration  but because progress in technology has made it much easier to start a new company that grows fast      Traditional economists seem strangely averse to studying individual humans  It seems to be a rule with them that everything has to start with statistics  So they give you very precise numbers about variation in wealth and income  then follow it with the most naive speculation about the underlying causes     But while there are a lot of people who get rich through rent seeking of various forms  and a lot who get rich by playing games that though not crooked are zero sum  there are also a significant number who get rich by creating wealth  And creating wealth  as a source of economic inequality  is different from taking it not just morally  but also practically  in the sense that it is harder to eradicate  One reason is that variation in productivity is accelerating  The rate at which individuals can create wealth depends on the technology available to them  and that grows exponentially  The other reason creating wealth is such a tenacious source of inequality is that it can expand to accommodate a lot of people     ___    I m all for shutting down the crooked ways to get rich  But that won t eliminate great variations in wealth  because as long as you leave open the option of getting rich by creating wealth  people who want to get rich will do that instead     Most people who get rich tend to be fairly driven  Whatever their other flaws  laziness is usually not one of them  Suppose new policies make it hard to make a fortune in finance  Does it seem plausible that the people who currently go into finance to make their fortunes will continue to do so but be content to work for ordinary salaries  The reason they go into finance is not because they love finance but because they want to get rich  If the only way left to get rich is to start startups  they ll start startups  They ll do well at it too  because determination is the main factor in the success of a startup    3   And while it would probably be a good thing for the world if people who wanted to get rich switched from playing zero sum games to creating wealth  that would not only not eliminate great variations in wealth  but might even exacerbate them  In a zero sum game there is at least a limit to the upside  Plus a lot of the new startups would create new technology that further accelerated variation in productivity     Variation in productivity is far from the only source of economic inequality  but it is the irreducible core of it  in the sense that you ll have that left when you eliminate all other sources  And if you do  that core will be big  because it will have expanded to include the efforts of all the refugees  Plus it will have a large Baumol penumbra around it  anyone who could get rich by creating wealth on their own account will have to be paid enough to prevent them from doing it     You can t prevent great variations in wealth without preventing people from getting rich  and you can t do that without preventing them from starting startups     So let s be clear about that  Eliminating great variations in wealth would mean eliminating startups  And that doesn t seem a wise move  Especially since it would only mean you eliminated startups in your own country  Ambitious people already move halfway around the world to further their careers  and startups can operate from anywhere nowadays  So if you made it impossible to get rich by creating wealth in your country  people who wanted to do that would just leave and do it somewhere else  Which would certainly get you a lower Gini coefficient  along with a lesson in being careful what you ask for    4      I think rising economic inequality is the inevitable fate of countries that don t choose something worse  We had a 40 year stretch in the middle of the 20th century that convinced some people otherwise  But as I explained in The Refragmentation  that was an anomaly a unique combination of circumstances that compressed American society not just economically but culturally too    5      And while some of the growth in economic inequality we ve seen since then has been due to bad behavior of various kinds  there has simultaneously been a huge increase in individuals  ability to create wealth  Startups are almost entirely a product of this period  And even within the startup world  there has been a qualitative change in the last 10 years  Technology has decreased the cost of starting a startup so much that founders now have the upper hand over investors  Founders get less diluted  and it is now common for them to retain board control as well  Both further increase economic inequality  the former because founders own more stock  and the latter because  as investors have learned  founders tend to be better at running their companies than investors     While the surface manifestations change  the underlying forces are very  very old  The acceleration of productivity we see in Silicon Valley has been happening for thousands of years  If you look at the history of stone tools  technology was already accelerating in the Mesolithic  The acceleration would have been too slow to perceive in one lifetime  Such is the nature of the leftmost part of an exponential curve  But it was the same curve     You do not want to design your society in a way that s incompatible with this curve  The evolution of technology is one of the most powerful forces in history     Louis Brandeis said  We may have democracy  or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few  but we can t have both   That sounds plausible  But if I have to choose between ignoring him and ignoring an exponential curve that has been operating for thousands of years  I ll bet on the curve  Ignoring any trend that has been operating for thousands of years is dangerous  But exponential growth especially tends to bite you     ___    If accelerating variation in productivity is always going to produce some baseline growth in economic inequality  it would be a good idea to spend some time thinking about that future  Can you have a healthy society with great variation in wealth  What would it look like     Notice how novel it feels to think about that  The public conversation so far has been exclusively about the need to decrease economic inequality  We ve barely given a thought to how to live with it     I m hopeful we ll be able to  Brandeis was a product of the Gilded Age  and things have changed since then  It s harder to hide wrongdoing now  And to get rich now you don t have to buy politicians the way railroad or oil magnates did    6   The great concentrations of wealth I see around me in Silicon Valley don t seem to be destroying democracy     There are lots of things wrong with the US that have economic inequality as a symptom  We should fix those things  In the process we may decrease economic inequality  But we can t start from the symptom and hope to fix the underlying causes    7      The most obvious is poverty  I m sure most of those who want to decrease economic inequality want to do it mainly to help the poor  not to hurt the rich    8   Indeed  a good number are merely being sloppy by speaking of decreasing economic inequality when what they mean is decreasing poverty  But this is a situation where it would be good to be precise about what we want  Poverty and economic inequality are not identical  When the city is turning off your water because you can t pay the bill  it doesn t make any difference what Larry Page s net worth is compared to yours  He might only be a few times richer than you  and it would still be just as much of a problem that your water was getting turned off     Closely related to poverty is lack of social mobility  I ve seen this myself  you don t have to grow up rich or even upper middle class to get rich as a startup founder  but few successful founders grew up desperately poor  But again  the problem here is not simply economic inequality  There is an enormous difference in wealth between the household Larry Page grew up in and that of a successful startup founder  but that didn t prevent him from joining their ranks  It s not economic inequality per se that s blocking social mobility  but some specific combination of things that go wrong when kids grow up sufficiently poor     One of the most important principles in Silicon Valley is that  you make what you measure   It means that if you pick some number to focus on  it will tend to improve  but that you have to choose the right number  because only the one you choose will improve  another that seems conceptually adjacent might not  For example  if you re a university president and you decide to focus on graduation rates  then you ll improve graduation rates  But only graduation rates  not how much students learn  Students could learn less  if to improve graduation rates you made classes easier     Economic inequality is sufficiently far from identical with the various problems that have it as a symptom that we ll probably only hit whichever of the two we aim at  If we aim at economic inequality  we won t fix these problems  So I say let s aim at the problems     For example  let s attack poverty  and if necessary damage wealth in the process  That s much more likely to work than attacking wealth in the hope that you will thereby fix poverty    9   And if there are people getting rich by tricking consumers or lobbying the government for anti competitive regulations or tax loopholes  then let s stop them  Not because it s causing economic inequality  but because it s stealing    10      If all you have is statistics  it seems like that s what you need to fix  But behind a broad statistical measure like economic inequality there are some things that are good and some that are bad  some that are historical trends with immense momentum and others that are random accidents  If we want to fix the world behind the statistics  we have to understand it  and focus our efforts where they ll do the most good                     Notes      1   Stiglitz  Joseph  The Price of Inequality  Norton  2012  p  32       2   Particularly since economic inequality is a matter of outliers  and outliers are disproportionately likely to have gotten where they are by ways that have little do with the sort of things economists usually think about  like wages and productivity  but rather by  say  ending up on the wrong side of the  War on Drugs        3   Determination is the most important factor in deciding between success and failure  which in startups tend to be sharply differentiated  But it takes more than determination to create one of the hugely successful startups  Though most founders start out excited about the idea of getting rich  purely mercenary founders will usually take one of the big acquisition offers most successful startups get on the way up  The founders who go on to the next stage tend to be driven by a sense of mission  They have the same attachment to their companies that an artist or writer has to their work  But it is very hard to predict at the outset which founders will do that  It s not simply a function of their initial attitude  Starting a company changes people       4   After reading a draft of this essay  Richard Florida told me how he had once talked to a group of Europeans  who said they wanted to make Europe more entrepreneurial and more like Silicon Valley  I said by definition this will give you more inequality  They thought I was insane they could not process it        5   Economic inequality has been decreasing globally  But this is mainly due to the erosion of the kleptocracies that formerly dominated all the poorer countries  Once the playing field is leveler politically  we ll see economic inequality start to rise again  The US is the bellwether  The situation we face here  the rest of the world will sooner or later       6   Some people still get rich by buying politicians  My point is that it s no longer a precondition       7   As well as problems that have economic inequality as a symptom  there are those that have it as a cause  But in most if not all  economic inequality is not the primary cause  There is usually some injustice that is allowing economic inequality to turn into other forms of inequality  and that injustice is what we need to fix  For example  the police in the US treat the poor worse than the rich  But the solution is not to make people richer  It s to make the police treat people more equitably  Otherwise they ll continue to maltreat people who are weak in other ways       8   Some who read this essay will say that I m clueless or even being deliberately misleading by focusing so much on the richer end of economic inequality that economic inequality is really about poverty  But that is exactly the point I m making  though sloppier language than I d use to make it  The real problem is poverty  not economic inequality  And if you conflate them you re aiming at the wrong target     Others will say I m clueless or being misleading by focusing on people who get rich by creating wealth that startups aren t the problem  but corrupt practices in finance  healthcare  and so on  Once again  that is exactly my point  The problem is not economic inequality  but those specific abuses     It s a strange task to write an essay about why something isn t the problem  but that s the situation you find yourself in when so many people mistakenly think it is       9   Particularly since many causes of poverty are only partially driven by people trying to make money from them  For example  America s abnormally high incarceration rate is a major cause of poverty  But although for profit prison companies and prison guard unions both spend a lot lobbying for harsh sentencing laws  they are not the original source of them       10   Incidentally  tax loopholes are definitely not a product of some power shift due to recent increases in economic inequality  The golden age of economic equality in the mid 20th century was also the golden age of tax avoidance  Indeed  it was so widespread and so effective that I m skeptical whether economic inequality was really so low then as we think  In a period when people are trying to hide wealth from the government  it will tend to be hidden from statistics too  One sign of the potential magnitude of the problem is the discrepancy between government receipts as a percentage of GDP  which have remained more or less constant during the entire period from the end of World War II to the present  and tax rates  which have varied dramatically     Thanks to Sam Altman  Tiffani Ashley Bell  Patrick Collison  Ron Conway  Richard Florida  Ben

72,training-dataset/business/890.txt,business,Why We Give Our Employees Paid Time Off to VolunteerBuffer retreats are special in many ways  Spending time together is probably the biggest benefit for our remote team   But as we travel to new locations  we also learn to view the world through new eyes  The more places we visit  the more we believe in this quote from Mark Twain    Travel is fatal to prejudice  bigotry  and narrow mindedness broad  wholesome  charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one s lifetime    Wherever we go  we try to visit with gratitude and leave the place better than we found it  In Cape Town  South Africa  that looked like donating to an organization that provides support and guidance for children and young people in South Africa  In New York City  it looked like spending some time at the Bowery Mission   During our last company retreat in Hawaii  we decided to take our efforts further and discussed a variety of ways Buffer could contribute on a wider scale  things like contribution matching  event sponsorship  a Buffer merchandise shop  and finally an employee volunteer program   Now we re excited to share the first step of these new efforts  A program to support our team members who choose to do good across the globe  Every employee at Buffer can take a full day or two half days off each quarter to show gratitude by volunteering or otherwise contributing to their community  wherever they may be  Here s more detail about the program   We discovered team members were volunteering regularly  Before we put a plan into place  we queried our team to see if teammates were volunteering or interested in volunteering  We discovered many Buffer team members already volunteer within their parts of the world in a variety of fields   Here are a few examples   Bonnie  Gratitude Champion  Currently Volunteering  Life Skills Mentor at Silver Lining Mentoring  very Buffery  Lots of biases were unpacked in training  forever grateful for that  with young people who are about to age out of foster care   Niel  Product Engineering Director  Currently Volunteering  Doing code mentorship every three months or so at Railsbridge Cape Town  Also involved in organizing Alterconf Cape Town this year   Roy  Pablo Customer Researcher  Currently Volunteering  Volunteer for Red Frogs Canada  a nonprofit that safeguards university and high school students  e g  hydration stations at pubs parties    Hailley  PR Crafter  Currently Volunteering  With a not for profit for about 4 years now called Girl Gone International  I organize events for expat women in San Francisco  I started the Ottawa chapter and then moved  and it feels amazing to help these women who are away from home connect with other like minded people and build up a network   Kelly  Happiness Hero  Currently Volunteering  At Philabundance  a food pantry in South Philadelphia  In the planning stages of starting a Girl Scout troop with some awesome folks at her coworking space   Many more shared dreams of volunteering in specific areas and causes that they hadn t quite been able to realize yet   This led us to wonder  What if Buffer supported these personal volunteer initiatives by providing an official program   Creating our Buffer Volunteers Program  Today  every Buffer team member has the opportunity to take one day or two half days per quarter to volunteer or serve in any capacity they d like   Part of this time off allows for logistics such as traveling and taking time to reflect and write about their experience   What can you do with this time  That s up to each individual   Here are a few examples we shared with the team   Working with an established non profit or other cause  Finding friends to walk along the beach or around the city  handing out cold water or picking up trash  Taking out a friend or acquaintance who has been having a rough time  Inviting local moms over for a day of pampering  Taking a friend  kids or family to visit a convalescent home and chatting with the folks there  Playing with the animals at an animal shelter  Taking a person who might need help to a doctor s appointment  An ongoing volunteer commitment  Anything else that shows gratitude and spreads positivity to the world around us   It s important to note  too  that no one on the team should feel pressured to volunteer or serve in any capacity  There s no judgment for any teammate s choice of service or if they choose not to take part in the program   How we log volunteer time  To take time off  team members chat with their leads to make sure their particular day off works for the team  Then they add it to our shared vacation Google Calendar and add the details to a shared document   Here s a peek at our template and one team member  Paul s  notes from his time volunteering at Innisfail Young Performer s Competition   Having this collective document helps us learn more about what everyone is up to and also allows others to peruse for volunteer ideas   It hasn t been used much yet  One interesting note is that this program definitely hasn t been used very much yet  which is something I m kind of sad about  although I haven t used it yet  either    Why aren t our folks taking advantage of this  I might ve missed something in its creation  or teammates don t feel like they have the time   Maybe they feel that taking the time off for volunteering will take away from time they feel they can take for vacation  Perhaps our new minimum vacation recommendations could help here   I d be really curious to hear if you have any thoughts about this or ways we can make the program easier to use or more encouraged   Get inspired by these cool volunteer programs   Buffer definitely isn t the first company to enact an employee volunteer program  These companies  and many others   inspired us in our journey   IBM has a robust employee volunteer program with over a century  wow   of experience  They provide their employees with a library of 40 different volunteer kits for teaching at schools and non profits  Their results  Over 9 million hours of volunteer service by over 140 000 employees and retirees   has a robust employee volunteer program with over a century  wow   of experience  They provide their employees with a library of 40 different volunteer kits for teaching at schools and non profits  Their results  Over 9 million hours of volunteer service by over 140 000 employees and retirees  Equally astounding is IBM s Corporate Service Corps  Ten to 15 IBM employees are invited every year or so on a service adventure for four weeks in another country to  work collaboratively with their government and community counterparts to understand how to implement socially responsible business practices with measurable results in a global context      In November 2010  Otterbox launched their very own non profit  OtterCares  aimed to inspire youth to become entrepreneurs and philanthropists  In addition to having the opportunity to participate in OtterCares created programs  such as Young Entrepreneur Tournament and Engineering Brightness  Otterbox employees are given 24 hours of paid time off per year to volunteer for OtterCares or beyond   Employee volunteer programs can look different from company to company as the office culture  work environment and location differ   What s really cool about volunteer programs is that they don t just create space for teammates to do great things in the world they also tend to make employees better at and more engaged with their work    Companies with the highest levels of employee  volunteer  engagement see more than a 19  average annual increase in their operating income Studies show that employees involved in company cause programs are 28  more likely to be proud of their company s values  and 36  more likely to feel a strong sense of loyalty  This  in turn  can lead to improved job performance and lower turnover     New York Cares  Over to you   If you might be thinking about volunteering or setting up a volunteer program  here are a few websites we found that might help find organized volunteer opportunities in your area   Volunteer Match  U S    Hands on Network  U S    Idealist  International   Volunteer Alliance  International   Go Abroad  International   Do you

83,training-dataset/business/1267.txt,business,How to Crush the Cold Email Game   Claire Fauquier   MediumHow to Crush the Cold Email Game  This is likely not a secret anymore  as I haven t been shy about sharing it  but I got my job here at Corigin Ventures through an original cold email to David Goldberg  email pasted below   In addition  I ve used many cold emails to network with fellow VCs  and feel no shame or fear in doing so   I have told many people before that I think there is real value in a cold email  so long as it s done well  I ve personally taken every meeting or call that s come in through a cold email  so long as I think they ve been thoughtful and put effort into it   With that  I ll lay out how I think a cold email can be written and executed upon well  and my major do s and don ts when it comes to sending them out   I want to caveat this by saying that the cold emails I m referring to pertain specifically to my field of work  which I define broadly as the tech VC industry  I have no idea how it should be done in other industries  although I could probably guess  I would feel comfortable giving people this advice for reaching out for jobs  both startup and VC  like myself   for networking connections  and for startups looking for funding   Strategy  I have two main points when it comes to the strategy around your cold email  If you don t take anything away from this post  remember these two points   1  The most important thing is to know who you re sending it to  This may seem obvious  but it s not executed very well in at least half of the instances that I ve seen  An impersonal  vague  bland email won t get you very far  Be as personal as can be  Look up the recipient on LinkedIn and refer to their past experience  or something they ve blogged on  Look up their portfolio  and identify some companies that are particular relevant to what you re doing  Look up their investment strategy and point out something you align with  Those are all examples  but are a bare minimum   2  Don t ask for something outright  Unless you have a specific ask that can be fulfilled with a quick note back  don t just blatantly ask for something from the person you re emailing  Chances are they re smart and will be able to read between the lines and know what you re getting at  but it s much easier to start a relationship with someone if you re not asking for something  In fact  to go one step further  try offering something   I ll use my job search as an example here  to explain those two points  I created a long list of VCs I wanted to get in touch with  and then tiered them  I reached out to each  bucket  separately  so I could be much more thoughtful on how I sent my emails  As a result  I made my emails personal and looked for something that could be unique for each investor  Then  and this goes more toward my recruiting technique   I didn t ask for jobs  I offered up some work and deep dives I d been doing in industries that were relevant  and asked if they d be interested in getting on the phone to discuss  plus tell me about their experiences   For founders looking for funding  I realize that you ll need to tell the VC that you re raising  and that sounds like asking for something  Mention your fundraise and what you re up to  but then suggest a call to discuss the dynamics around the industry and the trends you re seeing  plus the traction you re getting  to explore whether further discussions for funding may make sense  In essence  you re offering up your insider s point of view  and a way to be helpful  while they also know that you re seeking funding  It doesn t come across as transactional   more on this later   It s as many savvy investors suggest   go asking for advice and you ll get money  go asking for money and you ll get advice   I truly believe that if you re humble  helpful and earnest  you can use a cold email to your advantage   Structure  The best cold emails I ve seen play a fine balance between giving enough context so the reader knows the gist of what you re asking  while not boring with too many details or requests  In general  I like the following format  with about 1 2 sentences per section  1  Introduce yourself and lay out your intention  2  Loop back as to the relevancy of your cold email   i e  how you found this person  what you find relevant  why they were the ones you decided to email  etc   3  Explain your  ask   4  Provide further context to why it may be worth their time to chat  5  Mention logistics   i e  don t leave the reader hanging  If you re asking for a call  suggest times  but then mention that if those don t work  you can be flexible around their schedule  6  Thank them for their attention and sign off politely  By far the worst cold emails are short  impersonal blurbs  They often follow this format  Hi Claire  my name is  x  and my background is  y   I m looking to get into Venture Capital and would like to talk to you about your experiences  Please let me know if there s a time that works  Thanks a lot  Best   x,"[83 814 936 289 117 868 1063 931 1316 1390 154]"
84,training-dataset/product/13.txt,product,Val Head on interface animationAnimation is now a major part of most digital products  yet many designers remain under informed on the craft   Val Head is aiming to change that  A designer specializing in web and UI animation  Val is both a speaker and teacher  She curates the UI Animation Newsletter and recently wrote a comprehensive guidebook to her trade  Designing Interface Animation   It s available now through her publisher and Amazon  among others   I recently had a chat with Val about the fundamental differences in designing animation for web vs mobile  the importance of establishing motion guidelines for your brand  where designers can get started with animation  and more   If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes  Google Play  SoundCloud  or grab the RSS feed   What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the episode  Short on time  Here are five quick takeaways   Emmet Connolly  Val  thanks for joining us  Could you maybe just give us a quick rundown of your career trajectory  and in particular I suppose where you found your passion for animation   Val Head  I discovered animation in a strange place  I was taking an animation workshop in university  and the instructor showed us Flash  and we learned how to do Flash animation for six weeks  Right near the end  I got to this point where I thought   What if I wanted this animation to do one thing one time  and a different thing the other time  Do I have to make all of these frames and do it all by hand   They said   No  there s this thing called ActionScript  and you can write code to make things on the screen move around   That was a life changing moment for me   Emmet  I had a similar experience  I plowed many  many  many hours of my life into ActionScript  and I ll never have them back  but it is certainly a valuable base for thinking about motion in digital products   Val  I got into Flash work a lot  My first agency jobs were all doing Flash design  Oftentimes I was the weirdo web standards person in the Flash shop who thought we should actually make good websites as opposed to just show off  There s this tension in my career  where I really like love the creativity and the open world that Flash gave you  and the things you could do with it  but I also felt it wasn t playing nice with the web browsers  and maybe we should do something about that  I was that person fighting for the best of both worlds   We can now make animation that is of the web  not just on the web   Once Steve Jobs killed Flash and then web animation finally came into its own and became a real tool we could use  I was like   This is the best  This is exactly what I ve been waiting for  We can do animation  we can do it well  and we can make new things with it while also being truly part of the web   To steal a phrase Jeremy Keith   We can now make animation that is of the web  not just on the web   I think that s so amazing and so exciting that I just can t stop talking about it   Evolving beyond Flash  Emmet  Going back to Flash  it seems like it was a lot of people s introduction to animation on the web but seemed to be in many ways for its own sake  You had the typical Flash intro that was ubiquitous for a while  Today and motion and animation seem to be much more used as a solution to design problems  Do you feel like animation is entering a new phase  or is it still seen as an add on   Val  We ve realized that the skip intro era was not such a hot idea  which is good  Flash intros at their peak were pretty ridiculous  That s what Flash is remembered for  but people did some really beautiful interactions  and just lovely art directed sites with motion too  I m glad that we re going more towards that angle   We seem to have realized the skip intros were a terrible idea  and tried to find more of a utility for animation   really making it more of a proper citizen in our design toolbox  We re starting to think about it more like we do with type and color  where we want it to have meaning and fit  That s where we re going to get much more interesting and beautiful animation  Some of the best Flash work did that too  where it used animation  but in a way that wasn t like   Hey  watch our intro   because no one wants to do that   One of the big reasons it does get overlooked is just the fact that we have so little background in it as web designers  We think   Cool  We can animate stuff with CSS and things  Now what    A lot of times I see work where people are like   We should transition this   so they put a transition on it  and never consider it further  Really considering what it s doing  and why it looks the way it does   that s the key to pushing web animation forward and making  at least on the design side  things that are new and interesting and that will be unique to the web and the way the web works   Emmet  That somewhat na ve approach to animation that you described  you see that in other aspects of design too  You can see that applied to visual design  where trends and fashions come and go without really much thought being put into the why of it  Do you think that same thing around trendiness applies to animation  Are there certain things that are overused   Val  A big trend with animation right now is the whole idea of material design  and their motion guidelines  Material design has some really strong opinions on animation and how it should be used  Web designers are really drawn to that because it s often the first exposure they ve had to rules for designing animation   What gets lost a lot of the time is that Google wrote material design for branding Google things  When you use material design on things that aren t Google  you re kind of using Google s branding on a thing that is not Google  and that s weird  Material design is Google s opinion on motion  It s Google s branding opinion on motion  It s not a de facto standard of how motion should happen   Right now that s a trend because it s easy to find and easy to see  I m hoping that as we do more animation on the web  people will start moving away from material design for all of their motion decisions  and get comfortable having their own opinions on what makes good animation  and what makes good interactive animation   Emmet  It s like people are using the material design motion guidelines as an introduction to animation  rather than a specific instance of how motion branding should be done  Should people be creating their own motion brand guidelines  How do people even go about starting to approach a problem like that   Material design is Google s opinion on motion  It s not a de facto standard   Val  People should definitely be thinking about creating their own motion guidelines  That doesn t have to be a giant  huge  public beautiful thing like material design  It doesn t even have to be something you make or share  Any kind of documented consideration of animation can count as motion guidelines  Something you share with your team  like   Here are the values we have around animation  and what we want to do with animation   totally counts as motion guidelines   Every brand and every product has a point of view  It has a personality  It has something it s trying to say  It has something that makes it unique  That should be reflected in all the design efforts  including the animation used  That s how we create unique experiences  and not just remix what every other website has done before  Motion  when you consider it as an extension of your brand  and part of the overall design package  becomes a really great way to differentiate yourself  If that s what you want to use it for  you should definitely not just be copying material design  You should have your own opinions   Material design can be a great place to start  You could ask   Do I agree with Google   There s maybe things you don t agree with Google on  Good for you  Go with that  We need to have our own take on this stuff  It s hard when it s new to you  because you feel like you need permission to do that   Understanding tools and workflows  Emmet  It s interesting to talk about material design so much  because I actually worked on the Android team while material design was being put together  There was incredible work done  but one thing that really struck me at the time was the lack of really good tools to support that work   Something that was a real sticking point in the actual workflow of translating these ideas into real products was the tools that would bridge the gap between something like After Effects  and something that engineers could work with to actually implement those motion ideas  It just involved an awful lot of manual labor  Where are we at now in terms of toolkit  Are there any interesting resources that you re aware of   Val  It s great to hear that even the folks that even the folks that worked on material design had that problem  It s true  There aren t a lot of really good tools to get us from that visual timeline based animation and translating that to code  especially translating that into code that engineers would be happy to put in the final product  That s the extra edge there   This is why we are seeing so many new animation prototyping tools hit the market  I like to joke in workshops that there s a new one every day  That s only a slight exaggeration  We have Flinto  Pixate  Principle and Framer  I can t even list them all  All of that software is trying to fill that gap of   How do we make this transfer better   I m not sure anyone has got it right yet   If you re using something like After Effects  and you re handing off videos  it s really hard for engineers to look at a video and just magically figure out the timing  easing  and delays you ve used  It s really helpful to at least write that down somewhere  Write down what kind of easing curves you used  In After Effects  it would mostly be cubic B zier type curves  Actually giving that stuff to the person who s going to build it will make them much happier and save them a lot of time,"[84

86,training-dataset/product/1459.txt,product,What Starbucks can teach us about software scalabilityWritten by Weronika  abaj on April 07  2016   Comments  In 2004  Gregor Hohpe published his brilliant post  Starbucks Does Not Use Two Phase Commit   When I read it  my time working at Starbucks during my college years suddenly became relevant  Over the years  I gradually realized there s even more that programmers can learn from the popular coffee chain   Although many people may want to build scalable software  it can be much harder than it first appears  As we work on individual tasks  we can fall into a trap  believing all things are equally important  need the same resources  and happen synchronously in a predefined order   It turns out they don t at least not in scalable systems  and certainly not at Starbucks   How to make coffee  Preparing coffee at Starbucks is a four step process  First  customers stand in line  a queue  at the counter and place their orders  following the first in first served rule  Second  the employee  barista  takes an order from the customer and accepts the payment  Third  they start preparing the drink  Fourth  when it s ready  they place the drink on the counter and call out the customer s name   Although this may sound like a reasonable model  it can quickly lead to long lines  It s impossible for one person to do more than one thing at a time  so customers start queuing up while the barista works through each order sequentially  If they want to serve more customers  they need to scale  Let s look at ways they can do that   Scaling baristas  One way Starbucks can scale is to hire super baristas very talented  fast working  bright people  They d need to invest heavily in their development  optimize every aspect of their work  and constantly improve their efficiency  In software  such an approach would be called scaling up  vertical scaling    The problem with the scaling up strategy is that there s a limit to how fast  and how long  one person can work  At some point  even the super barista won t be able to meet the demand  When this happens  customers will leave the shop frustrated and may not come back   Similarly  there s a limit to how far we can optimize our software if everything runs sequentially  We just can t buy a 200GHz CPU  Even the biggest CPUs are multi core  with each core clocking at no more than 3 4GHz   Another way Starbucks can scale is to organize the work in a way that allows adding more normal workers  which is the essence of concurrent processing in software  After one barista takes an order  another can start preparing it  The first barista can then take another order while the first order is prepared in parallel   You might think that the best idea would be to consider concurrent processing only after the demand reaches a certain level  Unfortunately  it s not that simple  There s no magical switch that will allow us to turn on concurrency just when we need it  We need to prepare in advance   Starbucks knows that  When a new store opens  even if they have only one employee per shift  everything needed for concurrency is in place from day one  They are ready to add more people at any time   Lesson learned  We can t apply concurrent processing easily if we don t build our system in a way that supports it   Now let s look at how Starbucks accomplishes this   It starts with messaging  If you ve ever ordered coffee at Starbucks  you might have noticed little boxes on the cup filled with symbols  These symbols are a sort of shorthand used by the baristas to quickly identify the drink as well as any extras  e g   whipped cream  foam  etc     The cup  or message  is essential for communication between employees  It signals to the barista that a beverage needs to be created and the symbols written on it provide details on what kind of beverage to prepare  Even if the coffee shop isn t busy and there s only one person servicing customers up front  they will still add symbols to the cup   At first glance  this might seem like extra work  But if a large group of customers suddenly enters the shop  the other employees from the back can immediately jump in to help  Without the need for any additional communication overhead  they can start making drinks based on the messages   Lesson learned  Sudden spikes aren t problematic if we can easily add more workers anytime and divide the work among them  Using messages is one way to do that   Divide and conquer  As described earlier  the whole coffee making process can be covered by a single employee a barista  But the default setup at Starbucks is to have one employee  a cashier  taking orders and payments and another  a barista  making drinks   Usually  the slowest part of the process is preparing coffee  which is why multiple baristas prepare drinks when the shop gets busy  Often they ll take cups from the same pile and share the work evenly  This is an example of the Competing Consumers pattern   There can be scenarios  however  in which this approach runs into trouble  Let s say there are three baristas working with one coffee machine and one Frappuccino machine  Three customers order a coffee and the next one orders a Frappuccino  The person taking orders queues up four cups with the appropriate symbols on each  Each barista grabs a cup to make coffee  The first one starts making their drink and the other two are now blocked waiting for the coffee machine   We can avoid this contention for resources by dividing up the work  One way to do this is to separate messages into more fine grained types so that they can be handled differently  For example  we ve seen how Starbucks uses the cup as a message to indicate that a drink needs to be prepared  But the system also differentiates between hot and cold drinks  hot drinks are served in paper cups and cold ones in plastic cups  When we receive three orders for hot coffee followed by one for a Frappuccino  we now have three paper cups and one plastic one in two different piles  The first barista grabs the paper cup from the first pile and starts preparing the drink  The second barista  seeing the coffee machine is busy  grabs the plastic cup from the second pile and uses the Frappuccino machine instead  Now we have drinks from both piles being prepared in parallel   This kind of work division  in which baristas divide tasks and work in parallel  is called partitioning   Lesson learned  It turns out partitioning is a crucial element of an effective scaling strategy  Not all work needs the same level of scaling  Small tasks that are done fast can be done by a single worker while multiple workers take care of the more demanding  slower tasks  By using partitioning  we can scale each activity independently   Not all work is equally important  One of the things that makes Starbucks successful is that they ve trained their staff in the importance of recognizing the regulars  Take the guy who comes in every morning to get two venti americanos and two grande lattes to bring his team  Or the woman who every Wednesday orders a tall caramel macchiato and then stays in the shop for an hour to read her book   If a barista notices the  tall caramel macchiato woman  entering the shop on Wednesday  they will start preparing her favorite drink even before she comes to the counter  The customer gets a pleasant surprise when she never has to say what she wants  The cashier already knows her usual drink  so they only ask her how she s doing and take the payment  Before the payment is completed  her coffee is already waiting for her at the counter   You might be surprised how high a percentage of Starbucks  customers are regulars  Giving them the best possible experience is a high priority  Quite often  they end up getting their drinks faster than other customers  This makes them feel important and encourages them to come back  thus increasing their value to the company   Lesson learned  Some tasks are more important than others  By organizing standard activities into reusable  independent building blocks  we can easily modify the process to provide superior service for the more valuable tasks when the need arises   Not all mistakes are worth preventing  In all the examples above  Starbucks employees needed to verify that customers paid before receiving their coffee  To make sure that happens  baristas could ask customers to show their receipts before handing over a drink  But that s not how it actually works   What Starbucks discovered is that very few people try to get coffee without paying  Their analysis showed it s more profitable to keep baristas focused on fulfilling orders instead of preventing the occasional lost coffee  If someone happened to take the coffee you ordered  which usually only happens by mistake   the barista would prepare a new one for you  no questions asked   Lesson learned  To build scalable systems  we need to embrace the idea that some failures are inevitable  It s too expensive to try to prevent them completely  Instead we should focus on making sure we can detect issues quickly and compensate for them when they arise   Summary  What looked like a simple four step process for making coffee evolved into an interesting business process  What seemed exceptional and rare at first glance turned out to be an essential aspect of the business   Things like sudden spikes in demand or failures can happen multiple times per day  Designing a system that handles them well requires questioning common assumptions  Often the first model that comes to mind won t address such concerns  Also  there are many more exceptional situations to consider  For example  cancelling orders is an interesting problem all on its own   As the example of Starbucks shows  if we followed a na ve approach  our business would not be able to expand to serve a larger number of customers  Our service level would drop as we got more and more customers  to the point where they would stop coming  Instead  we need to organize our work in such a way that we can meet increasing demand  In the end  building systems that scale is just as much about rethinking our business processes as it is about technology   For more information about how to build scalable software  check out the following resources   About the author  Weronika  abaj is a developer at

91,training-dataset/business/1308.txt,business,Lessons in Tenacity from the Co Founder of FoursquareIn 2013  Foursquare co founder Dennis Crowley walked into a bakery and bought a cake  Almond  with meringue on top  It was sweet   but the milestone was sweeter   For more than a decade   since his grad school days   he d been pursuing one big idea  a product that understands how users move through the world so well  it can deliver timely  personalized tips  That idea had evolved through several iterations  from a startup called Dodgeball to the founding of Foursquare  When he bought the cake  the company best known for  checking in  was several years into something bigger  developing mobile software that would recognize users  locations and automatically push tailored recommendations   One of the developers gave Crowley a phone with a new build and told him to go for a walk with it  The Foursquare founder went down the street towards Little Cupcake Bakeshop  The phone lit up and pinged him to let him know he was near the bakery and what people like to get there  On the list  The Dreaming Princess Cake   It had worked  the phone knew where Crowley was and offered useful information  without any input from him  Needless to say  there was Dreaming Princess Cake for everyone in the office that afternoon   That game changing moment would be followed by a thousand mini breakthroughs  cutting the time it took for the phone to ping  for example  or better distinguishing between two neighboring stores   Those changes are harder to notice   says Crowley   The moment it goes from not working to working is the big moment    In this exclusive interview  he urges founders to think audaciously  and to push toward their own big moments  Crowley examines six facets to tenacity and how each can drive a company forward differently  He shares advice for how to pursue an idea for the long haul   and  as importantly  how to inspire and mobilize the rest of your team to care about it  too   Tenacity as Identity  The germ of tenacity can be as much about a great idea as one s self identification with it   Sometimes you just have to build it to prove to yourself that it works or doesn t  It s as much about if and why it works  as your agency in it   says Crowley   Take his first experiment  Dodgeball  The initial version was essentially just a city guide  wherein users could write reviews of places they d been  This was around 2000  the guide wasn t mobile  and crowdsourced content was still relatively unheard of  In fact  everyone in the space told him it couldn t work   editors were necessary for a reason   People said it s a bad idea   says Crowley   I lulled myself into thinking the same  It s not going to work  So we didn t build it    So what changed  Quite simply  this product was something Crowley himself wanted to use  The idea stuck in his mind  needling him  and he had to see if it could work   To build it was almost like fulfilling a need to express myself  So that was the project I learned how to code for  I taught myself out of one of those big  Learn to Code in 30 Days  books   he says   Personally  it was fulfilling  Externally  it wasn t a huge success  A couple of thousand people used it    But it laid the groundwork for Dodgeball Version 2 0  the prevailing version when Crowley founded a company by the same name in 2004   I was on the product and engineering team of Vindigo at the time  and we would say   Wouldn t it be crazy if you could see where all of your friends had been  You wouldn t have to read the reviews   you could just go to the places they d been     Again there were naysayers  and again Crowley knew he needed to see if it could be done the way he would do it   and if anyone else wanted to use it   I wanted this thing to exist  I thought   It doesn t seem like anyone else is going to build this  so I ll go build it     Around that time  as fate would have it  Crowley and several of his friends were laid off   We were trying to find each other around the city   he said  They had a need  and the time and skillset to meet it   We wanted a way that you could just check in at an East Village bar and that s how you would know to go find someone  Looking back the idea was there  we just needed a community to form around it    If  after several turns in your career and life  you return to the same idea  pursue it  Your creation is as much an act of self expression at that point   Dodgeball introduced the world to the concept of  checking in   and it turned out  lots of other people wanted it   I thought   If only ten of my friends use this  it s fine because it helped us   We found that if you can build something that you re interested in and your ten friends are really into  there s a good chance that their ten friends will be into it  and their friends as well   says Crowley   My lesson is that you ll need more than yourself eventually  but not much more  Don t give up until you can go after it with at least ten friends    Soon  more than ten friends became interested  Crowley teamed up with Alex Rainert at NYU  where he started to refine the idea  Dodgeball went from a side project to a full blown thesis  Google took note  too  and bought Dodgeball in 2005  A couple of years later  though  Crowley was itching to take his idea further   Tenacity as Confidence  Tempered With Humility   Even after achieving success   Dodgeball s sale to Google  Foursquare s buzzed about debut at 2009 s SXSW   Crowley encountered resistance   But one key ingredient of tenacity  Persistence   When we pitched Foursquare to investors  the feedback universally was  You already made this and you already sold it  Google ultimately didn t want it and it didn t work  Why would I ever invest in you doing the same thing again    recounts Crowley   Of course  it wasn t the same thing  In just a few years  phones had changed dramatically  as had the ways people engaged online and with their social networks  But just as you need to believe in your idea enough to build it  you need to believe enough to sell it   even if you yourself aren t sure where you re going to end up    We knew from Dodgeball that if we got a bunch of people checking in  there was really interesting trends at work in that data  We didn t know the full extent of what Foursquare would become years later  but we knew there was something buried in the data   says Crowley   And we know the idea of checking in  especially when combined with game mechanics  would get people to give us the data    Don t confuse confidence in your mission with hubris  though  There will still be expert outside voices who can see things you don t  When you find trustworthy counsel  listen to what they have to say   For Crowley  that came in the form of venture capitalist Charlie O Donnell  who was able to see the winning pitch for Foursquare before its founders could   We were out there describing how we would build a personalized guide to the world from all our data  As we were pitching  Charlie wrote a blog post called  Why Yelp   and Every Single Retail Establishment   Should Support Foursquare    With a little distance  O Donnell could see the story that investors and merchants would respond to   His was a very clear articulation of what Foursquare offers  It s this force that drives people to places  They check in  Merchants see that  and offer specials to encourage more check ins  There s an ecosystem there    Crowley and his team understood that ecosystem  of course  but couldn t take their eyes off the endgame   We were like   No  Personalized guide  Personalized guide   It took conversations with investors before we really realized what the story could be at that point  There was money to be made with merchants and with the data that helped them understand where consumers were going and what they liked  Once we started to understand the storyline that investors found compelling  we combined it with the narrative that we had crafted on our own  That s when it turned into something real    Dennis Crowley  Tenacity as Focus  In the commotion of launching a company  though  it can be hard to distinguish between wise voices and noise  between the ideas that move you forward and the ones that sidetrack you   Crowley s advice to founders is to articulate   and then frequently check in with   their North Star  How to do that   Keep asking   What s this supposed to be when it grows up    he says   We ve always had an orienting grand vision  sometimes to a fault  build products that generate information about where people are going and use that data to create products that make it easier for them to navigate the real world    But there was a moment  Crowley now recalls  when he and his cofounders thought they should perhaps pivot to being  the check in to everything company   It was 2010  and new imitators were cropping up every day  applying Foursquare s concept to anything from events to meals   There was this whole movement  you ll check into TV shows and check into articles  We laugh at it now  but we thought   Should we do that     Crowley and his team kept their eye on their North Star and avoided deviating down that and any number of other distracting paths   You have to ask yourself   Is what we re supposed to be in ten years  Are these the products that we re destined to create ten years from now   You have to have a clear opinion of what you re doing or what you re not doing  You have to trust your gut sometimes and say   This keeps us on the path more than this would     Staying on the right path is not simply about making major decisions thoughtfully  it s not a once a year agenda item for the company offsite   It s a series of decisions that get made every day   says Crowley   That s because new factors in the form of data  market shifts  competitors  advisors   you name it   change the set of information you use to make decisions at any one point in time  The only way to keep focus is to continue to ask yourself  what s this supposed to be when it grows up  You ll either explain or rationalize your answer  That ll help guide you    Up until 2013  for example  Foursquare gave its API away for free  even to the Fortune 500 companies who were using it   then an investor pointed out that that was crazy   We thought people would switch to something else if we charged for it  It turns out when we started calling up the companies that were using the API most aggressively  they said   Of course we re going to pay for this  We re actually wondering why you didn t call us six months ago asking to be paid     The team put together the requisite pricing plans and sales strategies and began selling their API  And in so doing  their eyes were opened to a world of new data products they could develop  In fact  in recent years  Foursquare has dedicated growing resources to enterprise sales of those products   But how can you tell the difference between a distraction from your mission and a pivot that will enhance it  It all comes back to the crucial guidance of that North Star   We always said   Build the stuff that makes the real world easier to use    says Crowley   If you ve chosen the right mission   if  crucially  it s something that excites you your own reaction to new ideas will be telling    Admittedly  these were tough decisions for Crowley back then  The signals in the industry told him Foursquare should be big and be competitive  Almost weekly  he had conversations like this   Crowley   I m the founder and I don t want to do that    Someone else   But  that s what everyone else is doing    Crowley   I don t care  I don t want to do that    In hindsight  Crowley can laugh about it and say it was such an easy decision  But it wasn t  It was taxing   There will always be distractions  big and small  As a founder  your responsibility is to stay mission focused   I think about those early Facebook stories  They had so much success  and so many distractions   Yahoo  trying to buy them for a billion dollars  The response from Mark Zuckerberg from that time is something like   I don t think I m ever going to have an idea this good again   That  I think  sums it up    Tenacity as Grit  It s unlikely that bringing your big idea to the world will happen overnight  and having a mission you believe in will only become more important when you hit the inevitable slogs  Reflecting on his own decade long journey  Crowley identified a few key principles that will help founders endure for the long haul   Don t wait for someone else to build it  A lot of startups begin with a good idea that no one else has run with yet  That kind of initiative should remain a part of your company s DNA  long after your seed round recedes into company history  And don t be afraid to punch above your weight   For years  Crowley had imagined technology that would know where a user had been without being told  Once someone delivered that  he thought  he d make even better  smarter services  Until that day  Foursquare s app would just use manual check ins as a workaround    In 2011  we were waiting for other companies  Google and Apple  to build that technology  It would be able to tell you  the developer  or tell your app where it was  which store or restaurant it was in  I thought that was going to be baked into the iPhone 4S with iOS 5  Those were the signals that we were getting from Apple with all the geo fencing that they were launching   says Crowley   I remember we watched the keynote  We got the phone and we played with it  And we said   This doesn t do what it s supposed to do     That moment was an epiphany for Crowley  You can t wait for another company to make the technology you need to build what you re destined to build  You must develop it yourself   From that day  Crowley and his team set about learning how to develop the platform they needed to move forward on their revenue generating plans  It took years   There were moments when our board would say   This thing doesn t work  Is it ever going to work  We invested a lot of money into getting this thing working  When will it work   And the answer was   I don t know   It was a harder problem than anyone thought it was  It required more engineers and data scientists  which we didn t have before  There was nothing for us to copy  We were building it from scratch    What he didn t tell the board was that he wasn t always sure it was ever going to work   You know what the end goal is  You know the stakes are high  and that there s good reward for doing it   says Crowley   That s the thing that keeps you doing it    But that s the thing about tenacity  sometimes you have to make the big bet  say it out loud  then throw yourself in so there s no going back   Foursquare s technology embodies tenacity  even down to the name  The company called its location technology Pilgrim  to represent how important   nearly sacred   this mission was for the company  and how persistent it must be in its journey toward it   When we announced Pilgrim  I took a look back at all we accomplished  Personally it had been eight years working on Foursquare and more than a dozen immersed in location based or contextual aware services   says Crowley   That s even before you get to the efforts of hundreds of people at Foursquare  But that s what it takes to build something   like our Places API or Pilgrim SDK   that can help thousands of developers or marketers  Tenacity over time has an exponential   not a linear   impact  But it takes dedication    Tenacity as a Culture  At the end of the day  tenacity needs to transcend the founder and become a core company value  Big ideas aren t brought to fruition single handedly  Just as you ll devote your time to scaling operations  you need to scale tenacity  too   Talk about setbacks openly and honestly  Make it a habit to share the good and the bad   It s really hard  but you can create a cadence  At an All Hands or weekly check in  show two slides every week  One slide is about what s good  one slide is about what s bad   Build this into your process   says Crowley   Whatever the format  the goal is simply to ensure that the people building and selling your products understand what s going on with the company  Overemphasizing the positive becomes problematic  Some companies are just drinking their own Kool Aid all the time  That s not helpful for anyone  You have to have a regular dosage of good news and bad news for self awareness    Seed a culture of ingenuity  You developed your foundational idea with grit and focus  As you grow  you ll need to elevate lofty thinking as a company value and reward those who practice it  and you ll increase tenacity exponentially    We have infused the company with that same shoot for the moon spirit that started it  Now  a lot of the things that generate revenue for the company aren t my ideas  Someone pitched an advertising product that was loosely tied to Pilgrim  something that would help advertisers measure ad effectiveness  Another said we could predict the number of iPhone 6s that d be sold based on foot traffic data   says Crowley   Those were not my ideas  They re crazy   Has anyone ever done that   No   Why don t you go do it   All right   What do you need   We ll get a couple of people to go work on it   Go do that and let me know how it works out   That turns into a huge part of what we re doing    How  though  can you stay focused when lots of fresh minds are generating lots of fresh ideas  Ask yourself whether any new idea leverages your core idea  If it does  trust in it  even if it seems outlandish  That s how you honor the spirit of risk taking that got you to where you are  without getting distracted   If your core idea is your North Star  go ahead and build a constellation around it  Just avoid adding stars that ll shine alone in another galaxy they rarely get as bright   Tenacity as a Private Truth  Casual observers probably don t know that the Foursquare team has been defining itself as a location intelligence company  indeed  many have kept judging the company by its consumer apps  usage metrics   These days  we all know that we are creating a location tech company  built on the amazing work we do on the consumer side  But plenty of people on the outside world are like   I don t use your app anymore  therefore your company must be failing    says Crowley   Sometimes people tell me they don t use the Foursquare app anymore and to that I say   Hey not a problem   we have more than 50 million people around the world who do   I think there s also a lot of people who touch Foursquare data everyday   through our partnerships with Snapchat  Uber  Twitter or Apple Maps   without even knowing it  The company is performing well these days because of all the technology we ve built on top of all the data we have    As a founder  you will likely find yourself  from time to time  sitting on business data or strategy that you can t yet share  That s not to say you shouldn t speak up when you can  Foursquare  for example  has been engaged in a significant campaign to educate people outside the company about its current priorities   In the first three or four years of a company  though  you re not doing that   says Crowley   The press is telling your story  the users are telling your story  Maybe you get on stage at a conference occasionally and talk about the great stuff that you re building    Then there are the even more frustrating middle years  That s when you re likely to be building the bigger  better things that will allow you to scale  And if you re like most companies  there are sure to be stretches when your killer new technology isn t working the way you wanted   or is still just a glimmer in your eye   That s the moment  Crowley says  to double down and stay true to your big idea  You might not be sending out press releases  but there s one audience you can and should be talking to  your team   Answer every question that they might have about your product  Repeat what you re doing every week at the company meeting  Remind each other  Explain how you define success  and reinforce that internally  The world might not need to understand what you re up to yet  but they sure do    Tying it Together  Tenacity has many manifestations for founders and their startups  At the beginning  it s often deeply tied to identity  Giving up one s idea feels like giving up on oneself  After hitting early milestones  tenacity is confidence  But it s best tempered with humility  so as to avoid flying too high on early wins  As a company scales  tenacity is focus  There will be accompanying growing pains as customers sign up  headcount grows and the market responds  Anchor and orient yourself by asking  what is this supposed to be when it grows up  When the going gets tough  tenacity is grit  Don t look externally to others to build what you need   you ll be waiting longer than you want  Do it yourself  Lastly  tenacity is culture and a private truth  Tenacity at scale will both involve and elude people  What guides the team isn t always accurately reflected in the public s perception  An informed  committed team around you is the best way to drown out the noise and to march toward achieving your biggest goals    These different facets of tenacity are important insofar as invoking them keeps your legs moving and charging forward  Growing a company is an impossibly hard endeavor   many wouldn t start if they knew just how difficult it is   Crowley says   But the early stories of most successful companies are often those in which no one thought it could be done  In fact  if you asked them  those founders probably didn t know if they could do it either  But if you can get there   if you stick to what you set out to do   it can put you in an amazingly powerful and defensible position    Photographs by Benjamin Kulo and Monograph s Daniel Agee,"[91 561 1316 51 154 1145 1390 612 863 721 609]"
95,training-dataset/product/1210.txt,product,Seven Simple Steps to Stress Free Prioritisation72 Flares 72 Flares    Job stories  backlog items  workshop ideas  roadmap features  it s easy to feel overwhelmed by the scale of potential directions you can take a product in  And it s natural to want order in this chaos  Prioritisation is a core part of Product Management  and it s the topic I most commonly get asked about by other Product Managers  But it can also cause a lot of stress   while prioritisation is important  too much emphasis is put on it   I think you should keep the prioritisation process fast and flexible  This frees you up to focus on other crucial parts of your role  like gaining insights and actually delivering   Part of the problem with prioritisation is the assumption that a  correct  order exists in the first place  and the myriad of prioritisation methods available feeds this myth  It implies that once you discover the perfect sequence of priorities you will magically arrive at a reliable and predictable roadmap for your product  Unfortunately reality is not so kind  Here are a couple of uncomfortable truths about prioritisation   A lot of the time prioritisation is based on hunches and guestimates  You ll probably only do one or two items from your beautifully manicured list before it changes  Take the Impact Effort Matrix as an example  It falsely assumes we know in advance the specific value of each item and the time it will take to implement each of them  However  how can we know the impact that something will have before we put it in front of customers  And how many times has a project taken longer  or even shorter  than expected to deliver   Underlying the prioritisation questions of  what order is best  and  which are the most important ones   is the aim of discovering  what s the fastest way I can reach my objective   I think therefore you should put the focus on learning and rapid experimentation to quickly find the best path   Story Awareness Set  Instead of an ordered list I prefer to imagine a pool of potential job stories and hypotheses  the Story Awareness Set  The more insights a story has to back it up  the nearer to the top it floats  As you learn more about your domain certain stories tend to bubble up  When you re ready to start developing the next story just pick any of the ones near the surface  This allows you to be very flexible and agile   Express each idea in the Story Awareness Set as a combination of a Job Story and Hypothesis   When  situation context   I want to  motivation   so I can  outcome    Based on  quantitative qualitative insight   we predict that  product change  will cause  impact    This captures the situation the user is in  their motivation  their desired outcome  the change you re proposing to address their need  and the predicted impact  Fundamental to this are the insights underpinning it  which is why they are explicitly stated at the beginning  Crucially we aren t asserting a speculative impact upfront  Instead we re making a hypothesis after interpreting observed qualitative and quantitative insights  Framing the hypothesis like this is also an important first step in designing a rigorous  trustworthy A B experiment to test your prediction  The more you understand about the story  the more confident you can be in its value  If there are no obvious insights it is less of a hypothesis and more of an assumption  That s OK  but it s important to recognise the difference and make sure you re testing assumptions in the smallest way possible to reduce their risk   Seven Simple Steps to Stress Free Prioritisation  Product management is beautifully messy and full of delightful uncertainty  Don t let prioritisation suck the life out of it  Here are some steps to make prioritisation feel second nature   1  Accept you can t do everything  That s OK  no one can   2  Embrace the uncertainty  There is no perfect order  and that s fantastic  We can be a lot more responsive now   3  Pick an item and start working on it  It doesn t matter which  go with your gut  It s more important to do something and learn quickly from it rather than agonise over what to do  Put the focus on  what s the most you can you learn in 24 hours  It may seem counter intuitive but getting something rudimentary in front of your customers will actually make it easier to prioritise the larger story   4  Ask probing  incisive questions about the other items in your Story Awareness Set  What problem will it solve  What will we learn from it  What questions will it answer  What will it tell us about our direction and strategy  What key assumptions will it address  How will we measure and evaluate it  And so on   5  Identify insights for the items in your Story Awareness Set  Have you seen people struggle with this in usability testing  Is it raised a lot in Jobs to be Done interviews  Have you identified patterns or unexplained behaviour in your analytics data  Did a previous experiment highlight an unmet need or challenge existing assumptions  The more qualitative and quantitative insights you have to back up the item  the more you ll understand its value   6  Talk to your engineers and designers  Avoid asking them for estimates of time or effort  The answer is just a number  It won t help you gain a deeper understanding  Instead ask questions to expose potential risks and identify known unknowns  Is it worth doing a technical spike  a small  time boxed investigation into a specific technical issue   Would more targeted user research or basic prototype testing give us a clearer direction  What are the potential technical  system or product complexities they can they foresee   7  Start the next item and repeat  There should now be some clear candidates to pick up next  The ones whose backgrounds feel more fleshed out and are on more solid ground   Keep thinking about the rest of the items in your Story Awareness Set  As you learn you ll continue to see them in a different light and you ll get smarter about which tasks to pick up next,"[95 987 232 1314 590 561 1152 154 288 925 1316]"
97,training-dataset/business/560.txt,business,One Thing You Cannot PivotWhat s in a name  When it comes to the name of your company  the answer is  a whole lot  In this excerpt from his book How to Launch a Brand  Fabian Geyrhalter walks readers through the various things to consider when naming your company  explaining how different types of names can either serve the company or pose challenges   The name of your new brand quite possibly your organization s greatest asset will usually be with you forever  It will become the launch pad from which all the other elements of your brand will spring  including potential sub brands in the future  It sets the tone for your organization or product  Once a name has been selected and implemented  it is an expensive and disruptive undertaking to go through the process of changing that name  which is why it is so important to get it right the first time   To find the perfect brand name for your product or company  you can either hire a professional or try the do it yourself method  With the right blend of talent  creativity  and perseverance  you may be able to come up with that clever name you ve been seeking  However  what might seem like an easy task at the outset can quickly become incredibly challenging  Constraints such as finding a unique name with an available  com domain that can be trademarked will limit choices and force you to expand your imagination possibly beyond your time and creative capabilities   8 Rules for Naming Your Startup  When selecting the best name for your company or product  you should look for certain characteristics   1  Short and Easy to Pronounce  Aim for a name with three syllables or less  Test the pronunciation of your name by pretending to answer the phone how does it sound and feel  Is it easy to say  and does it sound established and trustworthy   2  Meets Your Needs Online  Many of the top brands in the world own their domain names outright  While this is an ideal vision  your brand s flexibility with  com ownership depends on the type of business you are creating and how heavily you will rely on your website  Rule of thumb  If you want to launch as a brand  you should own the  com domain in order to  walk the walk    3  Passes the Search Test  Do a Google search on your desired name to make sure it doesn t appear in similar or related products  Reviewing results of the first two or three pages should be sufficient to help you catch any red flags  your new brand will quickly infiltrate the first pages on Google anyway  This test will also help you weed out names that are already legally trademarked   4  Tells a Story  When people ask you what your company or product name means  and they will   make sure it comes with a good story to back it up  There is so much competition in the marketplace  and consumers are seeking more than just a product they are seeking to connect with your brand on an emotional level  The story behind your name can become a large part of that connection   5  Stands Out  but Not Too Far  from Your Competitors  Product or Company Names  Selecting a name that allows you to stand out from other companies and products in your vertical will allow you to gain your consumers  attention  Be careful  though  not to choose a name so distinctively different that it no longer feels associated with your industry  or you ll run the risk that your target audience won t be able to quickly connect with it   6  Expandable into Brand Language  Think of Twitter and how it has made clever use of its name by creating a whole culture with its very own nomenclature comments are dubbed  tweets  and the world of Twitter is known as the  Twittersphere   This aspect of a name may not be applicable to your specific product or company launch  but it can be a nice bonus and may be able to evolve organically over time   7  Avoids Clich s or Overused Words  Within your particular industry or vertical  there are likely a number of words that many companies have used in their names  For example  if you re launching a new line of cosmetics  you would be wise to avoid using the word  or any derivation of the word   beauty  in your product line  This overused term has become pass  over time  Using a clich d word can make your product feel dated before it even hits the shelves  also making it more difficult to be found via online searches   8  Culturally Friendly  A key factor for brands that will reach a global audience  and most brands will through their various social media outlets  is that the brand name should resonate across cultures  Make sure you ve researched the breadth of meanings and connotations your chosen name might carry   Click the image below for a full infographic on how to name your company   How to Come up with a Company Name  Now that you are well versed in the ingredients involved in selecting a great company name  let s take a look at the various types of names available  In her book Designing Brand Identity  author Alina Wheeler identifies six major categories for types of brand names  founder  descriptive  fabricated  metaphor  acronym  and creative spelling  Wheeler  2013   Adding to this list  we ve included a category for numeric names as well  Below  we will explore each of these categories further and weigh the pros and cons of each of these types of brand names   Founder  Companies or products named for their founders tend to lean toward the more conservative side  Examples include Johnson   Johnson and the Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation   Pros  Recognition or legacy associated with the name can allow your brand to have an instant following among those already familiar with the founder  It will likely be quite easy to obtain a trademark on a brand name based on its founder  The chances of another brand in your industry having the same name are slim  unless  of course  the founder name is very common  such as  John Smith    Cons  As in the case of Martha Stewart and Lance Armstrong  when a product or company is linked to a well known name  any press that follows that person will follow your brand  Be sure you are ready to weather any storm with a fearless PR agency in tow  and having an exit strategy in place for if the founder leaves the namesake company   Descriptive  As the category implies  some brand names evoke precisely what they do  as in the case of Match com  Kickstarter  YouTube  and Petco   Pros   This type of name quickly conveys your purpose to your consumer  which can translate to fewer marketing dollars spent on educating your target audience   Cons  With the quickly diminishing list of available  com domain names  finding a descriptive name for your company can be especially challenging  Additionally  there may be numerous other companies within your vertical that have either the same or a very similar name  which can make it very difficult to trademark and stand out  Relying on a specific feature of your company too much for your name poses a threat as your startup s core offerings change over time  An example mentioned earlier  the company YouSendIt faced this exact dilemma when they had to rename their company to Hightail because they had expanded their product line to offer more than just file sending   Fabricated  These names consist of a made up word or a combination of words that create something new  Examples include Accenture  which was derived from  Accent on the Future  and Xobni  which is  inbox  spelled backwards   Pros   Fabricated names can lead to some of the strongest branding for a product or company  Consider Kleenex and Xerox  both names have become synonymous with their products  This type of names can be the easiest to trademark simply because they tend to be unique   Cons  A fabricated name is unlikely to communicate immediately to the consumer what your company or product is about  It will require a larger marketing effort and budget to educate your target audience   Metaphor  These names describe the nature of a company through reference to people  places  things  or foreign words  Puma  a popular brand of athletic wear  uses the metaphor of a fast  agile animal to communicate its brand   Pros  Metaphorical names can serve as a creative way to convey your brand without being overly obvious  They help you avoid those clich s and overused terms discussed earlier in the  Characteristics of a Great Name  section   Cons  Misleading connotations can cause confusion and allow your brand to slip into oblivion unless you have the correct marketing effort to educate your audience  these can also be more difficult to find in online searches  Names that reference common words can be quite difficult to trademark because there may be many other products or companies within your industry that have already used that term in the naming of their brand   Acronym  These names form a new word or words based on acronyms that carry a message relatable to the new brand  AOL is derived from  America On Line  and Asics is an acronym for  anima sana in corpore sano   which  translated from Latin  means  healthy soul in a healthy body    Pros   With names that cannot be read as a word  such as AOL  shorter acronym names can allow your company to quickly sound like a well established large brand  Similar to descriptive company names  if your acronym spells out a unique name  as in the example of Asics  obtaining a trademark shouldn t be problematic   Cons  Depending on the length of the acronym  it can be very difficult to obtain an available  com domain  particularly in the case of three or four letter names  In addition  you will need to expend additional marketing effort to ensure that your audience won t jumble or confuse the letters of your brand name   Creative Spelling  These names alter the spelling of a relatively common word  as exemplified in the names of brands such as Svpply  a product aggregation site  and Lyft  a ride sharing service  Names such as Svpply and Lyft tend to appeal to a younger demographic   Pros   It can be an easy way to obtain a domain with the name you want   Cons  Consumers will likely misspell your company name in web searches if they ve heard it only mentioned verbally  Or they may be unsure as how to pronounce it if they ve only seen it written  and therefore might be less inclined to repeat it to a friend  Even if other brands in your vertical spell their name somewhat differently  you might have a hard time obtaining a trademark on this type of name if the United States Patent and Trademark Office  USPTO  deems that it can cause confusion  This naming strategy can often be seen as lazy   Numeric  This category comprises names that consist only of a number or that combine a word with a number to convey a unique story about their brand  For example  the household cleaner Formula 409  more commonly referred to as just  409   got its name through perseverance   After creating and testing 408 different formula versions  two young scientists in Detroit developed the winning blend we use today  source  formula409 com    Pros  Creating a story between a word and a number can make for a memorable name  Combining a common word with a number that tells a distinct story about your company or product can also make it easier to secure a domain and trademark   Cons   It might be difficult to secure a domain if the name only has 3 4 numbers  Longer numeric names can be difficult for your audience to remember   4 Key Takeaways  Most startups change their core business model as they grow  especially in the first 6 12 months after launch  In the case of an ill advised naming strategy  the name also has to change   Ideas  processes  offerings  designs  and teams will all likely adapt over time  but your name will stay with you forever   Ensure that you own the rights to your chosen brand name  purchase the domain  get the social media channels  and trademark the name   Ensure that the name already tells a story or can be easily used to create a new story   This excerpt is taken from Fabian Geyrhalter s book  How to Launch a Brand   now available

117,training-dataset/business/1451.txt,business,Here s How To Do It RightQuick links  WARNING  This article will drastically improve your outreach skills   Tim  your post about outreach had a massive impact on the amount of links we were getting  It was something like 7 10 links for every 100 emails sent  Now its like 7 10 links for every 50  or so  emails sent  People s responses were totally different too  in a good way   I ve since hired someone to do email outreach completely based on your post  Works b e a u tifully   I hope you read that in Jim Carry s voice     Keith Bresee ValconMedia  The profession of an  online marketer  requires us to do lot of so called  outreach    We reach out to let others know about our content  ask for a backlink or simply make a connection   But there s one more group of people who do lots of  outreach    SPAMmers   So where s the red line between the two  And which camp would you put yourself into   Trivia  Outreach or Spam   Here s an email I got the other day   What would you call it  Outreach or SPAM   Please leave your vote before you read any further  It would be fun if there are two opinions to it   Is this outreach or spam  outreach  spam View Results  Loading   Loading    As for me  I deleted it without reading  It s not that hard to notice a template   Hey  I just found your post  http   post1 It links to this post  http   post2 I have a similar post  http   post3 Please link to me too   Yeah  sure   Delete     Outreach  is not  Broadcasting   You just published a new article on your blog and now you re going to send a mass email to 100  top people in your niche with an excuse   I saw you tweeted a similar post    I m sorry to say this  but your article is not welcome in their inbox   Otherwise  they would probably already be signed up to your email list   And besides  it s just disrespectful to mass email top people in your niche with some generic  outreach template    The more famous a person is  the more of these outreach templates he gets in his inbox daily   That s why you should divide your list of prospects into four groups and treat each group differently   1  Sharks  These are the people with a huge audience and notable achievements  think Gary Vaynerchuck  Malcolm Gladwell  Tim Ferriss  etc     They don t have time to read emails from strangers  so your only chance to reach them is by a personal introduction or by doing something really creative and outstanding   It will take a ton of work  and probably luck  to get on their radar  but these people can send hundreds of customers your way with just a single tweet  So the outcome is well worth the effort   2  Big Fish  These people are not as famous as the Sharks  but their audience is big enough to make an impact on your own business  think Noah Kagan  Nathan Barry  Glen Allsopp  etc     There s a good chance to reach them with a nice personal email  but never with a template   Asking Big Fish for tweets and links is unproductive  and silly   you will get much more value by asking them to critique your work or validate your ideas   And if what you re doing is worth attention  they will tweet it and link to it anyways   3  Small fish  These people don t have a big audience yet  Their websites are only starting to get traction and they are actively promoting themselves by contributing to niche communities  writing guest articles and participating in all sorts of events   They are your ideal outreach targets   4  Spawn  They are just starting out in your industry and they will most likely reply to your outreach email even if it s 100  templated   But it doesn t really make much sense to reach out to them  They don t have any traffic to send your way  and a link from their website is hardly worth anything because it s so new   TIP Ahrefs   Domain Rating  metric helps you understand the  power  of a website  based on its backlink profile  As a general rule  links from high DR websites carry more weight than links from low DR websites  Read more here   As you have probably guessed  you should focus your outreach efforts on two groups   Small fish  and  Big fish    And what follows is the process that Ahrefs  marketing team uses to reach out to these people and get replies like this one   1  Use the correct email address  This first tip may seem like a total no brainer  but give me a chance to explain   Too many people rely on some automated tools to scrape  or sometimes even guess  their outreach prospects  email addresses instead of investing a bit of time to research a person manually and find his actual email   For example  my own email address is listed on our team page for everyone to see  timsoulo ahrefs com  But some people prefer to send their emails to a non existent tim ahrefs com  which are picked up by our catchall   I ignore these emails in 99  of cases   The fact that a person didn t bother to find my real email tells me he s not that interested in getting in touch with me  So I m not interested in replying either   If you need a good process of finding email addresses  check out our recent article   9 Actionable Ways To Find Anyone s Email Address    2  Think what s in it for them  You want a link  you want a tweet  you want to be featured in front of their audience  But what will THEY get out of it   If you don t provide value and only ask them to do something for you  your success rate is going to be extremely low   Here s how you can make your outreach about them   Show them something new   valuable  If you have something truly unique and outstanding  influencers might appreciate a heads up   And besides  people with large audience need a constant flow of awesome content to cater to their fans  so they will be grateful if you show them something of value   But let s face it  Sharks and Big Fish are super hard to impress  The stuff that seems unique and outstanding to you might easily be old school for them   Research your topic well before contacting top people in your field and be realistic about the novelty and uniqueness of your offering   Once you define what makes your content unique  make sure to clearly articulate it in your email so you can pique their interest   Here s an example of my own outreach email   I didn t just say   Check out my amazing research of guest blogging   I actually explained what I did there and shared a few quick takeaways from my article   This helps the recipient evaluate whether your content is worth checking out and reduces the chances you ll waste their time on an article they view as only  average    Feature them  It s incredibly hard to resist checking out a piece of content when you know it talks about you  So why not use this to your advantage   Remember that a person s name is  to that person  the sweetest and most important sound in any language Dale Carnegie  If you see a way to feature a well known person  or their business  in your article  do it and let them know about it   This can be anything really   A quote from their article  podcast or talk  Some feedback about the things you ve learned from them  A positive experience with their product  service or company  If you make them look good  they ll want to tell their audience about it   3  Only use your best work  We have 300  articles on the Ahrefs Blog and most of them are very good  but we only do outreach for a handful of the very best ones  most of them are featured on our blog homepage    This aligns with the tip that I just shared above   Show them something new   cool    You only have one chance to make a good first impression on the top people in your industry  Do you really want to blow it by sending them your  average  article  I hope not   But the reality is  most people think every article they publish is a masterpiece  That s why influencers  mailboxes are flooded with content that s anything but special   So how do you make sure your outstanding article won t get buried in that pile of  average    Provide social proof  Is there anything about your article that would prove you re not the only person who thinks it s cool   Did it generate 100  comments   Did it get tons of upvotes on Reddit   Did someone famous tweet it   Did you get cited by authority website in your niche   Anything along these lines will make your outreach email stand out massively   Take a look at my example   Try to get some initial traction with your article and then use it as your social proof when reaching out to people   4  Re think your outreach excuse  Here are the 3 most common excuses that I see people use for outreach   You tweeted this post  and I wrote a similar one   You published this post  and I wrote a similar one   You linked to this post  and I wrote a similar one   Why would anyone want to check out a post that s similar to what they just read    Similar article  is a very poor excuse  and it shows you didn t study the person you re reaching out to   A decent excuse would look like this   You tweeted this post  and I thought you d be interested in checking out a different opinion on that topic  In a nutshell it s all about XXX and you can read about it here   You wrote this post  but you didn t mention one very important aspect  I m talking about XXX and I ve explained it in this article   You linked to this post  and I thought I should show you a much better resource on that subject  It s better because XXX   I m pretty sure the difference is clear   But to come up with an excuse like that  you ll have to actually skim through the post they wrote linked to tweeted and figure out how your own article is different from it   Most people never bother to study their outreach prospects  and this is how they find themselves featured as bad outreach examples   Reading every article before you reach out and figuring a proper excuse for outreach might sound like a ton of work   But that s only the case when your article isn t unique enough   Let me explain what I mean with an example   In our recent article  we called out SEO professionals for popularising a wrong definition for the term  long tail keywords  and shared the right one   Guess what kind of excuse we re using in our outreach template for that article   Hey  First Name   I noticed that you ve mentioned a concept of  long tail keywords  in your recent post about  post topic   Here at Ahrefs we believe that the definition of the term  long tail keywords  in 2017 needs to be revisited  As well as the actual strategy of getting traffic from them  Please check out our recent post for more details  https   ahrefs com blog long tail keywords  Given that you have a lot of experience in the SEO field  it would be interesting to know what you think about it  Thanks in advance   In other words  if your content is offering something really unique  it won t be too hard to craft a good outreach excuse   5  Throw away your outreach templates  As you can probably tell by now  there s no way to scale your outreach while maintaining the quality   It s too easy for your recipients to see when your email is automated and therefore ignore it   I have no hard feelings when I throw automated outreach emails into the trash can  I know hundreds of other people have received the exact same email and most of them didn t bother to reply   Don t get me wrong  I m not advocating against templates there s no way to email 100  people about the same thing and write your email from scratch every time   I m only trying to say you should spend more time crafting a template that doesn t look like one and leave some room for personalization   Here are a few tips to consider   Don t use generic subject lines  Let s go back to the subject of the email I shared above   Subject  Hi Tim  Compliment on one of your posts  Doesn t this look sleazy right off the bat  I didn t open the email yet  but I m already sceptical   My favourite approach to email subjects is to keep them short and not too obvious   Example   Subject  ahrefs link building advice  You can clearly tell that this subject has something to do with link building and Ahrefs   But what exactly   Is there some problem with their backlink profile   Am I offering them some link building advice   Am I asking them for link building advice   You ll never know until you open the email and learn that I am asking you to check out our amazing Noob Friendly Guide To Link Building   Avoid patterns  When people use outreach automation software  they often follow an easy to distinguish pattern   It usually goes like this   Hey  First_Name   I just came across your article   URL_of_their_article  It s an amazing piece of content and I learned a lot from it  I noticed that you linked to this post   URL_where_they_link_to  It s a great post  but I wrote an even better article on that same topic  Check it out here   URL_of_my_article  I hope you can add a link to my post in your article or at least tweet it  Thanks   Whenever I see an email structured in a similar manner  I realize that there s some automation in place  which gives me the moral right to ignore it   Here s an example of a template we use at Ahrefs   Hey  First_Name   I just stumbled upon your article about  what their article is about   Try to say something smart about their article  feedback  compliments  jokes  etc  I figured you might be interested in checking out our  Ahrefs   Noob Guide  to link building  https   ahrefs com blog link building  Obviously you re not a noob  and it is unlikely that you ll find anything groundbreaking there  But I m pretty sure that you get some  noob  questions about link building now and then  so perhaps you ll find our guide good enough to share it with these people  instead of trying to explain everything on your own  In this guide we have featured all the major link building strategies and even did an industry survey to figure out which were the most popular and most effective ones  Oh  and if you think our guide is lacking something   we ll be happy to revise it  So yeah  looking forward to your feedback  And thanks in advance   Tim  That is still a template  but it leaves room for a lot of personalization and it doesn t follow any obvious pattern   Other than this one   Mention which article of theirs made you reach out  Give feedback about that article  if any   Plug your own article  Explain what makes your article unique and why they should care to check it out  Ask for feedback   If you follow this pattern  you will create a unique outreach template for every new piece of content   And if you ask me  I wouldn t dare to delete an outreach email like this one  Quit stupid flattery  Everyone loves to be praised  right  That is why every outreach template that you ll find will start with a few words of praise   And it s usually ugly as hell   I just read your article and it is very cool   I m a long time reader of your blog and I think your content is totally amazing   Thanks for posting your outstanding article about  topic   I ve learned a lot from it   You should never use this kind of templated flattery in your outreach emails   Either say something meaningful  or don t say anything   Here are some good examples   I loved your advice on doing XXX  I m totally going to implement it this month   Your story of XXX is totally inspiring  I ve just shared it with couple of my friends   Your take on XXX totally rocks  I never thought of it this way   That  XXX  part was highlighted for a reason  By adding context  you show them that your flattery is not templated  but you actually took time to study their work   Nick Churick is pretty good at that   6  Show them you know them  If you take time to dig a little to learn more about the person you re reaching out to  your chances of getting a response from them will go through the roof   I mean  if you cared to spend your time learning about me and you showed it in your outreach email  I d feel like a total ass if I didn t reply   Look again at the email example I shared earlier   I knew that Jimmy was a fan of epic guides  because he recently published an  epic guide to email marketing   And this allowed me to send him a personalized outreach email   7  Timing is your friend  Just because someone wrote an article about something a few years ago  it doesn t mean they still care about it today   And there s almost no chance you can get them to update that old article and link to you   But the opposite is also true   If the article was published just yesterday  its author is an easy outreach target   Here s a screenshot that shows how Brian Dean updated his newly published article with 22 more tools  shortly after it was posted to Inbound org   That s because he got a ton of outreach emails with tool suggestions immediately after publishing his article   Do you think you can make him add your tool to the list if you email him now   The chances are very slim   He has already moved on to something else and won t get back to that article anytime soon   PRO TIP Use Ahrefs Alerts to track when people publish articles on your topic  or link to your competitors  and reach out immediately   8  Ask wisely  Asking for favours is an art  But most people never give it a second thought and act as if everyone owes them something   Here are a couple of rules we follow at Ahrefs when reaching out to people   Don t ask for tweets  It s obvious  that you re reaching out because you want some exposure for your piece  You know it and your recipient knows it too   But as soon as you ask for it directly  two things happen   Your email is no longer about giving value to them  It s about asking for a favour to you  If they don t want to tweet your article  you re putting them in a difficult situation   I hate to tell people   No  I won t tweet your article   I d rather not reply their email at all   But if I like your content  I will tweet it  even if you didn t ask me to   Ask for links  Unlike with tweets  people do require a soft nudge if you want them to link to you   But you have to make sure you re giving them an easy way out  in case they don t want to do it   Just frame your request like this   Let me know what you think about the post  Maybe it s worth mentioning in your article  or in future ones    Would love to know your opinion on that article  And if you ll find it useful  please consider linking to it from that post of yours  or perhaps mentioning it in your future writing   You re still clearly asking for a link  but you re making your request easy to ignore  if a person doesn t want to do it   9  Follow up  once  Quite often people don t respond  not because they don t want to but because they forgot to   This can be solved with a short polite follow up   Hey  First_Name   Just a quick follow up in case you ve missed my email  If you re short on time right now   no worries  I won t bug you about it again  Thanks   Tim  That s it   Please don t send more follow ups   Seriously   Don t be that guy   Level up your outreach game  I sincerely hope this article makes you reconsider your outreach strategies   Don t shoot yourself in the foot  Be genuine and provide real value to the person you re reaching out to   There s a human like you on the other side of the screen  Always remember that   And should you get a bad outreach email in your inbox  just reply to them with a link to this post,"[117 814 584 936 931 1063 83 868 154 1279 1316]"

continually surprises me is the open and transparent culture  Giving feedback and experimenting with the process is all part of the journey   Over my time at Buffer  I ve had the fortunate experience of working on a few  startups within a startup  fostered within our product lineup   including Respond  our recently acquired social media customer support tool   When we first acquired Respond  our CEO Joel had some heady goals to get its interface  Buffer ized   squash a ton of bugs and turn the whole thing around   in just a few weeks  time  A team of incredibly talented people was working flat out to get this project out  for customers to enjoy  as soon as possible   Buffer  like my previous employer  SoundCloud  is primarily in the  scaleup  mode of operation  rather than  startup   At SoundCloud  I was used to taking time on the tiniest of details and then pushing to have those designs engineered in a pixel perfect manner   Many designers work like this  which I believe is a logical way of working  But the startup journey of Respond was about to teach me a valuable lesson about speed  action and perfection that would completely change my approach to design   Ready for the overhaul  I remember that period for many reasons   I had recently moved back from Berlin  I was staying at my mother in law s spare bedroom with my wife  One Sunday evening I was enjoying a beer  or two  when Joel hit me up on Facebook saying he needed a hand on a new and exciting project  Boom  I was to redesign the Respond interface and only had a few weeks to do it   I m always up for a challenge  and so  with my beer goggles firmly on  I said   Let s do this    So I set about working on this project in the same way I had for years  I looked deeply at what we currently had  listened to all the data and feedback  made sure we understood what the problems were  had a good think  opened up the design program Sketch  and dove in   Feeling like this was an opportunity for a real overhaul  I went deep and proposed to the team that  Let s change a ton in one go    It had to be perfect or did it   The longer I spent with my designs  the further into the details I got   while all the while  more demands were mounting on our team  I felt this had to be perfect  I mean  why would this not be anything but perfect for our customers   This was the grand unveiling of a whole new world for Buffer  and so I insisted that to succeed  the designs had to be implemented just right  this padding had to be correct  that image had to be just so  and what about those colors over there  So many details  such little time  literally  But I had quickly forgotten one of the major cornerstones of the Lean Startup world    The lesson of the MVP is that any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste  no matter how important it might have seemed at the time     Eric Ries  That s what Respond was at the time   an MVP that needed to be done in weeks  not months  We needed to get it out the door fast to start learning from customers  Anything beyond that goal was entirely surplus   Things were going well  but I had started to bring in an extra level of anxiety and stress by pushing for pixel perfect translations of the design   I was driving for extra work where it was frankly not required  I was claiming that these designs needed to be implemented  perfectly  to ensure customer success  Which  when building an MVP  is the furthest thing from the truth   The feedback that changed everything  This resulted in Sunil  Buffer s CTO who was helping out on Respond at the time  sending me this email  everyone at Buffer automatically sees any emails being sent out  it s part of our culture of transparency     Hi  James  It s been really great getting this opportunity to work with you on Respond and I know how much has been on your plate working in two different areas and then also having to focus while moving back to the UK and taking care of your wife  I m so glad to hear your wife is doing better    I m super inspired with how you ve been able to balance things  I wanted to quickly mention that I ve been reflecting about this week with Respond and the standups and how we ve all gotten on the same page to improve respond iteratively instead of trying to achieve perfection on the first try  To me it did feel like there was a lot of pressure both on you and on the team to make things perfect on the first try or launch  I think you ve mentioned a couple times in the standup how we want to the designs to  perfect   That does make a lot of sense  however I d love to point out how at Buffer we try to steer away from focusing on perfection  and instead  focus on a bias towards immediate action and learning much faster  I just wanted to share that when I heard the word  perfection  in the standup  it did catch me quite a bit by surprise  because I think I realized later  we really haven t valued striving for perfection at Buffer  Instead what we do is strive for action because we know  perfection  will never be attainable  and certainly not on the first try   Through small  easily achievable and positive improvements  we ll converge on perfection     To me that also feels more elegant and working smarter not harder because it s a lot of pressure to put on everyone if we value perfection over action    Lean vs perfect  This open and honest feedback is an amazing aspect of Buffer s culture that always surprises me  even after a year  Sharing ways for others to improve or calling out things that aren t feeling quite right is still really refreshing to me   I had read a lot about the Lean Startup movement over the years  and I thought I understood what MVP really meant  But this feedback from Sunil really made me stand up and take notice   Of course I had design standards I wanted to uphold  but there were aspects of my process that didn t make sense in an early startup environment that required a more agile approach  With some adjustments  I could really step up my game   Four ways to undo perfectionism  As a result of this feedback  I started making some big changes in the way I approached design for Respond   Break a big task into smaller pieces  I began to look at my design process in a much more modular way  I started to approach solutions that could easily be broken down into smaller chunks  so could be achieved in a much smaller amount of time with a high level of quality  This is much like an engineer would separate out their code into smaller functions or modules   Share early to avoid a  big reveal   I started to open up the design process more and get engineers in those earlier design discussions  Getting technical feedback is great  but it s also humbling to understand what the bandwidth is and those modular solutions will bend to that  Also  getting the whole team on the same wavelength early removes that  big reveal  and everyone can already start to thinking how to implement from a much early stage   Communicate more than you think you need to  I started to do away with a formal design hand off document and relied more on early communication  interactive prototypes  using tools like InVision  and async discussions over tools like Dropbox Paper  though others like Google Docs works just fine    Wear more than one hat  I came from an engineering background  a long time ago   and so I got back to it  taking on a little coding and using it as part of my quality assurance  There are many debates around if designers should code or not and I do believe that learning just enough to help with styling can be a really powerful thing  Rather than explaining minute changes with margin  paddings or font sizes  you can just roll up your sleeves and get them done   Conclusion  Does perfection even exist   As a designer  I always want things to look and feel great  But SaaS products  and digital products on the whole  rarely work like that  There is always a bug to fix or a better way to do something   Perfection  it could be argued  doesn t really exist   That s not to say that quality should be the first to go in a project like a startup  I think it s less about perfection and more about what level of quality can this particular project  invest    With an early startup fighting for its life  as long as things look and feel  good enough  then it s probably good to go  When you need to get your first customers through the door  worrying excessively about margin sizes isn t going to help   A  scale up  business with more time might be able to  invest  more in quality   The key is knowing what s expected and then adjusting your process to accommodate the needs of the project and the team   I m grateful to have gotten the experience and feedback to be able to discover when good enough is truly good enough  It s made my design more efficient and impactful  and it s a lesson I ll carry with me   Over to you  Do you ever struggle with perfectionism  How do you cope or work around it  We d love to hear from you in the comments,"[125 1025 421 1073 1174 609 1145 684 51 1316 561]"
130,training-dataset/business/624.txt,business,Steve Blank The 11 Bad Habits Killing Innovation in Your CompanyPosted on by steveblank  Alexander Osterwalder invented the Business Model Canvas  co founded strategyzer com and was the lead author of Business Model Generation which sold a million copies in 30 languages   Alexander and I often collaborate on new ideas for corporate innovation  Here s his guest post on what bad habits to avoid inside of a company   Big companies have great execution habits to manage and improve successful business models and value propositions  But the habits that foster execution can easily kill new growth initiatives inside your company   Bad Habit  1  The current business model dominates the agenda  In most companies the future suffers at the expense of the present  Companies are great at improving their existing business model and value propositions  but fall short when it comes to inventing entirely new business models  value propositions  and growth engines  In fact  by the time a company realizes it needs to reinvent itself for future success  it s often too late  This happens because managing the present often takes oxygen away from inventing the future  Rita McGrath  a Columbia Business School professor says   there s pleasing today s customers and there s developing tomorrow s business   You need to be excellent at both   Remedy  Create a protected space in your org chart where you invent and test new business models and value propositions  Equip this  space  with power and prestige  Become an ambidextrous organization   one that is excellent at managing and improving your existing business  alongside inventing new ones   Bad Habit  2  One size fits all decision making hurts speed   inventiveness  Companies that grow in size and scale proven products and services can quickly fall into a trap of slowness  unthoughtful risk aversion  and failure to experiment  As Jeff Bezos puts it  one size fits all decision making  hurts speed and inventiveness  inside large organizations  In fact  Bezos constantly adjusts Amazon s culture to ensure that the company never slows down and loses its entrepreneurial and nimble approach to finding future business success   Remedy  Amazon distinguishes between non reversible decisions with substantial sunk costs  like e g  investing in a new warehouse in Amazon s case   and reversible decisions like experimenting with a new offer  The former requires slow and careful decision making  The latter requires speed and agility   Bad Habit  3  Insisting on untested and detailed business plans  Most established companies require detailed business plans for new ideas  This results in carefully crafted and thought through documents with detailed spreadsheets and a great focus on how an idea will be implemented  However  the first goal of an innovator should not be to think hard about an idea and describe its implementation  First and foremost  an innovator s job should be to rapidly  cheaply  and continuously test and adapt ideas until there s enough evidence from the field to prove they will work  Only the latter helps avoiding big flops because it systematically reduces the risk and uncertainty of new ideas  Business plans actually maximize the risk of failure because of the focus on executing an unproven idea rather than testing it   Remedy  Use business plans only for execution of existing businesses  Don t ask innovators for business plans  Instead  implement processes that force innovators to systematically prototype and test ideas  reduce risk and uncertainty  and ultimately provide the evidence that an idea will work and is worth doing   Bad Habit  4  Opinions matter more than evidence  Senior leaders acquire a lot of knowledge and experience about their business over the course of their career  Unfortunately  this knowledge may be irrelevant when it comes to new value propositions and new business models  For example  the knowledge that Kodak s leaders acquired during their successful decades in analog film didn t equip them for digital photography  Quite the contrary  The rules to compete in the digital age are completely different  That s why it s so important for companies to  get out of the building  and interact with customers  Steve Blank  father of the Lean Startup movement  stresses that you will never know enough about your customers if you are holed up inside a boardroom  A good idea might still be a bad idea because customers don t care about it  Michael Schrage  a research fellow at MIT  emphasizes that  a testable idea is better than a good idea    Remedy  Educate leaders that judging ideas for new value propositions  business models  and growth engines requires evidence from the field rather than just  expert opinion  from leadership  Implement processes that judge ideas based not on how they look  but based on the evidence from the field that support them   Bad Habit  5  Outsourcing customer discovery and testing  Large companies have a habit of hiring outside agencies to do market research and customer discovery  That s dangerous when it comes to developing new value propositions  business models  and growth engines  You can t hire outside professionals to test and learn from customer interactions and make decisions for you  New ideas require many rapid iterations between prototyping  immediately testing with customers  and then deciding how to adapt your idea based on the acquired insights   Remedy  For radically new ideas you should defer hiring outside agencies until you ve found product market fit  Instead  roll up your sleeves and internalize the hard work of rapid prototyping  testing  learning  and deciding  Third parties can help you with the process  but they can t do the work for you   Bad Habit  6  Senior leadership too busy for hands on innovation  Senior leaders are very busy and time pressed people  Typically  they see the  getting out of the building  to test ideas with customers as a task to be performed by subordinates  But leaders have to be more than just sponsors of new business ideas  Decision makers are the ones who can make things happen  They are the ones who need to feel the market and talk to  potential  customers to learn that some of their initial assumptions or strong opinions might be completely wrong  Equipped with these market insights they can help move things faster   Remedy  Distinguish between senior leaders who manage the present like running factories  and senior leaders who are involved in creating the future and need to  get out of the building    Bad Habit  7  Obsessing about competitors rather than customers  Unfortunately  many companies are more obsessed by their competition than their customers  Your customers are far more important than your competitors  Your  potential new  customers can tell you how to beat your competitors  Customer have the evidence your organization needs to validate or invalidate new business ideas and potential growth engines  That doesn t mean you should completely ignore the competition  After all  business models and value propositions aren t designed in a vacuum  However  competitors should not be your primary focus  As Steve Blank says   You can t drive forward by looking in the rear view mirror    Remedy  Obsess over your customers first when developing and testing new value propositions  business models  and growth engines  Then  evaluate how these new ideas perform in the competitive landscape   Bad Habit  8  Focus on technology risk at the expense of other risks  New business ideas face many different risks  The California design firm IDEO distinguishes between three types of risk when they assess prototypes  desirability  feasibility  viability  Desirability is about the risk of your customers not being attracted by your new value proposition  Feasibility is about technology and infrastructure risks  Viability is about financial risks  We added a fourth risk  adaptability  Adaptability is about the risk of a business model and value proposition not being fit for evolving external factors  like competition  technology change  or regulation  risk  external threats    Remedy  Make sure you test all four types of risks  desirability  feasibility  viability  and adaptability   Bad Habit  9  Innovation is career limiting  In many companies being an innovator is not an attractive career path  First  in most organizations any type of failure is seen as a negative for your career  Yet good innovation processes require rapid experimentation and failure to gain insights  adapt  and ultimately succeed  Second  corporate incentives are geared to rewarding execution  where failure is not an option  Third  in most companies  innovation is still seen as a department for pirates and  the crazy ones  who really add no value to revenue and profit  And finally  prestige in companies is measured by who commands the largest budget and staff  But great innovation programs always start small   Remedy   Create different incentive systems for the people focused on execution  and the people focused on innovation  Make innovation a prestigious job in your company  After all  the innovators are ensuring your organization s survival in an age of constant change   Bad Habit  10  Innovation is siloed from Execution  Companies struggle to get the  execution engine  and  innovation engine  to collaborate  rather than to compete  Rather than realizing that managing the present and inventing the future are equally important and should be equally resourced  they often fight for the same resources  Often the execution engine deprives the innovators from access to valuable resources like customers  brand  or skills  That means the innovators end up competing without any competitive advantage against the more nimble and agile startups   Remedy  Create a culture where executors and innovators collaborate because they understand each other s value to the organization  Create processes and incentives that grant innovators access to customers  brands  and skills so they can outcompete the more nimble and agile startup ventures   Bad Habit  11  Integrating new ideas into the execution engine too quickly  New ideas are fragile and they need to be carefully nurtured and scaled before they are integrated into the execution engine with its rigid processes  key performance indicators rules  and procedures  If you integrate new ideas before they fully mature you might kill them  For example  Nespresso  the successful daughter company of Nestl   only survived and thrived because they were physically distant from Nestl  s headquarters   Remedy  Protect new ideas until they fully mature  for example  like in Nestl  s case  by locating the project outside of the company s headquarters   Join Alex Osterwalder at the Business Model Canvas Masterclass in San

will become your new normal   If there s one thing we have learned over seven years at the Founder Institute  with over 2000 companies launched  it is this   In order to power through the hard times of entrepreneurship  money cannot be a founder s main source of motivation   As Elon Musk once famously said   Being an entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of death   Only the most passionate founders will survive   As a result  in the Founder Institute s application process  we don t require that applicants share their startup ideas with us  we focus on founders more than companies   However  one question that we do ask  and that we do take very seriously  is this   Why do you want to be an entrepreneur   This is one of our favorite questions to ask  because if you don t have a good reason  why  you are building a company  you will never have a good  what   For example  if you don t have a good  why   you will have a very hard time surviving the challenges  developing a strong vision for the business  and pitching the business to potential team members  customers  and investors  It will be easy for people to see that your  heart  is not in the company

152,training-dataset/product/149.txt,product,Start recruiting participants  day 1 The GV research sprint  Start recruiting participants  day 1   At Google Ventures  we have a four day process for answering questions and testing assumptions without the time or expense of launching  We call it a GV research sprint  This is the second in a series of five articles on running your own research sprint   You can also watch a 90 minute video about research sprints    Research sprint checklist     Create a recruiting screener    Post recruiting screener where the right people will see it    Select and schedule participants    Start creating interview guide    Confirm participants    Complete interview guide    Review prototype with your team    Set up test devices and recording system    Interview five customers     Summarize findings and plan next steps with your team  Today you re going to start the process of finding customers to interview  It s not as hard as you might think  Most of the time  it s as simple as posting an ad on Craigslist and screening applicants with a simple questionnaire  I ll show you how to do it the easy way   and I ll also explain how to do it when things get tricky   Set a tight deadline  The first step is picking a day for your interviews   yes  even before you ve finished the prototype or know exactly what you re going to test   One secret benefit of research sprints is that the deadline is very motivating to your team    Find a day when the team will be available to watch  It s important that the core team  designers  engineers  and PMs  observe the interviews and talk about what they learned  so find a day when everyone s available and block it off on their calendars   Your interview day   day 4  in this series  should be at least three business days from now  It takes a few days to recruit  so don t wait until you needed the research done yesterday  And try to avoid Mondays and days right before or after holidays  participants  and teammates  are less likely to show up   Talk to the right people  To get the most bang for your buck  you ll need to define and select the participants you want   and explicitly screen out the ones that won t provide you helpful feedback  While getting feedback from your friends and family is better than nothing  sometimes   you ll quickly see that reactions from  real  users will be much more eye opening   When I interviewed coffee drinkers and tested prototypes for Blue Bottle Coffee  I needed feedback from foodies who drink specialty coffee and had ordered coffee online  If I had found out during an interview that any of my participants drank only decaf  or owned a cafe  or didn t brew their own coffee  those interviews would have been a bust   That s just one example  Every scenario calls for a different recruiting approach  for example   Test a getting started experience with people from the target audience who haven t used your product   Test engagement or activation with users who signed up but don t actively use your product   Test task completion or usability with people who use  or would use  the feature you are designing   This is a critical step in the process   one that many teams overlook  Take the time to seriously consider which research participants will help you answer your questions before you start recruiting   Step 1  Create a screener questionnaire  To find the right people for your interviews  you ll need a screener questionnaire  Every potential participant fills it out  and you can sort through the responses until you find five people that fit the bill  Here s how to create the questionnaire   Define your criteria  With your team  list the characteristics of the people you want to interview  Then figure out precise criteria you can use to identify those people   To recruit  coffee drinking foodies  for Blue Bottle Coffee  we identified precise  measurable criteria I could use to screen prospective participants  they drink at least one cup of coffee per day  they read food related blogs and magazines  they eat at restaurants at least once per week  etc   In addition to specifying the users you want to talk to  brainstorm characters you don t want to see in your interviews  You ll probably want to exclude folks who are under 18 years old  work for competitors  or are unusually technical  including engineers  designers  and product managers   For Blue Bottle Coffee  we excluded people who roast their own beans  don t enjoy a variety of coffees  or drink coffee infrequently   Use this worksheet for writing a screener  Write screener questions  Next  write questions for every one of your criteria  Like any good survey  it s important to write questions that don t reveal the  right  answers   some people will try to game the survey so they can get your  75 incentive  For example  rather than asking people whether they go to restaurants and read food blogs  I asked   In a typical week  how many times do you eat out   Do you regularly read blogs or magazines dedicated to any of the following topics     Sports    Food    News    Coffee    Cocktails    Parenting    Gardening    Cars  Create a form that people can fill out  After you ve written questions for all of your criteria  create your screener questionnaire  I always use Google Forms   it s easy to set up  and the responses go right into a Google spreadsheet that I can sort and filter  more on that later    Tip  Include a multiple choice question that lists available time slots  This will save you a lot of back and forth emailing to schedule participants  I usually schedule five 60 minute interviews  at 9 30am  11am  1pm  2 30pm  and 4pm   Look at this example research screener form  Step 2  Get people to fill out your screener  Now that you ve created a screener questionnaire  you ll need lots of people to fill it out   that gives you a good shot at finding five that fit your criteria  You can hire a recruiting vendor  but I recommend doing it yourself because it s cheaper  gives you more control  and allows you to complete recruiting in just a few days  Once you have a screener questionnaire  DIY recruiting is as simple as posting a link where the right kinds of people will see it   Craigslist  If you re recruiting  normal people  who aren t familiar with your company  you can probably find them on Craigslist  Just post an ad in Craigslist s  Et cetera jobs  section with a link to the screener    100 usability interviews on 5 29  Kirkland   I m scheduling 60 minute usability interviews in Kirkland on Thursday  May 29  Selected participants who complete the interviews will receive  100 Amazon gift cards  Please complete this short questionnaire   Participants will     Be willing to sign our standard confidentiality agreement     Allow us to record the session     Not require an assistive device or software to use a computer   Look at a sample Craigslist ad  Finding friendlies  If you want to interview people who are interested in your company  or at least familiar   you can post a link to the screener on Twitter  Facebook  or anywhere else you have an audience  You can also add a small link   Want to give us more feedback    to your product  website  or company emails   Experts and hard to find participants  When recruiting very specific and hard to find types of users  you ll need to get creative   Check with your sales or business development teams to see if they have lists of potential customers  leads   partners  or contacts they can share  I ve used this approach to recruit medical specialists  small business owners  job candidates  and many others   You can also look for contacts in professional associations  community groups  student groups  or your personal network  For example  when I needed to interview restaurant managers  I got in touch with the membership director of my local restaurant association   No matter where you look for contacts  be sure to share the link to your screener questionnaire and make sure that all potential participants fill out the form  This is the best way to make sure you won t waste time interviewing the wrong people   For

154,training-dataset/product/1406.txt,product,Lessons learned in growing a productFrom the moment your beta app lands on Product Hunt you ll ask yourself what way it should grow  Should we add more features on more platforms  or better features on one platform  Should we capture the complete user s workflow  or excel at just one piece  These questions are core  and no one but you can answer them  For most startups  advice means limited experience and overgeneralizations  So when I spoke at Business of Software last year  I focused only on what we ve learned to be true in our journey from 0 to  then  8 000 customers  as well as the lessons invariant across many companies  rather than extracting from a data point of one  Hope it s useful   When I worked as a consultant in Ireland  I worked for government websites and library websites  And then I started a consultancy with some other folks and we built web products for startups  That gave me a lot of raw experience with the binary outcomes of startup  Four or five products we worked on went on to have multimillion dollar acquisitions  The rest netted out to zero  That s typical of how startups play out  Since then  we built a product  sold a product  and then built Intercom  the business we re all in on today  A lot of what I ve learned has been about product  I firmly believe that you can mess most things up  if you get product really right  Conversely  you can have perfect financials  perfect accounting  and beautiful marketing  but if your product is terrible  you get found out  Reality really bats last  So  rather than talk about Intercom as it is today  and how our company s structured  we re gonna talk a little bit more about what we learned when Intercom was a small  embryonic idea that we were trying to turn into a big business  And the first common trait I see across startups  that ones that make it and don t  is they differ on this  Your vision is the ceiling for your success If you want to build the world s fastest time tracking software  you ll build the world s fastest time tracking software  And that s exactly what you ll do  But you won t necessarily transform how businesses are conducted  or even how time is tracked for that matter  Visions are really  really important  They re the guiding principle for your entire company  I really like this scene from Alice in Wonderland   Because if you don t know what you re trying to achieve  all roads are equal  Either equally optimal or equally terrible  But you don t really care because you don t actually have a sense of the grand destiny you re going for  Without having a vision  you ll flip flop frequently cause you don t actually know what you re trying to do  It s easy to sort of talk about vision in a really high level way  that s best visualized in PowerPoint Clipart  When I m talking to companies  I never actually ask what your vision is  I ask specific questions that I think are indicative of how you see the world  Like what does the future of your domain look like  What are the tech trends that are making your product possible today  That s kind of what I really want to see when I talk to younger companies  The answer to these questions distinguish people who are playing startup from people who really want to grow a business  With the relative ease of access to capital and relative ease of developing software these days  a lot of people are definitely playing startup  I think they should be thinking a little bit more to break into these components such as the future of your domain  So if someone says I m gonna build a project management tool  I ask what s changed in project management  If their answer is  Basecamp s UI is a little bit older   that s not a thing  It might be true but that s not gonna be a driving force behind any sort of significant shift  Trends worth betting on On demand purchase is changing  Anything that can be delivered real time wins  Subscription purchasing is changing  We re now at a time where the dude who did the dollar shave commercial is now at  316 million  So  the joke s on us  you know  What he saw was the rise and the growth of subscription services for recurring commercial purchases by consumers  He piggybacked that trend for a very specific recurring purchase for guys  If you re building a messaging app  what s changing in messaging that creates an opening for a product like yours  Or in marketing  what s changing in marketing to create an opening for a product like yours  If you don t have this  it s usually signed over to the domain expertise  That means you ll hear people say things like   Oh  we re gonna make a medical play   I ll ask  What s changing in medicine   Just because you don t see any software there  doesn t mean it s enough to base something on  Similarly  what tech trends are you gonna bet on  Your product doesn t exist in isolation of technology  which shouldn t be surprising given that it s a technology product  Consider what trends are worth betting on  Does Apple Watch mean anything for us  Or does the connected home mean anything  You know  the connected home idea that your television can make toast  and your toaster can call you and turn off your thermostat  How does it affect your domain  It s now cheaper than ever to build software  deploy software  to store information  to compute information  to retrieve information  Bandwidth  hosting  storage  computational costs are all falling off a cliff thanks to the prevalence of technologies like Amazon  Microsoft  etc  That s enabled a lot of stuff that previously just did not make sense  It enables things like we ll hold a terabyte of your photos for free  and will work at a different way to make money  It s a whole new type of business that s supported by this type of stuff  Interestingly  one of the common arguments as to why we re not in a bubble right now is predicated on this idea that you had to raise money to go and buy a fleet of service  or buy a load of database  All of those costs are now no longer upfront capital anymore  They re all subscription capital  Which means that when you re raising money these days  you re not actually throwing away the first two million into hardware  You re actually putting it all into product  Obviously the cost of building a product has gone down as well which means you re actually putting it usually into growth or scale  Take the prevalence of all these messaging apps  Everyone single one of these is a messaging app  But there are four or five multi million businesses on this slide who are not necessarily jokes  The idea that 30 people can build WhatsApp and take down the entire global SMS network by outpacing it 6 to 1  and selling the business for  19 billion dollars  that just wasn t possible in 2000  That s the type of things that are possible today  Why do you exist other than to make money  If we forget about money for a second and think about why you re actually setting out to do all this  that s the the piece that will last  and cause you could have commercial success  The question is what change you actually want to make  I think it s a really  really important one to reflect over  As I said  if things aren t going so well  right  and your only motivation is cash  your inspiration is just to walk out the door and go get a job at Google  And if things are going well and you get the cash  then your inspiration is to stop doing things and retire  So  you re real determined desire to change is actually the thing that keeps you going  When I ask people like  what are you actually trying to do  I don t want to hear   We re gonna do 10 million in revenue  or we re gonna be the leading provider of hosted net    They re stepping stones to what  It s best captured in short statements  With Intercom we want to make internet business personal  Stripe want to increase the GDP of the internet  Instacart wants to build the best place for anyone in the world to shop for groceries  Uber wants to make public transport as reliable as running water  It s fair to say  London cabbies do not  And I say that only because I ve had way too many  200 taxis from Heathrow  If you are doing this  it s crucial to start small  One of the guiding principles for us at Intercom is to have an insanely big idea but to start with an insanely small step  It s like Gall s law  Gall s Law says loosely that  a complex system built from scratch will fail  It can t ever be made to work  The only way you make it work is to build a simple system and evolve to complex  If you find yourself with a complex system that isn t working  throw it away  You cannot pivot or iterate or hire another 100 engineers  There s no recovery  You are in trouble  I m choosing my words carefully based on the age group  Take Salesforce  You could argue Salesforce is either complex or not  But one thing you can t really argue is that  they have  by anyone s standards  a fair whack of products  Salesforce are now a complex system but they didn t start that way  They started on something that was much smaller  right   Here s Salesforce initial launch page  They have two highlights  One of them is free membership  And the other one is that you can forecast the pipeline  This is what they shipped  They absolutely did start with a very small offering  Using their end goal as your starting point is a really  really messy way to look at it because if you re modeling yourself off one of the big successes like Salesforce or Microsoft  start where they started  not where they finished   Microsoft Word today  on the bottom   Microsoft Word where it started  on top   If this looks complex  that s just because somebody launched the About box  Word is the whipping boy of UX designers  But it s also the second most commercially successful piece of software of all time  I always like to use that for my UX designers  Maybe you all don t know what you re talking about  If you want to sit down and build a Word competitor today  you don t start here  You start somewhere like here  And if you want to see what that really looks like  have a look at the first release of Google Docs  Which is exactly all it was  and now look at where they are today and you ll sort of see that shift evolve  So  starting small is really  really important  What kinda feeds that is when you know your problem well enough  you can distill the solution down to small set of workflows which you then build features to enable  Your first release should be like the smallest product that solves a problem for your user  The feature drop   the biggest fallacy you can fall into Thinking you re just one more feature away from mass adoption is a fallacy  If that is true  it means that you didn t start from the right place  Which means you probably don t know the domain well enough  If you can t get adoption of your first release  you either don t understand the problem  or your execution s broken Neither of those problem is worth ignoring  The easiest thing in the world is to fall into this sort of death trap of  no one s using our product   Why don t we ask people why they re not using our product  Then they re gonna tell us  Here s another 10 features I just daydreamed  If we build those features  we ll get even less people are using our product  That s the death trap described by Andrew Chen  if you can t distill the problem you re trying to solve down to an initial release that people actually do want  forget about expanding it  Lord knows we don t need more software nobody uses  I see a lot of people mess this up when they decide to launch a beta  It s a default tendency of startups to think that betas are pretty straightforward thing to do  You collect email addresses  make a vague pitch and see how many people respond  But a beta is something you have to manage just as much as you manage any other release of your software  You don t get to wave some sort of flag saying  It s OK that it s crap   Putting a crap landing page together is very easy  There are whole products that will do this for you  You put up some vague background image  some vague piece of text and collect email addresses  And you might consider yourself a success  You might even go and print up business cards saying you re an entrepreneur having doing such a thing  It s important to realise that s not actually doing anything per se  A small list of target users beats a big list of non customers  or even a big list of some customers mixed in with a load of people who don t really care either way  One trend I really hate is this idea of giving away something free to grow our list  or giving away a free Apple watch if you want to grow a list of people who want Apple watches  That s what giving away a free Apple watch does  Now  if you happen to sell Apple watches  that s a great list to have  So  Apple should totally do this  If you happen to sell software that works on Apple watches  that s an OK list to have  Although it does mean most people on your list don t actually have one  But what s certainly not useful is if you re trying to build the next generation of photography tools or project management  You ve got these 10 000 people who are psyched about an Apple watch  which is not really relevant  You may as well hand out flowers at your local church for your software  There s no consistent pattern that unifies these people  The other thing people do with a beta is they build really vague pitches for their product  This is one I made up  It s photography reimagined  You all have a different opinion about what photography reimagined does  right  Some people are thinking  what if there was no camera  While a lot of people are thinking  we should bring back that filter in Instagram they removed  There s various different opinions about what this means  If you offer a really big vague pitch for your product  what you ll get is a big set of vague customers for your product   or would be customers for your product  That will get you is a wide ranging feedback for loads of different problems that exist only in people s head  One person wants to sell their photos  Another person wants to collaborate with their art director  Someone wants to export to Instagram  Someone else wants filters  If you don t really check yourself  you will literally wreck yourself  You ll go and build such a tool  That s what happens when you run a beta that tries to include everyone  By definition  your product has to exclude people  I don t mean form a typical exclusion sentiment  If you re selling photography tools  people who aren t photographers shouldn t be interested in your product  Building stuff to satisfy your entire beta list when it consists of a really varied group of people will get you a one size fits none product  Good and bad beta users Good beta users will give you good data to let you know when you cross this mythical  good enough to use line  And bad beta users will tell you that you re still just one feature away  and that s the end for that previous trial  You ll never get a beta user saying  I think you re good to go  You should start charging me   That never happens  If that happens to you  you re one of the lucky few  Most people will just say   You haven t even built account reset yet  How could you possibly exit beta     It s like that quote  when you say  iterate  I try to hear working until it s great  And that s the trap you might fall into frequently  Another example of this was Steve Jobs  when he was describing the iMovie Export Flow  He was probably had a load of wireframes on the wall  analyst reports and all that sort of stuff  He thought  what is all this junk  But then he said  Here is the new application   It s got one window  You drag a video into it  You click burn  That s it  That s what we re gonna make  That s the sort clarity of thought that actually lets you know what done looks like  Another example is Lorne Michaels  creator of Saturday Night Live  I love this quote from Tina Fey s book  where talks about her early days as a writer  comedy writer on Saturday Night Live  It was 9 o clock on a Saturday night  She said   We re not quite there yet  The jokes aren t exactly ready  She was used to that being OK to even say  Lorne just said   Ready   The show doesn t go on cause it s  ready   It goes on cause it s 11 30 on a Saturday night  We don t get our own definition of ready here  They re 15 million people about to start watching this  It s ready  you know  The key point is  you have to exit your beta via the Steve Jobs model  Here s what it is  and here s what we re going to do  Or you exit by a deadline which is  whatever we ve got by August 1st  that s what we re gonna try out with our users  If it s not in by then  c est la vie  But above all  get out of beta  Don t do this sort of Web 2 0 thing that was perpetual betas   The real reason for this is that betas are horrible sign up flow  If you think of how you design a sign up flow  and think a of the time people spend optimising these things  A beta design flow looks like this  You visit a website  sign up to be notified  get an email address  Then a long period later  you get an invite email  You create an account  complete a free trial and sign up for a real account  You ve introduced this incredibly lousy step  with a 1 6 week gap in it for no reason  And you re gonna lose a lot of potential customers while you re in beta cause they sign up for something when they re motivated to use it  And then they just forgot about it  The actual attrition is horrible  especially in consumer products  but also in B2B products  Consumer products are like people goofing around on the Net  they stumble upon this thing  and it sounds cool  so they try to use it  In business products  what you ll see is  people have this need to solve this problem  They actually can t wait seven weeks while you decide to rollout invite list number four because they actually have a problem today  So  they re just gonna go and use somebody else s product that solves the problem  Another option is to keep quiet while in beta  Talking is so cheap  It s easy to sell all these new things that are coming in the future  You re setting yourself up for disappointment in the eyes of your customers  And there s nothing worse than a non existing disappointment  The less you say  the more people listen  The press only cares about new  Your best angle is when you launch  The irony is AirBnB launched three times or four times  Because if you launch and no one notices  that fine  The worse thing that happens is you launch  peoplenotice and they don t like your product because it s not ready or whatever  And then you re like  You ve spent the only PR credits you have  The danger of dogfooding Another classic thing I see is when you actually do go to market  someone tries to sign up and they act confused as hell  They ask  Did you guys not do any QA   So  we don t need to    They ll say   We used our own product  Or  We re dogfooding   Or some nonsense that basically translates to   We forgot to actually try and use this thing like real people   Interestingly  signing up for your product is the one thing that every user will do  It s your widest adopted feature if you like  right  It merits a lot of effort  a lot of reconsideration  a lot of improvement  consistently  It s the only thing that everyone s definitely gonna do  And conversely  the disappointing part here is that  most product owners sign up for their product once  And they think that s fine except for when they did sign up for the product  it looked like this  Right  This is how most entrepreneurs sign up for their own product  They do it as this byproduct of creating an SQL database  And as a result they will meander through all of these and forget how janky it can be to have a seven step sign up flow  or how annoying it is to have to click all these boxes  or enter all your friends  The other cost if you re not doing it frequently  is that your product will go out of date  Your docs will go out of date  your welcome emails  your videos  All that sort of stuff is out of date because no one in your team is actually doing this recurringly  so you forget to realise that Step 2 is gone now  Your entire flow is basically broken because no one s job is to actually consistently do this  If you re dogfooding  like most people you should feed your dog every day  Similarly  you should never stop signing up for your product  In Intercom  we have a growth team  One of their core things to do is to consistently innovate on what it feels like to start using it Intercom  It s phenomenally high impact team  An undying focus on what it means to become an Intercom customer has been hugely valuable for the company  And honestly  I just wish we had done it years earlier  When you do get out there into the market  you ll see competition  And there s a very na ve view people have about competition which is  you know  I m a time tracker on the web  Therefore  my number one competitor is other web based time trackers  And that s only true when your customers are people who refresh product into time tracking category  But most customers aren t like that  Similarly  if you re selling flowers  you might think that your competitors are all the other people who sell flowers and that s a fair assumption  But then I d ask you   When do flowers and chocolate compete   When do flowers compete with chocolate  Valentine s Day  Like lots of similar things  It s a general gift of sorts  One of these products thinks it s in the fast moving consumer edible industry  And the other one belongs in the gardening industry  They re two different industries  Two different categories  Two different everything but they re probably direct competitors for certain jobs  Understanding real competitors Twitter competes with games every time you re bored  And you ll play whichever is quickest  The decision is  Should I use Twitter or Facebook or Angry Birds or Monument Valley or any of these sort of millions of things that I can do to entertain myself   The way I think about this is you have direct competitors and direct competitors that do the same job in the same way  So  direct competitors are like McDonald s and Burger King  You have indirect competitors which do the same job in a different way  So like Skype versus business class travel  for example  And then you have like sort of territory competitors and they do conflicting jobs  So  Weight Watchers and McDonald s are actually competing for the same customers quite often  There s only one unit of purchase to be had there  You re either doing one or the other  but they re both fighting for the same person  A point I often make to people who do project management or like a to do list software is that a Post it is your number one competitor  I have a friend who works on a to do list app  I told him to look at a Post it and realise all the features it has He thought I was crazy  so I left like a Sharpie and a set of Post its on his desk  Lo and behold  he started to use them  Why did you use them   It was actually quicker   So speed is actually an attribute taking a note   I also wanted to give it somebody else   So sharing is an important trait as well    I needed a physical reminder  so that I can t do anything else   So there s a blocking element here as well  You don t even want to see the rest of your list  And that s important to realise  We take all these things for granted  His road map did not have these types of trait on it  It was also more about building an API  I m sure you do  but bear in mind you re still losing to 3M here   Similarly  email is a ferocious competitor  All your customers already have it  In that regard  they don t even need to fight  How many people here send emails to themselves  How weird is that  Most to do list entrepreneurs out there that are denying this behavior  They say   People aren t going to email themselves  My tool is way better than that  It s way cleaner to log into mine  connect your Facebook thing  add a note  and then like stick it into two lists  and then set up notifications  sort of pings your phone  That s not easy at all  You re competing with a Post It and an email here  You have to understand your competitors  and your real competitors  And that s what lets you understand switching behavior  Switching behavior is when you actually think you have a superior product  understanding how people will get there  And as I said  your competitors aren t necessarily  the people who are in the same crunch category as you  Switching behavior is what takes you from the old to the new  And there s some really good research on it that I ll just quickly walk through  but it s very easy to remember  The four forces  Bob Moesta calls this the four forces  There s two reasons why you would change to a new product  And there s two reasons why you would not make the change  The green arrows are problems with the current product  So  why are you considering changing your email client  Because Mailbox doesn t have this feature  So  what are the actual problems with your existing solution  Where do Post its fail  for example  right  Does the attraction of the new product  which is your product  So  what are you trying to sell  And how do you make yourself seem as attractive as possible as like  as smooth  and slick  and sharp  and modern and fresh  And all of these that are sort of traits that people desire  You can control the attraction of your product  Then why don t people switch  Well  one of them is anxiety  or the uncertainty of change  If I switch to your product  will you still have my Slack plugin or that I need  that my whole work flow depends on  Will my team adopt it   What happens if they don t  Will I look like a fool having to roll back on the decision  And then lastly  there s existing habits and allegiances  For example  I ve already bought this enterprise plan  And we re already taken all these training courses and we ve already bought the manuals  And in the world of phones  I ve already bought the car plug  and the lamp plug  and all these other things that make my phone work really well  That s the way a switch happens is  If the green forces are both aligned or have the red forces below the line  somebody will switch to your product  If that s not the case  they won t  Basically  the switch is not worth the risk  So  you need to maximize the top forces and minimize the bottom ones  And what does that mean  Remind people of every single problem that they have with their current solution  Maximize your attraction   look as good  as fresh  as modern  as fast as problem solving as much as possible  Minimize the anxiety  so they don t need to worry that you re not gonna work with all of their files  or that you re not gonna integrate with all of their tools  The best campaign that ever did this  in my opinion  was the   I m a MAC  campaign  It presented the MAC as being this young  cool  attractive  popular thing  and the PC as being this old buffoon  You re attacking every single fear that people ever had  And what do they call that campaign  does anyone remember  The switch  The entire thing was deliberately done  The 9x effect  When customers are evaluating what they have  there s three reasons that leads them to over evaluate  They typically over evaluate their current work flow  No matter or bad or good it is  they over evaluate by about three times  There s the endowment effect  which basically translates to   I already have this  I don t like changing things  And also  this just sounds like a risk to change   And sadly a company has over valued their benefits by three as well  Most companies think their product is about three times better than it actually is  They didn t focus on the exact job that they solved  They got too obsessed with the category  They built something that only matters to a few niche cases  They ve built a load of features that certain people don t really want  Even though people only care about two  Those other 43 that you re really excited about literally couldn t care less  Being diligent with your roadmap Roadmaps are a fight  They are a mess  They re usually  the cause of people to break down and fight  alcoholism  all sorts of things could be caused by roadmap discussions  I ve presented this diagram a few times  So  I m gonna skip over this piece quickly  But suffice to say  it s important to be able to understand and answer this  This is basically a question of who s using your product  and how often are they using it  Every single time I talk to entrepreneurs  they ll say they don t know what to build next  So  I draw this axis  By the way  this isn t a literal tool and you should never expect software to do this for you  This is a way to think about your product  On one axis we re gonna say   How often do people usually use your product  Very little or all of the time    And then the other axis  we want to say   How many people have used it out of those that can  Very few  or all of them    Then try and place your features along here  Lo and behold most people do that and their first guess is almost always wrong  You can actually tell the sense of delusion  Product managers or owners will have based on how wrong they are here  They ll say that everyone uses our photo filters Then you ll go to a database and run a query like  out of those who can use photo filters  how many did 4  That happens very frequently  You d be shocked  I ve come to the conclusion when you actually have the data  and I m not a data driven person at all  don t let them be overridden by opinion  And the fact is  do people use this feature  There s a lot of biases that will force you away from answering that one honestly  Which is  I spent months building that  It doesn t matter  It really doesn t matter  A simple way to think about this is that the features in the top right are actually your core product  Anything here is something that is not used that often by your customers  It doesn t mean it has to go but it does mean you should question why it s not used more  And if that s a desirable behavior it looks like you ve tiptoed into consulting where you built a feature for a specific customer  and it s just for them them that use it  And now you have to maintain it and no one else cares  There s hard questions you have to ask about removing those features  or trying to get them better adopted  Which is basically what it comes down to   you have to be insanely diligent about your roadmap  This is one of the things that isn t true for startups  It s just true  You have four times the work you re gonna do  like improve a feature  that is to make a feature better for those who are currently using it  Get more people to use the feature  Get people to use the feature more  And then add a new feature to support a new workflow  Understanding tradeoffs When you re improving features  you have to understand there s tradeoffs between the quality  the importance  the satisfaction  and frequency when you re improving things  And what that looks like is  Quality   how well executed is it currently   Importance   how important for users is it  So  like  is tagging photos really that important versus uploading photos   Satisfaction   how happy are users with it today   Frequency   how often are they actually using it  You have to realise  if you ve got something that s frequently unsatisfying  that s going to upset users  If you ve got something that is unsatisfying  but not important and infrequently used  it s probably fine  You know the forgotten password form  Whenever I see people have put in some nice slick animations and stuff like that  I m like  either you guys have a sincere problem with people forgetting passwords  or you ve just thrown away many  many weeks of a development effort to polish something that no one really wants to use  Anthony Ulwick has a very simple framework for this which he calls the important satisfaction opportunity  For any given product  be aware of any problems with any of my projects  He assigned an importance from the user s point of view  Like how important is it that they can do it  And maybe give that like 9 out of 12  or 9 out of 10   Satisfaction means how happy are users with it today  The opportunity is basically it s the importance plus the data between importance and satisfaction  It s a simple framework  I don t believe necessarily in this science behind any of these  Just like the whole 3x  9x thing  What I do believe is that they present really good ways to rationally think about your product  For example  Anthony s point here s that the opportunity for working on any given feature has got to do with how important it is  and how much it sucks relative to how important it is to customers  And that s a very simple way to think about it  The temptation  by the way from any of these frameworks  even going back to mine with the thing with the two axis  is that you re gonna go and draw up a list  And  you ll be like  ok  these are all the things you re gonna work on  Be careful how you use lists in your product map  This sounds like a meta point  but I see this happen a lot where people do some research and they come up with a list of things we need to work on  And here s our team  But what does your roadmap look like  It s tempting to go and ship all of the things that matter  That seems somewhat rational but you re ignoring a lot of things here  You re ignoring how important any of these projects are and how hard any of them are as well  The guy from Google Docs  wrote a simple article about this  Google Docs did exactly this  and then eventually they met some actual customers  And they said to customers   We re working on everything that matters   But the customers were really upset  So the Google Docs guys gave each customer  100 and let them can choose where to spend all your efforts  So he gives  100  and said  just drop it in the bucket of whatever feature you want  The most incredible thing happened  The funniest thing was one user went over  dropped their  100 into the bold  italics  underlining and formatting box  opened up their wallet and put in another  100 of their own cash  That s hilarious but it touches on something that s not well captured in lists   where your users care has nothing to do with the list of things as you ve prioritised them  And if you actually knew that  you would do as Google Docs did  Which is you d say  well  actually let s get everyone on that until that problems gone away  It s the Babe Ruth problem  If you sort all baseball players by all time  it will look like Babe Ruth s number one and someone else is number two  But the gap is huge  Just like if you ranked the solar system by habitability of planets  you can t say we should go to Mars because Earth is probably too packed  It doesn t work like that  Sometimes there are binary  very significant players on your list  So now  how could we get people to use the feature more  The simple tricks here which are relevant are things like  how can we create habits  or use triggers or create rewards  or use smart defaults  or smart contacts  or more ways to get people to use this feature  For example  if we take something such as  I want people to refresh their Twitter feed more  Well  we could either put more stuff in it  We could trigger them to send them notifications  We could send them more triggers  We could make it refreshable and mobile  We could send them an email list of it  We could make them refresh it on their watch  But all of these things make it easy to use the feature more  Take the push for pizza example  a popular app in SF at the moment  It has one button  you push it and it will order pizza for you  They ve used smart contacts to where it defaults to make it very easy to do something frequently  So  when you re sitting there thinking if you want food  could actually have a pizza show up in 20 minutes if you just press a button  You re gonna do that more than you are going to go to the Domino s pizza configurator and go through a five step wizard asking you all these various question  When you re looking for frequency  these are the things you need to think about  Looking for adoption,"[154 561 691 1316 1390 610 327 680 529 1145 609]"
157,training-dataset/product/595.txt,product,Rethinking customer support automationIn most cases  customers get in touch with businesses because they have a question they need answered  or a problem they need fixed  But what customers need can vary dramatically   These questions and problems come in all shapes and sizes  Some are easy to answer  some are hard  Some are quick to answer  some take a long time  Some questions are really common  some are rare or even unique  Some questions benefit from providing visual instructions  some can be resolved with words alone   When you consider how a business could answer all these questions  there are multiple options  One option is to hire support staff  and train them in answering the questions  This is personal  but is expensive and time consuming  Another option is to use computers instead of support staff  this could be via a website  or a voice answering system  etc    and have the system attempt to answer the questions without human intervention  Computers are cheap and plentiful  but they lack empathy  and only sometimes understand the question being asked  The human language processing technology we have available isn t good enough yet for computers to understand most of the hard questions people have   So it is clear that some questions simply need people to resolve them  whereas others can be resolved by a computer  Most businesses today get this wrong  Concerned with short term financial costs  they over optimise for cheap impersonal computers  employing them to answer and fix questions that only people can  And worst of all  when it goes wrong  customers get frustrated  annoyed  and start to resent the business   Over automating leads to customer frustration  We ve all experienced this  Calling a business only to get an answering machine full of irrelevant options  Trying to talk to a person but ending in voice jail  where talking to a person is in fact impossible  and the only option is to hang up and try something else  Or equally as bad  hunting around on a website or an app  trying desperately to find a way to contact a person in the business without any success   This trend of businesses employing computers to do tasks that humans are better at is getting worse  The latest over hyped example is chatbots  Chatbots are still computers  they still lack empathy  and the reality is that the technology is not far along in its development  Most chatbots are simple  if this then that  logic trees  The exact same technology that is used in the voice jail experiences we all hate   Meanwhile  these commonly frustrating experiences are happening against a backdrop of customers demanding  expecting  and rewarding more personal connection and transparency in business  Technology has enabled people to contact any of their friends and family anytime in multiple rich ways  and they are increasingly expecting the same from businesses  The younger the audience  the more pronounced this is  The future isn t voice jail and faceless website FAQs   Problems need to be able to move between people and computers  So the key to success then is understanding when customers have common   easy  or rare   hard questions  and when computers can be used instead of humans  When questions or problems are common   easy  computers shine  When they are rare   hard  computers come up short   The hardest part is that sometimes  what starts as something that looks common   easy  can actually turn out to be rare   hard  The inverse also happens  What starts as something that looks rare   hard  can actually be common   easy  Customers don t always find it easy to articulate what they need  So providing world class support means understanding what your customers are asking  and designing your support solutions around that  The best of all worlds is customers being able to get the answers they need in the fastest most efficient way  and support staff only working on the rare  hard questions,"[157 312 684 418 327 164 925 154 883 561 1327]"
164,training-dataset/product/789.txt,product,Why voice will be the dominant chatbot interfaceWhen consumer internet arrived in the 1990s  it ushered in a new age of communication  Free internet chat applications like ICQ  MSN and AIM were limitless and meant we no longer had to rely on expensive and metered phone calls  Yet it was text  not voice that was to dominate in the years to come  Slow dial up internet meant we ended up typing to each other  not talking to each other  So in a world of 4G and fibre broadband  why are we still clinging to text interfaces in unsuitable contexts  Nowhere is this clearer than with chatbots  Text based messaging between humans is useful because it s asynchronous   we re happy for the conversation to carry on later  But chatbots are different  They represent the return of the command line interface   call and response   so we expect communication in real time  2016 saw thousands of new chatbots emerge  and while texting with them might have seemed fun  they consistently delivered sub optimal value  Typing on small screens with friends is convenient  but text based interactions with chatbots less so  The effort rarely reaps the rewards we expect   Is Facebook s 1 800 Flowers bot really making things easier  Text based messaging works best with a human on both sides of the conversation Imagine walking into Starbucks and ordering a  Venti  half whole milk  one quarter 1   one quarter non fat  extra hot  split quad shots  no foam latte  with whip  2 packets of splenda  1 sugar in the raw  a touch of vanilla syrup and 3 short sprinkles of cinnamon   Now imagine again if Starbucks insisted each part of the order was written by customers on a separate Post it note  If Starbucks had never employed humans all over the world parsing each and every voice based order  they would not be the global success they are today  Therein lies the challenge with today s chatbots  The way we ask for their help   through text  not speech   is unnatural for humans  Which makes sense  We ve been muttering and grunting at each other for at least 100 000 years  but writing things down for only 5 000 of them  Text based messaging works best with a human on both sides of the conversation  Humans understand the context  intent and sentiment of other humans  A conversation with a text based chatbot lacks human emotion  clarity  and urgency  Surely there must be a better way  Drawing inspiration from offline conversations To explore ways in which voice can make chatbots more useful  let s use a simple example of a normal everyday conversation between two humans  It s Friday afternoon  and Jim calls Jane  Both work on opposite sides of New York City  They chat for a few minutes to plan grabbing dinner and drinks  and maybe take in a Broadway play after work  Jim adds Concierge Bot to the conversation with a simple command  Jim   Hey  Concierge Bot  Concierge Bot   How can I help   Jim   Jane and I would like to meet near West 47th Street and 9th Avenue for drinks at 5pm  have dinner close by at 6pm  and would love to see a comedy show at around 8pm   Concierge Bot   Bar Centrale serve cocktails  and Obao serve an Asian fusion menu with availability at 6pm for 2 people  Drunk Shakespeare have availability for their 8pm show  Would you like me to reserve these options for you   Jim   Yes  please   Concierge Bot   Should I use the Mastercard you have on file   Jim   Yes  please   Concierge Bot   I ve booked Bar Centrale  Obao  and Drunk Shakespeare using your Mastercard  Confirmation is on it s way to you now  Can I help with anything else   Jim   No  thank you   Concierge Bot then leaves the conversation  leaving Jim and Jane to continue to catch up  Voice bot technology is here right now A human like  voice bot conversation like the one described above may sound like a vague futuristic promise  but we re closer to this than you might think  The technology required exists today   Take Google Assistant  a significant leap towards our voice bot future  Two way  contextually aware conversations are possible  making a variety of day to day tasks fast and easy to complete  With one simple voice command  it s easy to add multiple items to your shopping list  After that  simply ask  When does Whole Foods close   to know when to pop out to pick up your groceries  And  when cooking dinner  setting multiple timers for different items you re cooking is as simple as  set a 12 minute timer for pizza  set a 20 minute timer for lasagna   Massive utility value  for tiny effort or input  Voice commands are useful everywhere  Whether at home through Google Voice  or on the go using Google Pixel  the same natural commands are close by to help you day and night  Remember our earlier example of a complicated coffee order  One example of voice bot value on the go is Starbucks  initiative to take voice based ordering out of their stores and into our pockets  Utilizing voice commands and AI  Starbucks will make it easy for customers to call in their order on the way to the store  ready for them to pick up minutes later  The same efficient voice based process  but with extra time saving benefits  as customers won t have to get to the store to place the order  Just imagine walking to Starbucks to meet your friends  calling them to tell them you re on your way  and including a Starbucks Barista bot in the conversation to tell them which complicated coffee order to prepare ahead of your arrival  Voice will transform business communication too,"[164 418 529 680 632 878 86 157

187,training-dataset/business/1029.txt,business,Freelancing with depressionAnyone who knows me pretty well would tell you I m a happy person   Anyone who knows me really well knows I m not   My narrative is punctuated with depressive episodes and panic attacks  always taking me by surprise but never totally fading away   A story that hit too close to home  I know the exact date and time my most recent depression started   While getting dressed one morning in August  after some hesitation  I put on a podcast featuring the recently deceased Parks and Rec writer Harris Wittels talking about his rehab experience  The podcast was released posthumously  and I knew it wouldn t be an easy listen   Something about the HW story brings me to my knees likely the fact that  like me  he was a nice Jewish kid who loved Phish  writing  and prescription drugs  Our paths only differed when he moved to LA and started doing heroin and I moved to Tel Aviv and started working for startups   So  here I am  listening to this podcast  and all of a sudden  I get dizzy   On the podcast  Wittels says he decided to go to rehab for the last time when he realized he didn t understand why a person would actively care about being alive but I thought everyone felt that way   Beyond my dog would be thrown into a shelter and probably euthanized  I couldn t come up with a reason why I would want to not die   I had a realization  Something was seriously wrong with my brain   Something was seriously wrong with me   Something inside of me collapsed  I couldn t get up from the couch  I couldn t finish getting dressed   From that minute  for the next 4 months  my life went from  pretty okay punctuated with some good and bad  to  a house of horrors that doesn t have an exit ha ha ha    You can t call in sick with the weepies  In a perfect world  I would have recognized that moment as the beginning of a downward spiral and gotten some help  I would have called my clients  put a hold on my projects  and sought professional care   At the very least  I would have stayed on my antidepressants   Instead  I collapsed into myself  Having signed my 2 first ever consulting projects earlier that month  I told myself failure wasn t an option  and maybe staying busy would keep the weepies away   I made up excuses for my behavior   I claimed unrequited love for a neighbor who returned my advances with the enthusiasm usually reserved for day old sushi  I claimed heartbreak and loneliness  I claimed stress  I adopted another dog   Beyond sad or angry  I felt powerless  I didn t want to admit to what I was going through and how it was impacting my life  I wanted to enjoy the dream job I had created for myself or  at the very least  get my work done   I didn t want to let anyone down   I signed another client and quickly began the process of torpedoing my career   Being depressed is exhausting  Not a high energy person on my best day  hiding the shitstorm of my life quickly became impossible   Usually somewhere on the spectrum between private and proud  I jumped off the whole thing  I stopped eating  sleeping  working out  and changing my clothes  instead living on coffee  soymilk  and a heavy air of sadness   I cried in my bed  I cried at the dog park  I cried at my clients  offices  I cried in my best friend s bathroom at his birthday party  I cried on a bench on Tel Aviv s main street  I cried in fitting rooms and cafes and concerts and anywhere else I might have ended up   All I expected from myself was to wake up in the morning  and anything else was exceptional   Work became daunting   My thought process went like this  If I don t get focused  I ll miss my deadline   If I can t meet this deadline  I ll get fired   If I get fired  I won t be able to ask the client to refer me to his friend who s opening a startup   If I go to the friend on my own  he ll ask the client about me and the client will tell him how badly I fucked up   If I miss this deadline  I ll never sign a new client again and I ll lose my apartment and end up homeless   When it feels like your life path is entirely dependent upon every project going perfectly  it s hard to get started with anything because nothing is good enough  All of a sudden  it s not just a blog post that I m writing  it s whether I ll be able to pay rent for the rest of my life   The stakes were too high  and my anxiety became crippling   This behavior didn t go unnoticed  especially by people paying me to bring creativity and vibrancy to their products   Hired to make companies better  I became a drain on my clients  forgetting deadlines and making careless mistakes   Don t act surprised when I tell you every  single  one  of my clients fired me within 2 months   Client A  a branding project  said I was unprofessional and unreachable  and demanded half of her deposit back   Client B  a branding and copywriting project  said they had run through their marketing budget   Client C  the in house project  didn t even give me a reason  They didn t have to   And the worst part is  they were all right   I was so scared of choking  of underperforming or giving bad advice  that I gave them nothing instead dedicating myself to the only thing that made me feel better  lying on my bed and staring at the ceiling   Acknowledging my weaknesses in a real life way  Some people  most people  are less fragile than me   They can go to the office and do the work they need to do and then go home and feel okay about themselves   I can t   So how do I make my life work for me   I m not waiting for my life to set itself on fire   One day  I couldn t take the heaviness anymore  so I decided to leave   Freshly unemployed with no prospects  I booked a trip to visit my family across the world   I called it my mini  Eat  Pray  Love   I ate pizza  bagels  Indian food  and falafel  I m from New York   I slept and I went out and  for the first time in months  I didn t cross the street when I saw someone I knew   I felt human again   Of course  there was still a lot of dark in me  I was terrified to go back to Tel Aviv and collapse  I took steps while in New York to sign clients I loved and to find projects I cared about  I set boundaries for myself   After the shittiest and darkest months of my life  months that make me cringe with horror and I can t believe I said that and I can t believe I made it through that  I m too tired to be anything but honest with myself and my clients   I won t work from an office anymore  It s remote or bust   I won t take clients who demand nights and weekends  After Client A told me  Okay  you can go back to sleep now  after a frantic 1am phone call accusing me of not sending an email campaign that was actually just hanging out in her junk folder  I won t work with clients who don t respect my time   I won t work with teams I don t trust  I don t need any more horror stories like the marketing designer who didn t know what SEO was  or the product lead who told me  No one really notices typos anyway  Seriously  I m over it   I charge more  I work less  and I take time off when I need it  I m up front about my struggles and the pace I work at   I don t pretend to be a Fiverr machine  and I don t pretend to be a workaholic   I m an early riser  and I probably won t answer your late night email until tomorrow morning when I m able to answer carefully and conscientiously   Now the struggle is maintenance   Every day I have to fight the little fights  the fight to get things done on time without panicking  the fight to say no to unrealistic deadlines  the fight to eat well and exercise and sleep and see friends and do the things that keep me healthy and happy   My advice to you  Invest in your mental health   Don t waste any time pretending a crisis isn t happening  Don t convince yourself you need the money or the experience  If this happens to you  get help   You have plenty of time to get portfolio projects and make bank  and it will be much easier when you re healthy  Now is not that time   Find a mental health professional in your area that you can trust  Exercise  Get some sunshine  Get out of your town or city for a few days  Call a friend  Eat something delicious   Don t prioritize your career above yourself   Loads of freelancers struggle with depression  If you need someone to talk to  call 1 800

195,training-dataset/product/1399.txt,product,What do you do when someone  steals  your amazing idea The subject line read   did you see this   The message was from my editor Jen    Nir  I saw the headline on this story and thought it might be written by you but no   she wrote   Very weird    I instantly clicked on the link she d sent   It was uncanny  An article written by Christopher Mele at the New York Times  freakishly similar to a post I d written but hadn t yet published   My first thought was that I d accidentally tweeted a link to my draft or published my post by mistake  It was as if someone had hacked into my computer or read my mind  Mele s article used the same examples  cited the same research  and even linked to the same sources  I was so surprised  I sent Mele an email  though I d never been in contact with him before   asking if he d somehow read my draft   Meanwhile  I rushed to post what I d been working on  figuring this would at least prove I d been writing well before Mele s story appeared  Just then  Mele responded to my email saying he d never heard of my work   Of course he hadn t  And upon further reflection  I felt pretty foolish  Whom was I proving anything to  Who really cared   I d gotten so worked up  fearing someone had copied my ideas  that I let paranoia get the best of me  I d fallen into a cognitive trap   The sign of a novice  People tend to believe ideas are rare things  gems to be collected and hoarded  But in fact the nature of creative work  be it corporate innovation  academic research  or artistic endeavor  tells us quite the opposite that if a useful insight pops into your head  it s most likely in other people s minds as well   Where I live  in Silicon Valley  there s one sure clue when people are newbies to the tech community  they ask me to keep their ideas secret  Some entrepreneurs ask me to sign a non disclosure agreement  an easy tell they haven t been here long  With rare exceptions  few industry veterans sign NDAs for the simple fact that good ideas tend to come to different people around the same time   It s called the  multiple discovery theory   which  contrary to the  heroic theory of invention   posits that discoveries are most often made by multiple people  not by lone  geniuses   History is littered with examples  the formulation of calculus  the discovery of vitamin A  the development of the telephone  the light bulb  the jet engine  the atom bomb    When the time is ripe for certain things   the mathematician Farkas Bolyai said   these things appear in different places in the manner of violets coming to light in early spring    In many ways  discoveries are inevitable  since innovation occurs as a result of the prevailing environment as much as it does via the inspiration of a prepared mind  As Kevin Kelly explains in his book What Technology Wants   Each technological progression around the world follows a remarkably similar approximate order  Stone flakes yield to control of fire  then to cleavers and ball weapons    The sequence is fairly uniform  Knifepoints always follow fire  human burials always follow knifepoints  and the arch precedes welding   Each previous generation lays the latticework for the next discovery  unearthing insights we are bound to discover   In a world of inevitable simultaneous discoveries  there is no point to keeping most things secret  In fact  holding ideas close to one s vest comes with unforeseen costs  For example  not sharing your insights frequently and widely means missing out on feedback  Most of the bad startup ideas I hear are bad not because they re under threat of someone s stealing the idea  but because the founder doesn t know what he or she doesn t know   Sharing ideas means other people can show you your blind spots  Furthermore  overvaluing ideas makes us more likely to hold on to them  which in turn makes us more rigid to new and potentially contradictory evidence that might tell us to go in a different direction  Finally  idea fetishization blinds us to what s really important actually doing something useful with the idea  Ideas are easy execution is hard   The law of triviality  The British author C  Northcote Parkinson is famed for his  law of triviality   first elucidated in a satirical article published in 1957  Parkinson writes of a committee assembled to approve plans for a nuclear power plant that instead spends most of its time arguing about a bike shed  The fictional committee wastes so much time on the bike shed because people are more likely to have an opinion on things they understand  While few feel qualified to speak about nuclear power  everyone can put in their 2 cents about a bike shed   Triviality exerts its power in other ways  We have all  at one point or another  felt wronged by someone who has taken something from us  Like a child who breaks down crying after another kid swipes his crayon  we reflexively react  sometimes with strong emotion  before recognizing the triviality of the situation   Perhaps the most vicious childlike reactions come from thought leaders  Whereas business results can be measured with money  credit for ideas as property is harder to quantify  and the fight for that credit can bring out the worst in people  I ve lost count of the times I ve heard someone disparage an academic or an industry colleague as a hack  a charlatan  or an idea thief  As the political scientist Wallace Sayre has been credited as saying   In any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely proportional to the value of the issues at stake   Hence  we argue most about the things that matter least   When it came to my essay  I realized I d gotten worked up over nothing  My response looked even more ridiculous if you consider that both Mele  the New York Times author  and I cited other people s ideas to make our points   I should have been pleased that I d written something a publication like the New York Times also thought was important  When I checked Twitter after publishing my post  I noticed a kind tweet from Mele    nireyal Very cool blog and post today  Sorry you got  scooped  but does not diminish the

202,training-dataset/business/1477.txt,business,Google is right to ban short term loan ads  but I won t stop offering short term loans  Here s why Google is right to ban short term loan ads  but I won t stop offering short term loans  Here s why   Sasha Orloff  CEO of LendUp  I think payday loans are deeply problematic  But my company sells short term loans that look similar and serve the same customers  Last week  Google banned ads for payday loans  Yet earlier this year  Google Ventures  GV  invested in my company  LendUp   Obviously  this sounds like a lot of contradiction  But the truth is even though we were surprised by the announcement and would have taken a different approach  LendUp and Google agree on a fundamental fact  The current payday loan industry is bad for Americans  Google is applying pressure from the outside  and we applaud them  Meanwhile  LendUp is trying to change the system from the inside  and we have evidence that our technology can create better products for the same customers   Okay  I know  make the world a better place by selling short term loans  can sound absurd  If you re skeptical of our intentions   or just want to better understand exactly how crazy America s credit system is   please read on   How I got interested in credit  In 2001  I read a book called Banker to the Poor by Muhammad Yunus  Yunus pioneered the concept of microfinance   small loans for entrepreneurs who do not qualify for traditional banking  He created the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh  and then an organization called the Grameen Foundation that spread microfinance around the world  Later  he won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work   Yunus believes that it s possible to eliminate poverty around the world  When I read his book  it s excellent  and I highly recommend it   I decided to get involved  I joined the Grameen Foundation and moved to rural Honduras   It was supposed to be a six month volunteer stint  but it ended up being a full time job for three years as we replicated the Grameen Bank model in other parts of Latin America  While microfinance is not without its flaws  I saw firsthand how well structured credit helped entrepreneurs start and grow their businesses   The almighty American credit score  I wanted to see if well structured credit could similarly change people s lives here in the United States  When I returned  I interned at the World Bank and then worked at Citigroup s Consumer Lending division  One thing quickly became clear  the power of the credit score   In the U S   your credit score decides whether you have access to bank credit  insurance  apartments  even jobs  And your credit score dictates how much you ll pay  The average person with a low credit score will spend  250 000 more on interest and fees over the course of their life  That s insane   And we re not talking about some tiny sliver of the population  A full 56  of Americans   more than half    can t get access to traditional banks because their credit score is too low  Instead  their options are limited to payday loans  title loans  and other dangerous products  This shadow world of lenders has astronomical rates and hidden fees  and doesn t report to the credit bureaus  If your score is below 680 and you don t already have a  respectable  credit line  there are few paths for you to get ahead   So why don t the banks step up and offer services to this majority of Americans  After the 2008 financial meltdown   subprime  lending became a dirty word  and banks grew even more hesitant to develop products at the lower end of the credit market  Meanwhile  thanks to the same banking crisis  even more people were now considered subprime   For people who need to pay a bill right away  payday loans solve a real problem  These borrowers have jobs and make enough to pay the bills  but they don t have any financial slack  When a medical expense or car repair comes up  they can hit a shortfall   So if the electricity bill is due on the 13th  and payday is on the 15th  what do you do  If you don t have a credit card  you re in trouble  Banks can t or won t help  and in that market   especially since 2008   payday lenders have prospered to fill this growing need   There needs to be a scalable  self sustaining solution  I wanted to do something about the credit problem  and I talked over the challenges with my stepbrother  Jake Rosenberg  Jake  who was Zynga s CTO of Platform at the time  saw the situation as especially frustrating because technology had actually made things worse  Payday lenders were using the internet to set up online businesses outside of state level consumer protection laws  As someone who thinks software should make the world more efficient  not less  Jake found this offensive   Jake believed that better tech could change the dynamics of the industry  Payday lenders always offered the same terrible rates indefinitely  But with better underwriting and more sophisticated technology  borrowers could be offered better rates over time   So Jake and I decided to found LendUp  The idea was simple  We d offer loans and credit to people who couldn t qualify for normal banks  We d charge interest   in some cases  high interest   but unlike payday lenders  we d offer a path to better credit scores  better rates and real banking  We d also offer financial education  and move customers who took those courses along the path faster  We d have to build all of our own banking and risk assessment technology from scratch  but with Jake as CTO  I believed we could do it   Making positive change as a for profit company is complex  and we knew that going in  We set up four simple principles  and agreed to follow them to the letter  with absolutely no exception   even if it hurt our business   LendUp Principles  Ladders  LendUp s goal is to provide an actionable path for customers to access more money at a lower cost  Not chutes  Our business model is based on customers succeeding   repaying their loans on time and paying off their credit card balances  No rollovers  no debt traps  Ever  Transparency  We strive to make our products as easy to understand as possible  Building credit scores matters  While we don t require good credit  our products encourage and reward actions that result in higher credit scores   Basically  we want our customers to stop needing us for emergencies and give us less short term business over time   with the plan to eventually offer credit cards  savings  and investment products as they gain more financial slack   The LendUp model is already working  What bothers us the most about payday loans is how sticky they are  Even if you pay back a loan  you re stuck  You re always going to be offered the same expensive rate  If you don t pay back the loan  it gets incredibly expensive  fees on top of fees with no end in sight  In states where rollovers are allowed  payday loan rates can climb above 1000  APR   So we decided to start in the short term market  We thought we could turn these loans into an access point for traditional financial services  Our first product was an alternative called the LendUp Ladder  and it fixes what s broken about payday loans in a few important ways   When customers repay their loans  they can be eligible for larger loans at lower rates  it is almost unheard of for payday lenders to offer better terms     it is almost unheard of for payday lenders to offer better terms   In the top half of our Ladder  customers have the option to have their payments reported to the credit bureaus  payday lenders don t report     payday lenders don t report   When customers need more time to repay  we don t charge them extra  payday lenders use rollovers to make more money when their customers struggle     payday lenders use rollovers to make more money when their customers struggle   When customers make successful repayments  many can become eligible for a credit card  which is essentially an interest free short term loan  if paid on time and in full    As you probably guessed  payday lenders wouldn t dream of offering a credit card to their customers  A credit card  which many take for granted  is essentially a month long  zero interest loan  It s the surest way to immediately transform the industry   which is exactly what we want to do   The early results are encouraging  We estimate we saved our customers more than  16 million in 2015  and we ve already saved them another  16 million in 2016  More than 90 percent of our active users have access to credit building loans within two years  And we ve taken customers from having credit scores in the 300s two years ago to having a credit card today   Yes  we charge high interest rates for first time customers  First time borrowers regularly pay more than 250  APR   which sounds crazy  and it is expensive  but it s risk adjusted  If you mainly use credit cards  you re probably familiar with APRs between 7  and 36   But remember  if you have a credit card  you have a track record with the credit bureaus  In order to serve our customers  we take on a lot more uncertainty and risk in the name of helping them take that first step towards elusive credit building  Some customers do not pay us back and  like insurance  the interest rates covers what we lose  But when customers do pay us back  as the vast majority do  they de risk themselves  Where the Ladder is available  customers move up automatically through repayment  and become eligible for loans at a fraction of former rates   We saw ourselves as having to make a choice between access and cost  because lowering one means lowering the other  So  first we chose access  focusing on new customers  Then  we built the Ladder to drive down costs for existing customers  Now  as our technology improves  we will continue to make credit more affordable while maintaining accessibility  Today  we regularly approve customers with credit scores in the 300s   people who banks and credit unions don t serve   Also  to add context to those APRs  in California  rates vary by state   we charge around 16   or a fee of  32  to borrow  200 with our short term loans  The average loan lasts 22 days  so when you annualize our rate  you get a whopping 270  APR   Our short term loans are on Google s blacklist  but we re cool with that  So there s the rub  Because we offer short term loans and charge high interest rates in the beginning  the entry point to the LendUp Ladder will be blocked from paid advertising on Google   Does it feel good to be lumped in with the industry  Well  not exactly  But the marketing of these products has to change to better protect consumers from deceptive practices  illegal products and identity theft  If effectively enforced  Google s ban will push the payday loan marketing competition away from ads and toward natural search  where safer alternatives with quality content can shine  Obviously  I think that s good for LendUp   and good for Americans who are locked out of the banking system  We re proud of our work  and we re very happy to take the fight to a more reputable arena,"[202 595 154 561 1011 1316 1390

208,training-dataset/business/1068.txt,business,Startups  Software Development and the Art of Bicycle MaintenanceIf you re philosopher Lao Tzu  the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step  But if you re Edith Harbaugh  it starts with a celeste Bianchi road bike   and the voyage is 3 360 miles  It begins in the Pacific Northwest  hugs the Canadian border  traverses national parks  cuts through the Great Allegheny Passage and ends at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D C  Such treks are laden with lessons  but Harbaugh didn t expect how much her two month  cross country ride would inform how to build software and lead teams   Harbaugh is the CEO and Co founder of LaunchDarkly  a feature flag management platform  The startup enables engineering teams at companies   including clients such as CircleCI and AppDirect   to continuously deploy features at scale  as well as allowing business users to control code  Before starting LaunchDarkly  Harbaugh rose through the engineering and product management ranks at Vignette  Monster  Plantsense and TripIt  She s also a contributing writer at ReadWrite and Co host of the To Be Continuous Podcast   In this exclusive interview  Harbaugh shares how her lessons from the road serve as tactics for both starting a company and effective software development  She shares techniques for grinding through the long stretches  making choices at forks in the road and cultivating a mindset that ll give you enough to cross the finish line  Any founder or engineering leader seeking ways to equip and lead teams for the long haul will benefit from Harbaugh s tips  Let s get started   Break rides into legs   When Harbaugh decided to try her cross country bike ride  she was hesitant   I had read a lot of blogs and didn t want to have the humiliation of getting two weeks into it  finding it miserable  quitting and then having it be a failure   says Harbaugh   But I knew I really wanted to see Glacier National Park  So I titled my riding journal  To The Glaciers   As soon as did that my mindset shifted  I thought   Okay  that s about a two week trip  that s a doable and worth it   Once I got to Glacier National Park  I paused to ask   Am I still having fun   Ok  I ll go another week across Montana    Harbaugh broke that week  and all those that followed  into days and each day into checkpoints  a gas station for milk for breakfast  a little diner for lunch and a Subway for dinner   Each pit stop was about 40 miles apart  That allowed me to lock in my pace and arrival times  I knew I was on a cross country trip  but only experienced the glorious and gritty of the ride in 40 mile segments   she says   When you build software  deconstruct a feature in the same way  Break it into smaller steps   or minimum components that help you keep your pace and schedule    This concept isn t foreign to software teams  but what may be is what each component and checkpoint should entail   I think there s a belief that software is just the raw code  It s not  It s everything that connects to it  the documentation  marketing collateral and more   says Harbaugh   Focus on just the raw code is the equivalent of just paying attention to my bike  like checking the tires at a pit stop or adjusting my mirrors as I ride  If I don t pay attention to the overall health of my system  my fatigue  signalling to cars at intersections or reading the weather  I m in trouble  This isn t just a metaphor for running a company  but building software  It s all very connected  If you build a feature and no one knows about it  that feature doesn t exist    Software isn t just code but all that touches the product  Just like each leg of a ride entails the bike and all it moves through   Harbaugh isn t advocating that everyone on the software team must code  market the product  sell it   do it all from soup to nuts  But they must consider it as the build to be effective   The bottom line is that nothing pains an engineer more than to have worked hard on something that nobody uses   says Harbaugh   But how do people know to use it  That s marketing     The same principle of  breaking big steps into smaller ones  applies to starting a company   When I recruited my first engineer  he was hesitant  The company was pre revenue and seemed risky   says Harbaugh   I told him we had enough money to pay him for a one month contract while I tried to fundraise  During the month  he could interview anywhere he wanted  After a month  he could either stay or take any of the permanent jobs he wanted  That gave him   and me   enough time to make a better call  He stayed on for the ride    Every ride starts with zero   An integral part of Harbaugh s philosophy   as cyclist  CEO and seasoned product owner   is that every ride starts with zero  She had an odometer on her bike  and every day  she d reset it to zero  It helped her   Focus    I rode cross country before smart phones  What was then state of the art   my Blackberry Pearl   is now primitive  I needed to know  with dead reckoning  exactly where I was to ensure I was on track with my paper maps   says Harbaugh   Tools come and tools go  We re all in shock by the tools and processes we once used to ship  At times  the simplest tactics   like starting from zero   can keep you on track    Garner a sense of accomplishment    I found that if I didn t reset my odometer  each day seemed so insignificant  Today  I went from mile 560 to 610  That doesn t motivate me   says Harbaugh   I d rather focus on the difference   50 miles   than 610 miles  which reminds me I ve got more than 80  of the larger journey left to go  For both cycling and software development  measurement is vital  but too little is paid attention to which metrics motivate  If I hit 30 miles by lunch  I d think   Nice  By dinner  can I go another 40     Avoid complacency   Resetting the odometer kept me from resting on my laurels  Quite simply  if I didn t get on my bike and put in some miles  there d be no miles on the bike  The odometer would read zero for the day   says Harbaugh   So you finished the month hitting your revenue goal  Great  that s today s win  Tomorrow  we start from zero  This mindset celebrates wins and notes shortfalls   it just doesn t extend them    With cycling   as with product development   you win when you operate with focus  but you want to win when you sense progress   At the beginning of LaunchDarkly  Harbaugh championed weekly sprints with daily stand ups that includes not just engineering  but other functions like marketing and sales   Each day  we talk about what we did yesterday  Then  we discuss what we re going to do today  It keeps a one  or two year project from feeling daunting  I also find that it creates a great deal of pride and accountability   says Harbaugh   If you haven t found your cadence for sprints at a startup  don t fix the sprint durations in stone off the bat  I spoke with Kevin Henrikson  an engineering leader established two week sprints  but soon changed them to be one week long  He noticed that all the work got done in the last 3 or 4 days of the two week sprints    Edith Harbaugh  Write it down  You can always alter your route   Harbaugh kept an online journal as she crossed the country by bike   I knew this trip was something special  so of course I wanted to record what happened  I d take photos and write entries throughout my months on the road   says Harbaugh   However  I realize now that I was also doing a daily stand up   just solo  I was obsessively introspective about what was working and what wasn t with my rides  I noticed quickly the difference between being tired and cranky  the latter which meant   nearly always   that I needed to eat  These are thoughts that many let pass  but when you write them down  you get to realizations and changes faster    At LaunchDarkly  each team has its task list that it uses as much as a to do list as a capacity gauge   As I said  we do a weekly sprint where we establish what we re going to do   but before that  we review what we said we d do  I try to set the tone that it s fine if we don t hit every mark  as long as we dig into why   says Harbaugh   The important aspect is writing it down  The mind just processes it differently when it s written and team members can return to it asynchronously and as frequently as they want  Plus as a team  we can get a sense of if we are being too optimistic or not ambitious enough  Then we can adjust within a week    When new employees start at LaunchDarkly  Harbaugh tells them  at the end of your first week  you must publish a post on the company blog   Try it out at your company  I tell them that they can write anything they want and we ll edit it for grammar and spelling  but nothing else  It s unfiltered and it s fascinating   she says   Our ulterior motive is that we want to get a pulse of how people feel  how we re doing and what they think of the culture  The public component is a big part of our content marketing strategy  Everybody in our company blogs   product  sales  ops  everyone  I want them to get in the rhythm of it  I ask the engineers to write an article once a month  It helps crystallize what they re learning and is great marketing    You can t always A B test the way forward   From an early age  Harbaugh always liked riding bikes  As a teenager  she d venture out 10 miles to the Washington Beltway near her home in Virginia  Soon it was 18 miles out to Reston  24 miles out to Ashford and 30 miles to Leesburg  trying to get to the end of the 45 mile trail   I wasn t sure about 90 miles  so I asked my parents to drop me off at the end   45 miles away   and biked one way back in   says Harbaugh   By 16 years old  I built up enough confidence and endurance to complete the entire 90 mile rides    The point is that it s easier to test in some scenarios  than others   If your primary focus is learning  test away  Think creatively as you are breaking projects into smaller tasks or organizing an experiment   says Harbaugh   But it s different if you have a far off destination you need to hit  On a cross country ride   as in startup life   there are always diverging roads   It was all forks   all forks  On any given day  there were so many decisions on the path forward  In some cases  like Montana  there was one road forward  but it was the exception  not the rule   says Harborough   In every state  I d buy a paper map and scope out the best route  I wanted to avoid deserted roads and busy roads   both for reasons of safety  I looked for a road with a nice  wide shoulder and followed it  Sometimes that shoulder would peter out  and I d have to make multiple course corrections    While Harbaugh could A B test some parts of her journey   like which hotels gave her the best night s sleep or gas stations had the best snack selection   she couldn t with others   If I were to hit my daily pace  each checkpoint for a meal and get to lodging by dusk  I couldn t afford to double back to take another road   she says   I did my best in the planning stage when I entered a state and pushed ahead  The key was to trust in your pattern recognition and then roll with the punches    Over Harbaugh s career  this phenomenon has been most true with hiring   You can t A B test team composition  It s not a helpful process to rerun a scenario of hiring a person  You can t    That s especially true with small teams at startups   she says   It s about sample size  If you re fine tuning email marketing  you can do some complex A B testing if you re sending out 10 000 emails  You ll never be able to hire   or interview   10 000 people in a job cycle  I ll paraphrase Jocelyn Goldstein   You can t A B test your way to success  You have to find your guiding line   You re self propelled and self supported   Ask any founder or sales lead or engineering head who s accountable for building a company  customer base or app and the good ones point to themselves  The same goes for cycling  You re your engine  It s your two legs in rotation  propelling the bike and your body forward  That s obvious  but here s what Harbaugh learned from the road that helped her get better at that self fueled forward motion   Choose your differentiating equipment  When you re in for the long haul  on a bike or in a startup   choose your gear wisely  Don t cheap out  Identify what has an outsized impact on your performance   I was on my bike everyday  so I invested it  It wasn t top of the line  but it wasn t a  starter bike   I needed to count on it daily  My gloves protected my hands from the elements and my padded bike shorts kept me on the saddle to put in extra miles   says Harbaugh   Early on  when we were bootstrapping LaunchDarkly with our own money  my co founder John asked if he could buy a second monitor  He said he was used to it and it made him more a lot more productive  I asked him why he even asked  Buy it    And drop the rest  When Harbaugh started out she was schlepping 30 pounds of gear  when she finished  she carried just 12 pounds of essentials   As the days passed  I d think about how much weight was on my bike   what I literally had to carry forward  I swapped my canvas panniers for lighter ones and dropped 5 pounds  I started with 3 bathing suits   why  Dropped those   says Harbaugh   At work  I m the one without a standing desk  I know I won t use  so I didn t get one and saved  800    But keep experimenting with your differentiating equipment  When Harbaugh bought her bike  she knew it d be one of her critical tools  But she only learned exactly how it made the difference once she put hundreds of miles on it   Part of being   and staying   an expert is giving yourself permission to be a newbie  My bike pedals were stripped so badly that I couldn t use clip on pedals  Before going into Idaho  I had a bike shop drill out the shaft so I could put on clip ons   says Harbaugh   Initially  it was awful  I fell over  as I couldn t figure out how to take them off  or I d forget they were on and tip over at stop signs  But once I got more competent with clip on pedals  my speed increased by 1 to 1 5 mph   a significant gain over a 3 000 mile trip  Similarly  when I started LaunchDarkly  I didn t know how to pitch VCs  I was awful  Investors literally walked out on me  I kept iterating and now have raised over  11 million via multiple rounds of capital    Conserve energy  Harbaugh hit some insidious winds in the Midwest   It was pretty flat ride  but that meant no protection from huge headwinds  There were times where I felt I was barely pedaling but still had many miles to go  It s not always possible  but pull to the side  eat a snack  stretch your legs and consider  should I wait it out longer or get back at it   says Harbaugh   We take this approach in assessing our internal meetings  Each employee has a discrete amount of time and energy per day  We ll say   Hey  Justin  I don t think you re needed in this  Do you feel differently   By explaining at the onset why it s important and asking each other often we ve made it commonplace  not confrontational  It s a sign of respect  looking out for another s time and energy    You re gonna need extra gears   If you re not on a fixed gear or one speed bike  you ve got additional gears   and you ll need them   Gears mean you re more equipped to respond to the world around you  You re a big part of what moves the bike forward  but the external   tailwinds  headwinds  the incline of the road   all matter  If you re already running at top gear with no tolerance  you re screwed if you need to pick up the pace   says Harbaugh   The same goes with projects  I know developers who say that a sprint will take four weeks  but say they ll get it done in two weeks  You know what happens  It doesn t get done in two weeks and then your team s burnt out from trying  And there s more ahead    Extra gears means having capacity to do more  not the requirement to do more   The second biggest mistake I saw with failed cross country rides was a guy who pre booked all of his hotels on his trip  You d think that it was liberating to have that structure  but he was in its service in the end  He was locked in  He could not fall behind  And  what s worse  he couldn t get ahead  as his hotel for the night had to be his endpoint that day   says Harbaugh   Extra gears is having the right tool to react to your environment versus being confined by it  In startup life  being equipped to be adjust and be nimble is more powerful than being accurate from the get go  It d be nice if that happens  but there are just too many variables and contingencies that await    Take your rest days   There are times when there were headwinds  packs of dogs chasing her bike or remnants of a tornado swirling near her   Those days nothing really helps  We ve all had those days   whether you re part of a startup or not  The reason I could suck it up and go further is because I had rest days   says Harbaugh   If you research failed cross country rides  the common thread of why people stop is usually fatigue  The guy who is hell bent on 200 miles every day    Harbaugh made herself take every seventh day off   Even if I was in a town I didn t really like   which happened all the time   I stopped and took the day completely off  I did laundry  saw a movie  caught up on writing or read a book  But I didn t bike   says Harbaugh   Taking that time off gave my mind and body rest and variety   and more so  an excitement to get back on the bike  Allocating and taking those conscious breaks keeps 8 hour days turning into 12 hour days  in which only 6 hours   if that   are getting work done  Rest days or hours help prevent that    A rest day doesn t need to be the same day of the week or shared with others   Some startups basically require employees to work on weekends   or prohibit them from doing so  When I d ride  I learned which day   and environment   was going to give me the most rest   says Harbaugh   For example  I d choose Sundays because I really liked sitting and working my way through Sunday s New York Times  I also had my favorite fast food spot   Quizno s   or hotel chain  Holiday Inn  That familiarity was as important as the amount of time I had to rest  I felt connected in new places    There s never a bad day to ride   After Harbaugh made it past Glacier National Park  she renamed her journal   Never A Bad Day to Ride   It reminded her that everybody has bad days and to keep riding because it gets better   I hit some major bad patches  I remember when my phone died completely in Wisconsin  It was Friday night  so there s a lot of drunk driving  and I d just pass these white crosses dotting the road where people had been hit and killed  Not the most encouraging when you re solo  approaching nightfall and without a working cell phone   says Harbaugh   I eventually found a bar with some rooms above it  but it wasn t easy  But I still had fun that day  I think people often mistake a temporary bad patch for a permanent one  There s a fire in production  One of your big customers is grumpy  But there are also the positive feedback on a feature or news of saving customers time in their day  Quite simply  have a channel in Slack or HipChat where you can expose and tally these moments for everyone    When you get a big victory  use it to fill everyone s reservoir   Keep people buoyed by really celebrating the successes  When LaunchDarkly got its first six figure check  I called everybody in the conference room and I projected an image of the check up on the wall   says Harbaugh   I wanted everyone to not just hear how excited I was  but actually see the check and gather together  as the team that helped make it happen    Bringing it All Together  Harbaugh was an experienced technologist before she rode across the United States  but it s that athletic feat that has given her tactics to build software and lead LaunchDarkly better  Among them  break jobs into smaller tasks  Every day starts with zero  Write it down   you can always alter your plan  You can t A B test everything  You re gonna need extra gears  And take your rest days  Lastly  though there will be rough patches   there s never a bad day to build    I remember the home stretch  I had just navigated a nightmare road in Pittsburgh with a narrow potholed shoulder that was hilly and shrouded in dense fog  When I got to town  most hotels were sold out due to a country music concert  so I had slim pickings  Although I was almost there  I wanted to quit   says Harbaugh   But I was three days out   it was the home stretch  I asked myself   Can you do this for 72 hours more   I started thinking about the people who got me there  My sister  who had ridden cross country  My step dad  who had taught me how to ride a bike  My dad  who had ridden 90 miles himself  My mother  who was waiting to ride the final five miles with me  That s when you go from solo rider to peloton  From founder to startup  You get on the saddle  and you ride for yourself and others  That s how you can do anything of lasting value    Photography by Bonnie Rae Mills,"[208 1316 154 908 284 561 721 670 51 863

213,training-dataset/business/10.txt,business,Sam AltmanThe most important story of 2014 that most people ignored was the Chinese economy overtaking the US economy   This is using the purchasing power parity metric  which incorporates differences in the price of goods  but the Chinese economy will overtake on other metrics soon enough    This shouldn t have caught anyone by surprise  US growth has stagnated while Chinese growth has continued to do pretty well  the chart below shows inflation adjusted economic growth rates in China vs  the US since 1978   The US has become less competitive globally for example  other countries have surpassed our education system  and we have structural and demographic challenges other countries don t and that create significant expenses   The historical track record of the largest economy being overtaken by another is not good  Sometimes it s violent   For example  Germany and the UK in 1914  Though neither were the largest in the world  the world was less globalized  They were the largest in the region and very focused on each other   Sometimes it s a long  slow slide of denial into stagnation and decreasing relevance   It s almost unthinkable for most people born in the US in the last 70 or so years for the US not to be the world s superpower  But on current trajectories  we re about to find out what that looks like   1  The current plan seems to be something like  managed decline   or gradual acceptance of reduced importance   The US gets huge advantages from being the world s largest economy  as mentioned earlier  other countries wanting this sometimes leads to major conflict   For example  our currency is the most important currency in the world  and we can do things like run a trillion dollar deficit without anyone getting too concerned  People generally have to buy energy  oil  in our currency  which adds a great deal of support  though we ve already seen the very beginnings of the PetroYuan   Also  we get to have the world s most powerful army   The current business model of the US requires the dollar to be the world reserve currency  though the Chinese currency is rapidly becoming a viable alternative  At some point  China will relax its currency controls  allowing trade and offshore investment to grow rapidly  The Renminbi  RMB  will probably rise in value  though some people think the opposite will happen in the short term  and China will become an important financial center   The most critical question  speaking as a hopeful US citizen  is whether or not it s possible for one country to remain as powerful as another with four times less people  The US has never been the world s largest country by population  but it has been the largest economy  and so it s clearly possible for at least some period of time   How has the US done this  One important way has been our excellence in innovation and developing new technology  A remarkable number of the major technological developments far in excess of our share of the world s population have come from the US in the last century   The secret to this is not genetics or something in our drinking water  We ve had an environment that encourages investment  welcomes immigrants  rewards risk taking  hard work  2   and radical thinking  and minimizes impediments to doing new things  Unfortunately we ve moved somewhat away from this  Our best hope  by far  is to find a way to return to it quickly  Although the changes required to become more competitive will likely be painful  and probably even produce a short term economic headwind  they are critical to make   The US should try very hard to find a way to grow faster   3  I ve written about this in the past  Even if there weren t a competitor in the picture  countries historically don t do well with declining growth  and so it s in our interest to try to continue to keep growth up  It s our standard advice to startups  and it works for organizations at all levels  Things are either growing or dying   The other thing to try to do is figure out a way to coexist with China  Absent some major surprise  China and the US are going to be the world superpowers for some time  The world is now so interconnected that totally separate governments playing by different rules are not going to work  for example  if people can manufacture goods in China without regard for environmental regulations  they ll be cheaper than US goods  but they ll harm the environment for people in the US eventually   Instead of the normal historical path of increasing two way animosity until it erupts in conflict  maybe we can find a way to both work on what we re really good at and have governments that at least partially cooperate   Thanks to Patrick Collison  Matt Danzeisen  especially to Matt  who provided major help   Paul Graham  and Alfred Lin for reading drafts of this    1  As a related sidenote   exceptionalism  in the US has become almost a bad word it s bad to talk about an individual being exceptionally good  and certainly bad to talk about the country as a whole being exceptional  On my last visit to China  the contrast here was remarkable people loved talking about how amazing certain entrepreneurs were  and the work the country as a whole was doing to make itself the best in the world   The other stark contrast is how much harder people in China seem to work than people here  and how working hard is considered a good thing  not a bad thing    2  One thing that I ve found puzzling over the last ten or so years is the anger directed towards people who choose to work hard  This is almost never from actually poor people who work two minimum wage jobs  who work harder than all the rest of us  pretty much  but from middle class people  It s often somewhat subtle  It s so stupid that these people play the startup lottery  What idiots  They should just consult   or  Startups need to stop glorifying young workers that can work all day and night  but the message is clear  My explanation is that this is simply what happens in a low growth  zero sum environment    3  A significant and relevant headwind for US growth is that current US policy often encourages investment and job growth outside the US  domestic companies can borrow at low rates because of 0  Fed lending  build factories  and create jobs  in other countries  and then hold reinvest those profits offshore rather than pay high taxes repatriating their funds,"[213 1011 667 456 537 561 1316 154 1390 71 51]"
219,training-dataset/business/189.txt,business,Sam AltmanI think a lot about how important cheap  safe  and abundant energy is to our future  A lot of problems economic  environmental  war  poverty  food and water availability  bad side effects of globalization  etc  are deeply related to the energy problem   I believe that if you could choose one single technological development to help the most people in the world  radically better energy generation is probably it  Throughout history  quality of life has gone up as the cost of energy has gone down   The 20th century was the century of carbon based energy  I am confident the 22nd century is going to be the century of atomic energy  i e  terrestrial atomic generation and energy relatively directly from the sun s fusion    1  I am unsure how the majority of the 21st century will be powered  but I d like to help get things moving   Although a lot of people are working on solar  I don t think enough people are working on terrestrial based atomic energy  which has major advantages when it comes to cost  density  and predictability   Given the potential importance  I m making an exception to my normal policy of not joining YC boards for Helion Energy and UPower  Both of these companies went through YC about a year ago  Helion is working on fusion and UPower is working on fission  I ve looked at many companies working on both and think these are the two best  I ll be the chairman of both companies and I m also investing in the seed A rounds for both companies   2   Both companies hope to have a test reactor operating in a few years  and both companies are hiring  If you re interested in working on this  please get in touch                        1  I m unsure of is what the split between sun generated  I m just going to call it solar but I use it to include wind and biofuels  and terrestrial generated will be  There will only be one cheapest source of energy  and history suggests whatever that is will be fairly dominant  So it will probably be 80 20 one way or the other    2  I will save my thoughts about traditional technology investors being afraid to touch expensive  long term  high risk high reward projects for another time  A lot of people talk about the need to try new things that are hard but could have huge impact  it s important to not just talk about them but to act  I think it s easier for individual investors to do this than for venture funds  at least given how they are currently structured   I don t think investors are doing nearly enough to fund atomic energy  With the exception of China  new fission development has effectively stopped and very few plants have been built in recent memory  Fission has been a remarkably safe and effective power source while generating 11  of the world s electricity the first time I saw the data on the safety data of fission energy relative to other power sources  I thought there was an error   On the fusion side  only about four US fusion companies have raised venture capital in the past few decades  The big government projects  like NIF and ITER  unfortunately have the feel of peacetime big government projects,"[219 1011 967 982 51 1361 863 213 1316 667 437]"

227,training-dataset/business/1099.txt,business,The Misunderstood  Underestimated  and Neglected Genius of AdvertisingWhen I meet readers they like to ask  What is the topic you learned the most from   or  What was the most surprisingly helpful topic    I have a new answer to both of those questions  Advertising   For a lifetime of business education both academic and self guided  I have overlooked and underestimated Advertising  At University  it lived in the Communications college  far from the Business curriculum   In the startup world  Advertising is viewed as an afterthought  Most startups believe advertising is proof of weakness in the product or distribution strategy   For years  I have been crippled by a self inflicted ignorance of Advertising  something I now believe is one of the few crucial pillars of business knowledge   Along with Strategy  Value Capture  and Distribution   I am eager to fill this gap in my knowledge  now devouring stacks of advertising books in every spare moment   Here are some of the things I ve learned already   Note on this Edition  There are fewer excerpts in this collection  This is because advertisers as a breed write densely and concisely  It would be a disservice to excerpt or attempt to summarize something so well crafted   Advertising as Keystone of Business  Advertising is the closest thing to a keystone trait in business  If advertising is done incredibly well  not much else matters   Shitty product and great advertising  Success   Terrible distribution and great advertising  Success   Poor idea  weak strategy and great advertising  Success   In story after story in these Advertising books  mediocre products with no differentiation from companies with mushy strategies become enormous successes through successful advertising  It is inspiring  infuriating  and ingenious   The Advertiser s Context and Mindset  Advertising is way out at the end of the value chain   the last step before a sale  This often leaves advertisers far removed from the earlier processes in product development and delivery   Additionally  the fact that advertising is often executed by an agency means they re informed after many decisions have already been made   This is true in small and large companies  for different reasons  In large companies  specializations are deeper and communication is much harder  so these groups do not intermingle  In smaller companies that employ agencies  it s much more rare to have employees with an advertiser s skill and mindset   Think about this chain of events   Ideation   Strategy   Branding   Product Development   Merchandising   Distribution   Marketing   Advertising   The last step is advertising  The success of advertising determines sales  which is the ultimate factor of the profitability of the business  Advertising skill is the bottleneck of almost all business   whether or not they realize it   Yet how many decisions throughout the process of ideation  product development  and distribution are considered through the lens of advertising  How often do you consider the opinions of advertisers   This idea first struck me as I was watching Art   Copy  This documentary is a great introduction to the power of advertising  It profiles a handful of the most successful living advertisers   The example that jumped out was Braniff International Airlines  In a commoditized industry  it was the advertising agencies   really Mary Wells Lawrence s  idea to turn Braniff into the  most beautiful airline in the world  which redefined the strategy  product  and marketing in the process of creating great advertising   These people are Kingmakers  You will see them take Tommy Hilfiger from obscurity into overnight success  They created the Got Milk  campaign and put Reagan in office  In 90 minutes you will be fully convinced of the power of advertising   when executed to excellence   This documentary is fantastic  I m going to watch it 5 more times  also available on Netflix   It is full of ideas  inspiration and historical wisdom about advertisers of all different kinds   The Advertiser s Skills and Perspective  David Ogilvy is a legend in the advertising world  His book is one of the most impressive I have ever read by one important metric  value per word   There are whole chapters that may not be relevant  How to get a job in advertising   yet the chapters that are relevant are over flowing with lessons  You will be underlining and note taking constantly   Halfway through his book  Ogilvy on Advertising  it became clear why this was such a crucial aspect of business  No other role in the business world involves such a variety of disciplines   Mastering advertising requires all of the following perspectives   Consumer Psychology   Understanding culture and human needs  Appeal Development  Crafting appeals and products to match  Strategy and Positioning   Establishing a brand amongst competitors  Communication   Clearly reach and invoke action from customers  Sales   Advertising is salesmanship in print media  Market Validation   Tracking effectiveness of messages and value props  Profitability   Advertising must pay for itself over the long term  This blend of talents makes for a unique mind   the kind of person who can influence strategic and product development in helpful ways long before an advertising strategy is typically conceived   This is a great place to start because it is higher level than some other resources  The advice is in a sweet spot  specific enough to feel actionable  without being too involved for the non practitioner  And most importantly  it reveals the complex breadth of the talents that make a great advertiser   Thanks to Brandon Redlinger for suggesting Ogilvy s book   Scientific Advertising  There are various schools of thought in advertising  Creatives take big bold swings at changing culture and perspective  The more calculated and quantified group believes that advertising is a science  not an art   Every scientific advertiser is a direct descendent of Claude Hopkins  author of Scientific Advertising and My Life in Advertising  Hopkins is now long gone  1866 1932   yet his influence carries on   His opinions on the purpose and practice of advertising is roughly summed up by this   The only purpose of advertising is to make sales  It is profitable or unprofitable according to its actual sales      Treat it like a salesman  Force it to justify itself  Compare it to other salesman  Figure its cost and result  Accept no excuses which good salesmen do not make  Then will you will not go far wrong   He is the mind who turned Bissell Vacuums and Palmolive into household names over 100 years ago  By popularizing Pepsodent  he is credited with making tooth brushing a cultural norm   It is incredible to read his frank accounts of turning products into movements  and to absorb his uncompromising beliefs about the power of scientific advertising   I have helped a good many men to wealth and position  In many cases   in most cases   they started practically without money  The advertising had to earn its way  It was the chief factor in the business  often the only reason for success   Reading these books feels like hearing a story from a grandfather  A very intense  very wealthy  very accomplished grandfather  Hopkins spent his entire life in advertising  and his track record is incredible   There is a huge amount to learn from Hopkins  not in spite of his age but because of it  His lessons are timeless and his ideas inspire fresh new lines of thought for anyone in any business  My Life in Advertising is now in my top 10 business books ever read   Scientific Advertising is expanded on and broadened by Tested Advertising Methods  which is much more of a practitioner s guide  The two main topics are crafting appeals and copywriting   the most important skills in advertising  This book is also now in my top 10 best business books   When you sit down to write an ad  a sales email  or to tell your companies  story  your work will be 10x better if you have this book on the desk next to you  It s an incredible resource  with chapters devoted to collecting the explaining successful ads  headlines  appeals  and stories   Thanks also to Brandon Redlinger for suggesting these books   How Advertising Creates Perceived Value  Beyond the scientific  quantified approach to advertising as a medium for sales is the belief that Advertising can create value   perceived value   No one explains that better than Rory Sutherland of Ogilvy   Mather in his notorious TED talk suggested by Natala Constantine  Life Lessons from an Ad Man   As George Lois said in the documentary Art   Copy    Great advertising makes food taste better  makes cars run better  it changes the perception of everything   Good advertising is a form of competitive advantage   related to brand  the ability to create value through perception is something that is impossible for competitors to duplicate  at least in an identical way    Famous Advertising Campaigns  Part of the reason advertising is such a fun topic to learn about is to see the brilliance that has been created  Taking a look at some of the most famous campaigns in history is a great way to find inspiration and see the importance of good advertising   Volkswagen Ads   Treasure trove of counterintuitive genius   Suggested by Shahzad Ahsan   Almost All Apple Ads   So interesting to see new ideas but continuity of the core brand feel   Coca Cola s Long Game   No one builds a brand on slim product differentiation better than Coke   To dig into successful campaigns in the scientific advertising world  simply find the oldest direct response ads you can in newspapers  magazines  and online  They will be the most refined  most perfected  and most profitable  They will almost certainly not be the most beautiful   Further Reading  Each amazing book seems to lead me to another  so I still have a stack of books to get through on this topic that I will be reading immediately  Here is what I plan to get to next  if you are interested   Robert Collier Letterbook

232,training-dataset/business/61.txt,business,Bringing transparency to seed investing   On differentiation  Storytelling goes a long way in fundraising for your company  One of the biggest components of this is differentiating your product   your company from others   Differentiation is very difficult   there are so many entrepreneurs who are doing something similar to you and also so many alternatives that achieve the same results as your product   solution  Even if no one has the exact same product as you  surely if you re solving a problem  there is someone else providing a different means to the same end result  And if there isn t are you really solving a problem  So  differentiating your company well is tough   So it s important to think deeply about this  Take the time to really hammer out a clear story on why your product   company is differentiated  Here are a few areas entrepreneurs ought to think about differentiation     1  Focus on results not features  The top way I see entrepreneurs differentiating their products is via features   Our UX is easier to use than the competition  ABC product is so clunky   Or   we have DEF feature but company XYZ doesn t    Most of the time  features really don t matter  Ultimately  consumers and businesses use products as a means to an end   they want to achieve X faster or cheaper or something  It may be that your user interface makes it easier or faster to accomplish X  But  people don t care about what buttons your product has  They care about that end result  Focus your story around that   Case in point  In the late 90s  Google was something like the 7th or 8th major search engine to emerge  Their feature set was different from Yahoo s   it was just one search box with nothing else on the screen  Although UI was simple  that s not why consumers switched their searches to Google  That s just a feature  Consumers switched because they could get search results a LOT faster   orders of magnitude faster  Consumers didn t have to leave the computer to get a snack while waiting for their search results to load over their dial up modem connection   2  Your results should be 10x better than competitors or alternatives not incremental  This brings me to my next point  When entrepreneurs do focus on presenting results  I find that they often tend to be incremental improvements  In an investor s eyes  incremental improvements are not interesting  This is because incremental results are often not enough to get a consumer or a business to drop everything and make it a priority to switch from what they are already using to your product   solution   In the case of Google  their results were not just a little bit better but an order of magnitude better  E g  Altavista seemed slightly faster than Yahoo  at least to me   but when Google came along  it was a no brainer to use Google all the time   Now  sometimes  you may need reframe your story here  It s not always possible for all your numbers to be an order of magnitude better  You may need to pick a different result to differentiate on  For example  let s say you develop a new kind of airplane with less 2  less drag  This  in itself  may be a small number  But it could have an order of magnitude of effect on your gas costs for the plane or whatnot  It s important to think about what axis you want to compete on   3  You may need to differentiate your company on something other than your product  This brings me to my next point  Sometimes  it s just not possible to compete at all on any numbers being an order of magnitude better  Not all great products are an order of magnitude better  And  that s ok  But  it means that you need to differentiate on something else   You will also need to do this if you re in an industry where people can t look under the hood and believe that your results are actually better en mass  For example  lead generation  There are so many lead generation startups  I had one too    And they all say they provide awesome leads  And they all say their leads are 10x more cost effective than everyone else  How is this possible  Who is telling the truth  Probably everyone   for certain customers  specific lead generation platforms and services are better than others  But it s not possible for an investor to verify this en masse  so many investors will pass outright  because they don t believe this differentiator is true and won t be able to prove it   For businesses like these where an investor cannot actually verify your differentiator  you will need to get creative in your story  Usually  the best way to do this is to incorporate your personal story  If you have unique insights or domain experience  maybe this is what you use to differentiate your company from others  Don t use a story that your competitors can use  For example  in the lead generation industry  a story I hear all the time is about how  Martha runs a flower shop and didn t have customers  Then awesome lead gen platform ABC came in and got her customers   All of your competitors   alternatives are telling that same story  Your story should be unique to you   a story that none of your competitors or alternatives can tell   To come up with such a differentiated story  in many cases  you may want to make it about yourself or your personal insights that are unique  What is interesting about you  And why are  you  doing this lead generation business  If you can t think of anything  spend the time to think long and hard   Here s an example that a CEO gave me the other day  He s building a company in a vertical that is pretty crowded  He said   Let s take a step back   before we dive into my business  I want to tell you a bit about my life  My mom was a single mom  And I grew up poor  And I could not get into college  And everyone wrote me off as a loser  And so I had to take a job after high school to make ends meet  And  I ended up in ABC industry taking the only job I could get  From there  I did XYZ  and eventually I realized from working in this business that a  I wanted to prove myself   that I was not just this poor boy with no future  And b  that I knew more about the ABC industry than most people in the world  and here are my insights on it  And this is why I m starting this company    His story was incredibly compelling  Even though his product insights were not unique  he was able to differentiate his company from many of the other ones I ve heard pitch  because I believed he knew more than other people about this industry   4  Think about future differentiation    Once you ve established why your company   product is different  think about how you ll continue to be different  Investors call this your moat  You don t need it now   most companies are not really defensible when they first start   but investors want to know how you think about this and how you ll work towards this   Your strongest story will be about how you ll continue to keep your company ahead of the pack  For example  if you have data that feeds into your algorithms to make them stronger  then your story is about growing your data access so that you ll continue to improve your algorithms  If your story is about network effects of people on your platform  tout that story   But there are a lot of stories about improving your product that I hear from entrepreneurs that are pretty weak  Saying  for example  you ll continue to improve the user experience on your platform  while may be true and important  is NOT compelling  Investors would expect you to continue to improve the product  and any newcomers or future competitors would do the same  Your head start is likely minimal  so it s moot  Any competitor can come in and build a better product than you or play catch up with a better UI   In most cases  where you don t have network effects in your product or viral loops or whatnot   and most companies don t   you ll need to tell a story about a thesis that you have  A thesis  by definition  needs to be both compelling and arguable  In other words  a good thesis will get some people excited and passionate to join your journey but will be alienating to others  Your job isn t to get all investors to like you   your job is to find investors who believe in your vision of the world  This is hard to do  because as a fundraising entrepreneur  it s tempting to want to tell a story that everyone will like  But  I m saying you shouldn t   you should come up with a thesis that at least a few people love and most people completely disagree with   5  Don t differentiate on price  Lastly  don t try to differentiate on price  Price is icing on a cake but is not the cake itself  Your product should be differentiated in other ways  and it s nice if it s cheaper  But it shouldn t only be cheaper  That s the easiest way for another company to compete with you   Good luck   Fundraising is a nebulous process that I aim to make more

241,training-dataset/product/1011.txt,product,Write or fade away as a designerEvery week a new article comes out preaching to designers the necessity of learning to code  sales  or  insert new skill here   If you don t learn one of these indispensable skills  your career is bound to crash and burn  Why  Because of the looming AI insurgence or some other wacky theory   While these articles may be accurate  in a very far future   the main reason we spill these warnings and encourage the learning of new skills is either to earn extra cash  feel more secure in our own job  or to avoid a sense of imposter syndrome   The real question should be  What skill provides the biggest gains for the least amount of effort  And the answer is  Writing   Don t believe me  Just read what 5 top designers had to say about the importance of writing and the effects it s had on their careers   Eyal Zuri  Writing doesn t have to be serious  Eyal Zuri is best known for Muzli  which recently joined InVision LABS  partially due to Zuri s consistent blogging  He publishes around 16 articles a month after looking for new ways to grow Muzli  Zuri quickly realized that creating great content is an easy way to generate more traffic   This article generated a lot of buzz  causing significant growth in all of our channels  It s funny  lighthearted  and not binding  which are keys to a good article    I don t really write  My articles are based on inspiration only   Zuri said   It allows me to create a relatively large amount of content that people love to consume    Related  Why writing should be part of your design portfolio  Paul Jarvis  Write to boost doing what you love  After 20 years of designing  veteran designer Paul Jarvis spends most of his time writing and teaching today  This isn t surprising  since writing has made him  400 000 in just 18 months  In fact  his most recent course sold out in minutes after writing just 1 newsletter   Jarvis made excuses for years before deciding to blog    To be honest  I made every excuse in the book to not write for years  I kept telling myself I wasn t a writer  so I had no business writing   Jarvis said   Then I realized that was a total BS excuse  All it takes to be a writer is to start writing  That s it  So that s what I did starting my first book and a regular writing practice for articles  It snowballed from there  and now I spend as much or more time writing as I do designing    So how does a designer  who isn t a writer  become such a damn good one  Jarvis  who still doesn t consider himself a good writer today  says  Just write for the audience you want to have     Help them with the things they struggle with  worry about  or wish they knew more about  Don t write for other designers unless they re your target audience  and they probably aren t   Jarvis advises   According to Jarvis  his posts work because they aren t specifically selling something    My articles are entertaining and educational about a specific point  for a specific audience  so that I could paint a picture of what they were struggling with  help them in some small way  and then mention that if they needed further help  my paid courses were available    Before Jarvis the teacher  Jarvis the designer wrote posts for potential design clients  like this one    As my job changed to more of a teacher  articles that spoke directly to the pain I was trying to solve with the courses I teach help me sell those courses like this one  used for Chimp Essentials  or this one  used for Creative Class     Nick Babich  Writing brings opportunities  Nick Babich  developer designer hybrid  usually writes research packed posts  based on his work experience   Babich tries to publish 6 articles  between 5 and 7 minutes long  every month  Why between 5 and 7 minutes  Because this way you only need to write the most important details  and also  because you don t want readers to get bored   Like Jarvis  Babich s writing has provided him with a multitude of opportunities  such as a speaking gig at Push Conference    It was such an amazing event  I had a lot of inspiration and new ideas from this experience  and most of them will be in my future posts   he said   Matt West  Write about passions that outweigh the fear of writing  Matt West  author of HTML5 Foundations  tries to publish between 2 and 3 articles a month  but sometimes he goes for long periods of time without writing anything  when there just isn t anything to share   While there are loads of books on how to improve your writing  West simply focuses on reading a lot    Read the work of writers you admire  and pay attention to their use of language  how they structure sentences and how they present their ideas  You can learn a lot by simply surrounding yourself with great work    For a while  West lost his passion to write  when writing became more of a chore  It wasn t until he was presented with the opportunity to author a book on HTML5 that his desire to share his knowledge outweighed his dislike of writing   West recommends writing about topics you re passionate about  not only will you do your best work  but you ll also feel like you aren t doing work at all    Don t try to please everyone  be opinionated  and stay focused on your core idea  If you put something out into the world  and nobody disagrees with you  then you re probably not saying anything worthwhile    Andrew Graunke  Director of Design at Toptal  Toptal s Design Director Andrew Graunke connects the world s top designers with businesses looking to hire  Graunke s favorite part of writing is how it allows you to connect with new people    By proposing a new design for Crunchbase  I was able to open a public dialogue with Crunchbase CEO Jager McConnell  who commented   loved your blog post  Lots of good ideas in there many of which depended on us building the search list functionality we just launched with Pro  Exciting times ahead     While this may not seem like a huge deal to outsiders  it certainly does to Graunke    The work I do takes buy in from all parties  and even the smallest opportunities look like the biggest opportunities to me   he said   Will Jager McConnell leverage our Toptal network to build out design and dev teams  This one s yet to be seen  and the hashtag s on me    These are just some of the examples of designers getting great results by writing  I couldn t interview myself but I got my current job as the Lead Editor of the design blog at Toptal by one of the founders of Toptal reading one of my articles on Medium and reaching out to me   Challenge yourself to write  These are just a few examples of designers reaping great results from writing  Now  it s your turn   Perhaps you can begin by leaving a thoughtful comment on someone else s article   From there  challenge yourself to write an article of your own  Then write one more and another and another  You get the picture   The most difficult part is starting  so don t wait until you find the perfect idea  And don t edit while you write  or you ll drive yourself crazy   The more you write  the easier it gets   To get started  ask yourself

246,training-dataset/product/630.txt,product,Understanding User Psychology  The Psychology of Persuasion This is the second post in myseries  If you haven t already  make sure to check out the first post  Meet Your Happy Chemicals   When looking to understand user psychology in order to design better product experiences  Robert Cialdini s seminal work  Influence  The Psychology of Persuasion   is a classic read  Robert Cialdini brings to bear his years of research on influence to detail the 6 weapons of influence leveraged by compliance practitioners  salesmen  car dealers  fund raisers  to get you to say yes to whatever they are selling  These same tactics can be leveraged in designing product experiences to help delight users as well as drive them to our desired product behaviors The reason the tactics are so effective is due to fixed action patterns  which are automatic responses in humans to certain behavior  These fixed action patterns exist because they are a very efficient form of behavior that allow us to act without thinking  thus minimizing brain strain  Many simple examples of this exist  For example  a mailed out coupon that provided no saving  due to a printing error  produced just as many customer responses as the one that actually provided the discount Let s walk through each of the 6 weapons of influence and how they can be leveraged in digital product design Reciprocation recognizes that people feel indebted to those who do something for them or give them a gift  There is generally a distaste for those who make no effort to reciprocate and thus we will often reciprocate simply to avoid being seen as one of them  You ll often see Hare Krishna society members give a free gift of a flower before asking for a donation  which helped them to effectively raise far more than other groups due to this principle of reciprocation Social apps regularly leverage this principle  encouraging you to like  favorite  or recommend the content of another user  which often elicits a subsequent reciprical response from the recipient to return the favor  This not only makes both users feel good  but drives further app engagement from both actors After making a choice or stating a commitment  either orally or in writing  both personal and interpersonal pressures drive us to behave consistently with it even after the initial motivation is no longer there  This is both due to our culture highly valuing personal consistency as well enabling us to avoid having to think after we ve made a choice  For example  a group of folks were asked to wear a cancer awareness button for a week  Most thought it was a harmless request and complied  Some time later these same people were asked to donate to help fight cancer  And this group donated much more than the control group since it had become a small piece of their identity Habit building apps often drive you to share your goals with your friends  family  or co workers to drive behavior through this exact principle of public commitment and consistency When someone is uncertain about a course of action  they tend to look at those around them to guide their decisions and actions  They want to know what everyone else is doing  especially their peers  For example  the canned laughter tracks you see on TV are very effective at causing viewers to laugh longer and more often  Bartenders similarly see they get more tips when they seed the tip jar with a few dollars Web services frequently use social proof to spur user action in their experiences  Whether it s a warm invite from a friend encouraging you to join a service that they are already using  or an article with 50 likes from your friends encouraging you to check it out  social proof is a very compelling principle to take advantage of to give your users confidence in their next action People are easily persuaded by other people that they know and like  There are many dimensions that spur us liking others  including physical attractiveness  similarity  compliments from them  frequency of contact  and their association with other people we already like All forms of product advertising and imagery take advantage of this by trying to show both attractive people as well as people just like you using the service to drive you to want to do so as well People respect authority and want to follow the lead of real experts  Giving the appearance of authority increases the likelihood of compliance with requests even if the authority is illegitimate  Business titles  impressive clothing  and even fancy cars lend credibility to an individual s authority Many business products today try to establish their brand as a thought leader and expert in their industry to build credibility and authority with their potential prospects to encourage them to try their product The thought of losing something motivates us more than the thought of gaining something of similar value  As such  perceived scarcity will generate demand  Frenzies over the latest holiday toy is a classic example of this Apps create scarcity in a variety of ways  whether it s limited time promotions  the scarcity of rare virtual goods in games  or messaging oriented around losing an opportunity I hope this helps illustrate how understanding Robert Cialdini s 6 weapons of influence are helpful for product designers to build better product experiences that ultimately encourage our desired user behavior For those interested  I encourage you to read more from Robert Cialdini in Influence  The Psychology of Persuasion,"[246 982 736

253,training-dataset/business/995.txt,business,Reflections on Being a Startup MomI ve  leaned back   And I m okay with it  Sort of   As the first teammate to have a baby while working at Buffer  I was able to create our initial family leave policy before I used it  Even that wasn t enough to prepare me for the reality of being a working mom   Going into motherhood  I had a lot of grandiose ideas  preconceived notions and expectations  The biggest of which was that I d be able to jump back into my role without skipping a beat     After all  Sheryl Sandberg did it   she leaned in and kicked ass  right  Why couldn t I   All the tiny things that add up  It turns out there are so many things you just don t anticipate  Things other parents don t tell you  or  well  they do and you just don t hear them    Things like juggling breastfeeding physical recovery pumping cleaning  working laundry eating groceries soothing a crying baby  figuring out first time mommyhood and so many other tiny things add up to a huge mental and physical load   Pumping alone takes more time than I ever expected  Put the parts together  pump  somehow balancing and maybe getting a few emails typed during   clean and store the milk  Easily 20 30 minutes  Then do it again in a few hours  Then again   This phase can last for a few months to a year    My husband and I were lucky that we were able to have a grandparent babysit for one day a week  and then had a nanny for another three days   We paid  1 000 a month for this arrangement  and with my fairly rigid meeting schedule  timezones can be a bit tricky on a global team  it was looking like I might need even more nanny time for my growing  busy little boy   I know I m one of the lucky ones  I would have had to pay double in childcare to cover the time responsibilities I had in my role  Honestly  the cost was more than the raise I received from becoming a manager at Buffer   I was seeing less of my child  even though I d been given the gift of working from home     Still  this wasn t a bad scenario  I know I m one of the lucky ones  I can t imagine how difficult this is for folks who work outside the home  don t have the generous compensation standards of Buffer  or have multiple kids       childcare    Only about a fifth of moms get fully paid maternity time off  and some employees can be legally denied their job back if they

was torn between two ways to contribute  and I looked forward to one slightly more than the other  individual contributor  Writing blog posts  organizing things  Things that offered more flexibility   I had never worked as a manager before  so many things were new when I moved into that role in early 2016  I dove head first into all the leadership training and managing books I could consume   I could have upped my game  But at heart  it was not my life s ambition to be a great manager  I loved my team and wanted them to have the best manager  which is what drove me  I didn t necessarily do it for myself   Was it my fault   Things came to a head this summer when our co founders Leo and Joel felt the community team needed a bit of a reorganization   The rest of the community team joined Buffer s marketing area  and I joined the People team in a new role focused on the Open blog and internal communication and team building   Part of me wonders if my  distraction  as a mother led to some mistakes in leading the team that caused these changes   I m not sure that s the case  there were a lot of reasons for the switch   but it s still present in my heart   I leaned back  and still wrestle with feelings of failure   So I leaned into the individual contributor role instead  And in essence  I leaned back in my career   I stepped back from a lead role  I even took a pay cut  though we saved more than the pay cut in childcare costs  which further emphasized the traditional perception of payment   what you re worth what you re contributing   your success   I wrestled with feeling like a failure  like I took the  easy  way out and I m simply a coward  Like I m just lazy  Traditional business wisdom says you must move up   I m happier in this new role  though I still wrestle with these feelings  I want to feel like I m not a failure  like I m still valued and valuable to the company   The logical part of me knows  I ve found a way that I can take care of my child and work full time  which has long been my dream  I m striving to pour more of myself and more effort into this role than I have in anything else   perhaps to fight off those evil voices that tell me I ve failed   Is it possible to  have it all    I don t know if it s possible to lean in and be the very best at what I am doing without adding more hours to my workweek and taking away from my family time   even at a company that is keenly focused on bringing your whole self to work and evolving the culture of work   Perhaps there is a difference I must come to grips with between  having it all  and  doing it all   Right now  I just can t  do it all    I know my heart won t allow me to settle and feel unchallenged  But working toward a lead role where I m perhaps not best suited at the moment doesn t feel like the right fit either   For now  I ll keep pushing the edges  of my limits  of the role  of motherhood  no matter what so I can be the very best I can be in these areas  and see what becomes of it   I d love to hear from other parents who are primary caregivers and working at the same time  What are your days like  Are you leaning in  leaning back or something else altogether  Are any of these feelings familiar to you,"[253 1145 684 1316 1025 51 609 1174 1073 125 456]"
259,training-dataset/business/972.txt,business,The  Work from Home  Dream Doesn t Work   BackchannelThe  Work from Home  Dream Doesn t Work Technology didn t kill the office  Instead it made coworking spaces even more important in today s gig economy world   When siblings Jonathan Smalley and Melanie Charlton began brainstorming a startup in her Annapolis basement in 2014  they were unwittingly following in the footsteps of Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard  the pair who plotted the trajectory of their namesake company  Silicon Valley  and ultimately the zeitgeist from the splendid isolation of their Palo Alto garage  But Smalley and Charlton chose a different path  relocating to Washington  D C  expressly to join the city s first WeWork outpost   We had been working from home  alone   recalls Charlton   Once we moved in  immediately everything began to change    They weren t looking to change the world  their firm  Brilliant Communications  later shortened to the vowel challenged Brllnt  would design the apps and sites and services for those who did  So they set out to meet their neighbors through liberally dispensing help  advice  and round after round of Nintendo s Mario Golf paired with WeWork s infamous free beer   What followed reads like a parody of millennial startup culture   Smalley the salesman in his cutaway collared shirts  Charlton the chic creative lead  her Shiba Inu  Cinna  starring in the annual  Dogs of WeWork  calendar   but it worked  They met 400 people in the office that year  including nearly half their clients  many of whom sat literally down the hall  They acquired a neighboring three person firm the next year  began pitching for larger business with a trio of others  and poached WeWork s own community manager to coordinate their efforts  By last summer  Brllnt had quadrupled in size to 16 people  with another half dozen freelancers on call    Like anything else  the space is what you make of it   says Smalley   If you want to meet people and forge relationships  you can do that   otherwise  it s just an office  Our approach all along was to build a community inside    Brllnt s symbiotic relationship with WeWork hints at a much larger shift in how we organize work  and where  The startup s choice of a host was not coincidental  With more than 80 000 members spread across 112 locations in 32 cities worldwide  WeWork represents something new in the annals of the office  a talent pool with the scope and scale of a multinational corporation whose collective brain is there for the picking  Whether it justifies its  16 billion valuation  it s already one of the biggest beneficiaries of two trends driving the unbundling   and rebundling   of creative work   The first trend is how the shared office and the network have replaced the solo entrepreneur in her garage as the incubators for new companies and ideas   Coworking  didn t exist a decade ago  and today there are nearly a million people globally working alongside peers who aren t necessarily their colleagues  Workers in these spaces consistently report making more connections  learning skills faster  and feeling more inspired and in control than their cubicle dwelling counterparts inside large companies  They also have different expectations from cloud workers content to commute from their couch    They want connectivity  they want density  and they want fluidity   the ability to move quickly from role to role   says Jonathan Ortmans  president of the Global Entrepreneurship Network and a senior fellow at the Kauffman Foundation   I think all three things lend themselves especially well to shared work environments    The second  more powerful trend is the steadily climbing number of freelance  independent  contingent  and temporary workers   more than 53 million Americans at last count  including 2 8 million freelance business owners  Survey research by the economists Lawrence Katz and Alan Krueger suggests that nearly all of the 10 million jobs created between 2005 and 2015 fall under this heading  attesting to the rise of the  gig economy   This structural change is exhilarating if you re armed with a laptop  Obamacare  and a high hourly rate  not so much if your family needs a steady paycheck   This stems from the fact that corporations are quietly hollowing out  A third of the average company s workforce was contingent or contractual in 2014  according to the supply management firm Ardent Partners  which expects this percentage to rise to 45 percent this year  At the opposite end of the spectrum  solo entrepreneurs have steadily increased spending on freelancers  In 2013  the last year for which IRS data is available   contract workers comprised 36 percent of sole proprietors  labor costs  up from 20 percent a decade earlier   As a result  entrepreneurs have more freedom than ever in assembling talented teams  as Brllnt s founders would attest  The trick is finding them   then vetting  negotiating with  working with  and ultimately paying them  And this has to happen somewhere   we can t all be digital nomads   WeWork and its forerunners literally sit at the convergence of these trends  Rather than going to work at a  job  with your  colleagues  in an  office   your workplace becomes the local embodiment of what the McKinsey Global Institute has dubbed  talent platforms    the online exchanges connecting people to projects  talent  and resources  In typical McKinsey fashion  the firm estimates that these platforms   including everything from Uber to Upwork and LinkedIn   could add  2 7 trillion to global GDP by 2025  The next target for disruption is the office itself   Why is this happening now  The one word answer is technology  The slightly longer explanation comes from the economist Ronald Coase and his Nobel Prize winning work on the nature of the firm  When the  transaction costs  of contracting with talent are high   as they were in 1937  when he formulated his theory   companies hire and compensate employees internally  producing post war behemoths like General Motors or IBM  But when they re low and falling  due to the rise of the Internet and the collapse of organized labor  you get 50 million gig workers and counting   One result is that new kinds of organizations appear   smaller  ad hoc teams that are loosely joined and agile   along with new institutions to support them  This is where companies like WeWork come into play  by adding a physical space in which potential coworkers  clients  and partners can cross paths  and by offering services that make it easier for them to connect   WeWork  it s worth noting  is neither the world s largest office space as a service chain nor the most profitable   that would be Britain s Regus  worth roughly a third as much on paper  WeWork s great innovation was to convince companies of all sizes that sharing an office with hundreds or even thousands of strangers was an opportunity instead of a liability  Today  a tenth of the Fortune 500 maintains at least a part time presence there  totaling more than 11 000 members nominally belonging to the likes of Microsoft  McKinsey  Salesforce  and Dell  Once paranoid  corporate tenants have at last grown comfortable rubbing shoulders in the mix   Management consultants have evangelized for years about business  ecosystems   As in the food chain  even apex predators are enmeshed in a complex web of partners  suppliers  customers and prey  But until the advent of shared workspaces  these relationships rarely manifested in the workplace  unless you were a consultant   Today  you might meet a client or investor while pouring yourself a mimosa  tomorrow  she might invite you to work out of her office   This is already the case in Holland  where one of the country s largest insurers has taken the unusual step of welcoming strangers inside  A few years ago  Interpolis partnered with the Dutch free coworking chain Seats2Meet to share spaces within its buildings  The first  located inside its headquarters and furnished with vintage carousel horses  has become a popular outpost for visiting customers  alumni  and curious employees   It s a place where my colleagues can meet people from the outside and immediately build something with them   says Bob van Leeuwen  the Interpolis strategist who conceived the project   Though it s fun to imagine your future co founder might be sitting behind you  most of us can t afford to wait  Which is why WeWork  Seats2Meet  and others are building their own talent platforms to compete with LinkedIn  gambling that curated propinquity will trump the latter s size  and degrading signal to noise ratio   At WeWork  for example  community managers frequently consult the company s own social network to assist members in finding the right UX designer   which is how Brllnt met several of its clients  As machine learning and social network analysis tools such as Conspire and Collaboration ai are brought to bear on these networks  it s not hard to imagine algorithmic matchmakers spotting these latent connections well in advance   Because as Brllnt s co founders will tell you  the value of shared workspaces stems from face to face conversations with your peers   As we ve scaled our business  we ve managed to scale our partnerships  with other firms   Smalley says   They ve given us insight into problems we had to later face   According to one survey of coworkers  84 percent had consulted with fellow members  60 percent had created new friendships  and nearly half  46 percent  had  innovated  in collaboration with another member  Working together makes you smarter   One reason startups and soloists are leaving their garages  basements  and office spaces is the increasing strength and ease of digital workflow tools  which make it possible for one to work from anywhere   thus inspiring them to rethink where they should work  Between Slack  HipChat  Dropbox  and Asana  we re living in the golden age of hyper intuitive collaboration tools  But what s been missing are equally intuitive apps for everything else   negotiating who does what for how much  ensuring the work gets done  that deadlines are met  people get paid  and the tax man is satisfied  That s especially true of tasks unique to partnerships that dissolve as quickly as they form   As Stowe Boyd  a consultant and futurist who s worked with Microsoft  Google  and IBM  among others  sees it  most of today s collaboration tools are outdated  and leave out key parts of the process  For example   the trickiest part   negotiation   is handled over email or a telephone call and never captured in the project itself   Building a platform that does all of that while obscuring enough of the underlying complexity to be useful is a lot harder than writing another chatbot   The largest such network to date belongs to Upwork  the freelance marketplace created from the 2014 merger of Elance and oDesk  With ten million members earning more than  1 billion annually in gross annual billings  of which they tithe 10 percent   Upwork has invested heavily in matchmaking  monitoring  payment  and managing reputations  gradually compressing its average time to hire from three days to three hours   We re online dating for businesses and freelancers  except we know what happens after they meet   says Rich Pearson  its senior vice president for marketing   We know how many people they hired  what skills they actually used  and what their performance rating was    Pearson imagines managing  private talent clouds  on behalf of customers who could bring reinforcements aboard with a click  rather than after a background check   He d better move fast   Work Market already does this on behalf of thousands of customers  including Walgreens and Cisco   The idea should appeal to entrepreneurs and corporate behemoths alike   Deloitte  for example  is building what chief talent officer Mike Preston calls  bench strength    a thousands strong reserve of expert alumni  niche talents  and part timers who can be summoned in a pinch  Given the churn of a firm its size  225 000 people worldwide   Deloitte has taken the enlightened view that its true workforce extends into both the past and future of its present employees   Then there s the question of how to provide benefits to pop up ensembles of workers  TaskRabbit co founder Kevin Busque is tackling aspects of this challenge with his new startup  Guideline Technologies  The goal is to first radically simplify retirement plans for small  to medium sized businesses and then untether them from employers altogether  To that end  Guideline has partnered with Vanguard  the low fee mutual fund company  created its own easy to use app  and added a solo 401 k  option in which workers can sponsor themselves   Another company angling to reinvent back office functions is Justworks  a New York City based startup striving to shoehorn the legal requirements of HR into an app   Our goal is to become the  employment layer  for Americans   says CEO Isaac Oates   On top are millions of businesses  and on bottom are thousands of governments  And in between is a spaghetti of relationships    Left unsaid  the company that can untangle that   or at least sufficiently hide it   has a multi billion dollar business on its hands  Justworks  Guideline  and their many competitors are all chasing the same grail  an Amazon Web Services inspired model allowing virtually anyone to run industrial strength HR and accounting from their phones   For a firm like Brllnt   which relies on Slack and runs on JustWorks   the flexibility provided by these tools has already influenced how  where  and with whom they work  Rather than obviating the need to cram into a fishbowl  today s business climate made sharing a workspace that much more attractive  Despite the hype  technology didn t end up killing the office  It enhanced and reinvented it  instead   This essay was made possible with the generous support of the John S  and James L  Knight Foundation,"[259 801 1390 284 1316 154 51 561 64 883 609]"
266,training-dataset/business/1112.txt,business,A Dozen Things I ve Learned from Elon Musk About Business and InvestingElon Musk is a classic missionary founder who is more interested in changing the world and creating enduring businesses than just the financial rewards that may flow to him from the product or service  Mercenaries may sometimes succeed financially  but they do not bring as much lasting value to their communities  What a city and nation wants in terms of economic development are businesses that produce jobs  innovative products and services  a better quality of life and which add to the tax base over the long term  I would rather have an Expedia  Zillow or Tableau in my community than a startup sold early in its potential life by the founder for tens of millions of dollars or even  1 billion  which then slowly  or quickly  disappears   To cover the situation where a reader of this blog has been living in a cave  set out below is some background information on Musk before getting to his quotes and my own thoughts   Elon Musk is a South African born entrepreneur  engineer  and investor   Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start up Zip2 to Compaq  He taught himself to program and at 12 he sold a game called Blastar  At age 17  in 1989  he moved to Canada and attended Queen s University   In 1992 he move to the US to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania  He graduated with an undergraduate degrees in economics and physics    In March 1999  Musk co founded X com  an online financial services and e mail payment company  that eventually merged with Confinity  which operated a service called PayPal   He is the founder  CEO and CTO of SpaceX and the Chief Executive Officer  Product Architect and Chairman of Tesla Motors   1   People should be less risk averse when there s not much at risk     When something is important enough you do it even if the odds are not in your favor   Musk s many successes in business and life are an excellent way to explain   1  why financial returns from venture capital and research and development follow a power law and  2  why the creation of startups that are tape measure home runs in terms of success is enabled by other startups which fail   The potential distribution of financial returns from the creation of a new businesses that is  0 to n  is convex  I am not going to go very deep into the nature of convexity because most of my readers will stop reading  If you do get bored anyway skip to number 2 below  In the Notes below  two people write on the nature of convexity    In  nance  convexity is a broadly understood and non speci c term for nonlinear behavior of the price of an instrument as a function of evolving markets  Oftentimes   nancial convexities are associated with some sort of optionality embedded in the instrument     The trouble is that convexity involves a whole bunch of seriously geeky math and computer models and normal people probably don t want to go there   I don t even want to go there     Investments which are instead  1 to n  are not convex  Nassim Taleb writes   Payoffs from  convex investments like venture capital and  research are from Extremistan  they follow a power law type of statistical distribution  with big  near unlimited upside but  because of optionality  limited downside   In other words  convexity is about bets that reflect an asymmetric possible distribution of outcomes  Taleb writes   Convexity propositions should be embraced   concave ones  avoided like the plague   The billionaire investor Sam Zell puts it in more understandable terms for an ordinary investor or business person in this way   Listen  business is easy  If you ve got a low downside and a big upside  you go do it  If you ve got a big downside and a small upside  you run away      This matrix below represents my attempt to better explain investments which are convex   Determining whether rights to a potentially convex investment are available at an attractive price requires expected value thinking  If you overpay for an investment which has convexity you are not making a bet with positive expected value  This is why the best venture capitalists and entrepreneurs like Musk and Jeff Bezos are involved in areas and technologies before they become popular  Once the crowds arrive in a given area of investment an investor must invariably overpay for any investments  competition becomes very significant and potential investments cease to be opportunities and instead become efficient ways to destroy wealth   When you encounter a convex financial or other opportunity with little downside and very big upside  it is with your circle of competence and it is under priced  you should bet BIG  If the big convex bet is financial you only need to be right once in a lifetime to be wealthy since it is magnitude of success and not frequency of success that determines the desirability of the result  This is the so called  Babe Ruth Principle   When you are looking for convex bets  often the best place to look is in areas where you encounter significant complex adaptive systems  Investing is a probabilistic activity  Areas where financial outcomes can potentially be impacted by positive Black Swans can be significant opportunities   Convex propositions can be found most anywhere if you know how to look for them and Musk is certainly someone who knows how to find them  Discovering convexity is made easier if you want to do things that are uncommon and bold  The convexity is in a sidecar if you will with people who think big and differently  As an example  going to Mars is very important to Musk  When he and Jeff Bezos started their quest to substantially lower the cost of launch using unconventional methods  the bets were convex  A similar bet would not be nearly as convex now that they have has proven their approaches are viable  This is why venture investors and founders inevitably have both spectacular results and many failures  Taleb writes that the process works   by negative information  reducing the space of what we do by knowledge of what does not work  For that we need to pay for negative results   If someone tries to take failure out of the process  innovation will cease  This is why Jeff Bezos recently wrote is a shareholder letter    One area where I think we are especially distinctive is failure  I believe we are the best place in the world to fail  we have plenty of practice    and failure and invention are inseparable twins  To invent you have to experiment  and if you know in advance that it s going to work  it s not an experiment    As for assessing the  risk  of failure  Musk talks about in his quotes  how risky is something if you can t conceive of failing  This passage from Jim Cantrell who was on the SpaceX founding team is enlightening    He is by far the single smartest person that I have ever worked with   period  I can t estimate his IQ but he is very very intelligent  And not the typical egg head kind of smart  He has a real applied mind  He literally sucks the knowledge and experience out of people that he is around    I am going to suggest that he is successful not because his visions are grand  not because he is extraordinarily smart and not because he works incredibly hard  All of those things are true  The one major important distinction that sets him apart is his inability to consider failure  It simply is not even in his thought process  He cannot conceive of failure and that is truly remarkable  It doesn t matter if it s going up against the banking system  Paypal   going up against the entire aerospace industry  SpaceX  or going up against the US auto industry  Tesla   He can t imagine NOT succeeding and that is a very critical trait that leads him ultimately to success  He and I had very similar upbringings  very similar interests and very similar early histories  He was a bit of a loner and so was I  I recently wrote an op ed piece for Space News where I also suggest that his ruthlessly efficient way to deploy capital is another great reason for his success  He can almost smell the right way through a problem and he drives his staff and his organization hard to achieve it  The results speak for themselves   In the end I think that we are seeing a very fundamental shift in the way our world takes on the big challenges facing humanity and Elon s Way as I call it will be considered the tip of the spear    Someone who knows Musk well once told me that to understand Musk you really have to understand how badly he wants to go to Mars  They said they have seen him turn down chances to earn more profit since he believed he could get to Mars faster by doing so  This person said to me   If you want to predict what Musk will do  ask yourself  Will this help him get to Mars faster   Existing providers of launch did not think they would encounter anyone who thinks this way  To illustrate this  0 to n  approach to investing and life  it is useful to look at something that Musk recently said    Essentially what we re saying is we re establishing a cargo route to Mars  It s a regular cargo route  You can count on it  It s going happen every 26 months  Like a train leaving the station  And if scientists around the world know that they can count on that  and it s going to be inexpensive  relatively speaking compared to anything in the past  then they will plan accordingly and come up with a lot of great experiments    If someone thinks like Musk or Bezos and they are right about their investments  your competing business that did not make the same bets can be in big trouble  This is what happened to Blackberry  An anecdote about Musk that was recently in a Bloomberg article further illustrates the point    For France s Le Gall  Europe s contemptuous inability to take Musk seriously dates back years  He remembers a conference in Vietnam about a decade ago where the billionaire  showed up in torn jeans and with a plastic bag  He told us   the chiefs of the three biggest rocket launchers worldwide    I am here and you are dead   One of us replied   you talk  we launch   Had we known    2  Focus on something that has high value to someone else  be really rigorous in making that assessment  because natural human tendency is wishful thinking    Great companies are built on great products    There are really two things that have to occur in order for a new technology to be affordable to the mass market  One is you need economies of scale  The other is you need to iterate on the design  You need to go through a few versions    You ve got to make sure that whatever you re doing is a great product or service  It has to be really great  To go back to what I was saying earlier  where if you re a new company   unless it s like some new industry or new market that hasn t   if it s an untapped market  then you have more ability to   the standard is lower for your product or service  but if you re entering anything where there s an existing marketplace  against large entrenched competitors  then your product or service needs to be much better than theirs  It can t be a little bit better  because then you put yourself in the shoes of the consumer and they say why would you buy it as a consumer  You re always going to buy the trusted brand unless there s a big difference  A lot of times an entrepreneur will come up with something that is only slightly better  and it can t just be slightly better  It s got to be a lot better    If you re trying to create a company  It s like baking a cake  You have to have all the ingredients in the right proportion   There is a lot to unpack in this set of statements by Musk  but fundamental to a successful business is making really great products that people want to buy  Great products in this context means that they are not just a little better than what competitors sell or that people already have  but a lot better  This simple fact seems so obvious  but some people get so caught up in trying to  start a company   that they don t pay enough attention to creating the products that define the business  How much better than the offerings of competitors must the product be  There is no formula to determine the correct result  but the answer is  a lot   The SpaceX example is a quite interesting case to examine this question  Launching payloads into space on rockets has traditionally been thought of as a business that does not result in significantly more demand if there is a price drop  This assumption about price elasticity resulted in the traditional space launch providers deciding to milk their sunk non recurring engineering and not invest significant amounts in new price reducing innovation  In short  these traditional launch providers believed that a lower prices would not result in more profit so they kept prices flat to increasing  This price elasticity assumption by the incumbents created an opportunity for Musk to innovate by relaxing another assumption which was that reuse of rocket stages was not possible  Musk reasoned that if Columbus and other explorers of his era had been forced to throw away their ships after every voyage not much would have been accomplished  Musk has proven that part of rockets can be reused and that other price reducing innovations are possible  Musk now must demonstrate that more rocket launches will be purchased due to the lower price so as to increase the total addressable market  TAM  for launch  For example  a price drop from  375M to  100 Million for a heavy rocket launcher would be a significant price cut  How many more heavy launches will be generated at the new lower price  No one really knows yet  We can expect Musk to be innovative in looking for ways to increase launch demand  For example  the huge communications satellite constellation Musk has proposed is arguably an example of him looking for ways to create new payloads for SpaceX   3  It s OK to have your eggs in one basket  as long as you control what happens to that basket   The key word in this quotation is  control   If you take dependencies on others and you have no alternative supplier  i e  what Roger Fisher calls no BATNA  the suppliers can block your success  For example  if you build a rocket and you must source your booster from a single supplier  then that supplier controls your fate  This is why Musk prefers to make everything he needs or have multiple suppliers  He does not want to buy components from traditional suppliers of launch who want the price of launch to remain high  This is a set of problems related to what I have called  wholesale transfer pricing  in other posts on this blog  Michael Porter calls it  supplier bargaining power   Having all your eggs in one basket is a concentrated bet  Warren Buffett has a view on concentrated bets that is similar to Musk  Buffett says    Diversification is a protection against ignorance  It makes very little sense for those who know what they re doing    I can t be involved in 50 or 75 things  That s a Noah s Ark way of investing   you end up with a zoo that way  I like to put meaningful amounts of money in a few things    We believe that a policy of portfolio concentration may well decrease risk if it raises  as it should  both the intensity with which an investor thinks about a business and the comfort level he must feel with its economic characteristics before buying into it  In stating this opinion  we define risk  using dictionary terms  as  the possibility of loss or injury     4    Physics is  a good framework for thinking  Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there   The famous physicist Richard Feynman is a hero to many people  especially to anyone who likes to think about thinking  Feynman was a great believer is being able to understand each step of the reasoning involved in an idea from first principles  David Goodstein once said to Feynman    Dick  explain to me  so that I can understand it  why spin one half particles obey Fermi Dirac statistics   Sizing up his audience perfectly  Feynman said   I ll prepare a freshman lecture on it   But he came back a few days later to say   I couldn t do it  I couldn t reduce it to the freshman level  That means we don t really understand it    Warren Buffet believes the same things about business principles  If you cannot write it down  you have not thought it through  In a previous blog post I compared Feynman to Charlie Munger who also has bottom s up thinking process  What are the factors that really govern the interests involved  rationally considered  What are the influences where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically forming conclusions that may be dysfunctional or incorrect  Munger s style is to first assemble all the relevant facts and then apply a rational process to produce an analysis of those facts and an investing thesis  Even if you can t rely on the same principles as physics in business you can adopt its basic ethos   5   Starting a business is not for everyone  Generally  starting a business  I d say  number one is have a high pain threshold  There s a friend of mine who s got a good saying which is that starting a company is like eating glass and staring into the abyss  That s generally what happens because when you first start a company   there s lots of optimism and things are great  Happiness at first is high  then you encounter all sorts of issues and happiness will steadily decline  and then you will go through a whole world of hurt  and then eventually  if you succeed   and in most cases you will not succeed  Tesla came very close to failure  If you do succeed  after a long time  you will finally get back to happiness      Starting a company is like  staring into the face of death  If that sounds appealing  go ahead    Persistence is very important  You should not give up unless you are forced to give up    You will encounter issues you didn t expect  step on landmines  It s bad  Years 2 to 4 or 5 are usually quite difficult  A friend has a saying  it s  eating glass and staring into the abyss     If you re cofounder or CEO  you have to do all kinds of tasks you might not want to do   If you don t do your chores  the company won t succeed   No task is too menial   Starting a business is as brutally hard as Musk describes  If you like doing things that are brutally hard  and some people do  then you may want to start a business  And if you don t like doing that  then don t  It s that simple  Of course  just liking challenges and hard work is not enough to create success since the founders must have the other required inputs like the necessary skills  significant innovation  a big addressable market and the ability to assemble a great team   6   Constantly seek criticism  A well thought out critique of whatever you re doing is as valuable as gold  and you should seek that from everyone you can  but particularly your friends  Usually  your friends know what s wrong  but they don t want to tell you because they don t want to hurt you  Yeah  they say I want to encourage my friend so I m not going to tell him what I think is wrong with his product  It doesn t mean your friends are right  but very often they are right  and you at least want to listen very carefully to what they say   and to everyone  You re looking for  basically  you should take the approach that you re wrong  That you  the entrepreneur are wrong  Your goal is to be less wrong    Pay attention to negative feedback and solicit it  particularly from friends  Hardly anyone does that  and it s incredibly helpful     It s very important to have a feedback loop  where you re constantly thinking about what you ve done and how you could be doing it better    Some people don t like change but you need to embrace change if the alternative is disaster   To learn from success or failure you need effective feedback loops  Some people take feedback better than other particularly if it is criticism  Musk and people like him are very thick skinned and have a scientific orientation  The best approach is to have  strong ideas weakly held   Someone with strong ideas should know the topics well and have researched all side of the issues  By keeping this strong views weakly held the person can adapt as new information and idea arrive  What people struggle with most is learning from mistakes  Charlie Munger has views that are quite similar to Musk on this topic  Munger says   Why not celebrate stupidities    I like people admitting they were complete stupid horses  asses  I know I ll perform better if I rub my nose in my mistakes  This is a wonderful trick to learn   It is through the process of making mistakes and having success in the real world that you can learn and establish sound business judgment   7   Work like hell  I mean you just have to put in 80  to 100 hour weeks every week   This  improves the odds of success  If other people are putting in 40 hour work weeks and you re putting in 100 hour work weeks  then even if you re doing the same thing  you know that you will achieve in four months what it takes them a year to achieve   The work ethic of Elon Musk is legendary  He has been described at working 15 hours days and sleeping six hours a night  Musk s ex wife talks about his work habits this way   I had friends who complained that their husbands came home at seven or eight  Elon would come home at eleven and work some more  People didn t always get the sacrifice he made in order to be where he was  He does what he wants  and he is relentless about it  It s Elon s world  and the rest of us live in it   This set of quotes about the value of hard work and working harder than your competitors from Musk makes me think of Michael Mauboussin s point that if you can work to change the outcome of something what you do to impact that outcome isn t luck  The cause of that success is instead hard work or skill   8   I don t think it s a good idea to plan to sell a company    My motivation for all my companies has been to be involved in something that I thought would have a significant impact on the world   As I said above  Musk is the poster child for the value of the missionary as opposed to the mercenary founder  Missionaries are more likely to get through the hard tasks  stress and hardships involved in building a business because they have the drive to succeed  Sometimes a great success is only inches from failure before is eventually breaks through to become a great success  It isn t easy to have people say you are wrong or even crazy  People say that in the early days of Space X his goal was to  the Southwest Airlines of Space   which is not the goal of a mercenary  but rather a missionary  Investors who back missionaries instead of a mercenaries are not only doing the right thing for society they will be more successful financially  Missionaries possess the key quality that Taleb describes as follows   the remarkable ability to engage in rational forms of trial and error  with no comparative shame in failing again  starting again  and repeating failure    9   Any product that needs a manual to work is broken   I love this quote since I do not like to read manuals  I am glad manuals exist  but they are not my passion  Some people love to read manuals  I am not one of those people  The way great designers and engineers can reduce of eliminate the need for a manual is a beautiful thing to see  Some people seem naturally suited for this work just as they are for understanding what consumers will like and buy  As an example  one of my favorite things in life is to watch my friend Craig McCaw handling a new device  Craig is dyslexic and is someone who does not enjoy reading a manual  That is part of what gives him special insight into the mind of a consumer  He has the best instincts for what consumers will buy that I have ever seen   10   If things are not failing  you are not innovating enough   It takes you very little time reading this blog you know I am fond of the ideas of Charlie Munger  He said once   There s no way that you can live an adequate life without many mistakes   Munger s partner Warren Buffett agrees   I make plenty of mistakes and I ll make plenty more mistakes  too  That s part of the game  You ve just got to make sure that the right things overcome the wrong   As I explain above failure is an essential part of harvesting optionality  It is how we acquire the information necessary to innovate  A system without failure is a system that will not progress  The economist Allan Meltzer created the following aphorism to capture this idea   Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin  It doesn t work  Alternatives to capitalism concentrate power in few hands  opening the way to tyranny and brutality  not justice    11   The market is like a manic depressive   This is so close to the  Mr  Market  metaphor that it is hard to imagine that Musk has not read the work of Ben Graham  He has at least read about the ideas of Warren Buffett who calls Mr  Market  a drunken psycho   Anyone who thinks the market is always wise is not paying attention  Entrepreneurs and investors like Musk are able to figure out where conventional wisdom is wrong so as to create or purchase under priced optionality  These entrepreneurs are searching for positive optionality in an environment filled with the mistakes of other people  When the market is depressed is often the best time to invest and start a business  Talent is more available in a downturn if you can find the necessary cash or raise it during good times  This is why venture capitalist Eugene Kleiner once said   When they are passing the hors d oeuvres take two   In achieving his many objectives in recent years Musk has had the good luck to be operating in favorable capital markets  If luck shines on you you for any reason  you should not only take a bow  but take full advantage of it while the sun shines   12   I think it matters whether someone has a good heart    I don t believe in process  In fact  when I interview a potential employee and he or she says that  it s all about the process   I see that as a bad sign   The problem is that at a lot of big companies  process becomes a substitute for thinking  You re encouraged to behave like a little gear in a complex machine  Frankly  it allows you to keep people who aren t that smart  who aren t that creative   Once upon a time  I interviewed with Craig McCaw for a job  I don t remember much about our conversation specifically other than it was very pleasant and we talked about any things  My favorite memory of that day was speaking to someone after the interview and being told that Craig thought I had   a good heart   Just thinking about that feedback makes me smile  More than anyone in my life  Craig McCaw taught me about the value of avoiding conventional thought  action and processes  People who worked at McCaw companies thought of ourselves as pirates and Craig encouraged that approach  Like Musk  McCaw hates process and bureaucracy  The former Bell companies were our competitors and we took pride in operating with unorthodox strategies and tactics when facing them and others as competitors  We were encouraged by Craig s example to think for ourselves and be creative  In terms of his approach to business  Craig is more like Elon Musk than anyone I know  Their personalities are quite different it seems  but their  I would rather be a pirate than join the Navy  attitude toward business is very similar   Notes   Convexity first quote above

284,training-dataset/business/1333.txt,business,Summer Book Recommendations from the Smartest People We KnowOur goal with First Round Review has always been to give you rare  unprecedented access to the people shaping the tech industry   specifically  the advice that they ve gained through experience  or used to get where they are today  So when we sat down earlier this year to double down on

288,training-dataset/product/694.txt,product,Crafting Products That Engage by Donna Lichaw36 Flares 36 Flares    Donna Lichaw is a film school graduate turned product specialist  and she has used her experience in film to develop and advocate a  story first  approach that she now writes about  speaks about and teaches to products managers all over the world   At this year s London  mtpcon she spoke about the importance of engaging an audience   a fundamental tenet of film making is that you tell a story   and how this can be applied to product   Whether it s software  a website  apps or services   digital or analogue   I ll call them products for short  they have a lot in common with films  If you want to engage your audience you have to have a story at your foundation  You can do this by accident or with meticulous care and intent by mapping the story out    Mapping stories  Mapping a story for your users and customers is about making  things go boom   says Lichaw  Every story has a narrative arc with a beginning  middle  and an end  There are plot points along the arc  The narrative arc can be plotted on a chart  says Lichaw  and if the x access is time then the y axis is intrigue and tension  Tension is also a tool which can also be used to develop engaging products  she adds   She uses the plot from Back To The Future to explain how a story ideally should work  During the exposition you are introduced to the hero or main character who typically has a big goal he or she wants to achieve  In Back To The Future Marty McFly wants a truck and a girlfriend and to be different from his family  He has Doc who is a friend with a time machine  The inciting incident or problem is when everything changes   in Back To The Future Libyans shoot Doc because he stole their Plutonium so Marty jumps in the time machine to try to right the situation   This leads to rising action  where every scene has to be more interesting than the one that has gone before  until eventually you reach the moment of crisis  the point of no return when the hero is very close to solving the problem  and we all identify with the hero  The crisis is overcome by the climax or resolution  After the climax comes the denouement  and the narrative should be wrapped up as quickly as possible  It s important that the story doesn t end on a high point   It s important for us as humans that we get closure  we need to know what happens next and we need things wrapped up and we feel calm and content that the episode came to an end   says Lichaw   Life is a story  Cognitive psychologists say that the narrative parsing that we use to understand a two hour movie is the same we use to compute meaning when we think about and use products  The central idea here  says Lichaw  is that life is a story and that you are the hero   So how do you create products that embody your customers as heroes and how do you allow them to use the products successfully  You can use the same narrative arc that would be used for story telling  At the outset  says Lichaw  ask yourself   Who is your hero and what is their goal  What is their problem  why can t they meet their goal  What is your product and market category  what problem will customers use your product to solve  What is the competition  This is where tension comes into play  says Lichaw  and it s important to remember that competition always exists  There will always be a reason for people not to use your product  Remember that competition serves value and competitive advantage  What is the takeaway  What do you want people to experience and feel about your product  Finally  there must be the promise that the customer s goal can be met   Take the iPhone for example  Lichaw illustrates this by applying the narrative to a popular product  the iPhone   In 2007 when the iPhone launched you might have been someone who listened to music and made phone calls   she says   The problem was that it sucked to carry two devices  Not a huge earth shattering problem  certainly supernerds wanted an iPod that made phone calls  a two in one device  a smartphone  There s tension here   is it something that you want  There s competition  there are reasons why people are not going to want to adopt this  they might already own an iPod or think it s difficult to use or too expensive  But it does allow you to listen to music and make phone calls    Lichaw says that if you map the iPhone out like a story then it is anticlimactic  it s a just simple solution to a simple problem  She says that if you take it up a level and look at the iPhone not as building a product that people wanted at the time  but as building a product that people would need to communicate in the modern world  then the story arc is more compelling   This is what Apple did when it introduced the iPhone  The problem then is that  smartphones suck   which introduces tension because the iPhone is a smartphone   We overcome this because Apple promises it s the best way to communicate  and it works like magic  It s not a two in one device  it s a three in one device with an  internet communicator    she says  When Apple promised this to the world  they were creating this idea of what communication would look like in the future  and we ended up with a product that people wanted   This story should weave through everything from unboxing the product to the user interface  and every key flow built needs to deliver on its promise in order to achieve long term engagement   If you build something where you need to engage people  storytelling is an essential tool to engineer engagement because  like it or not  we have storytelling brains   she says   Why story   Lichaw posits that there is no such thing as an actual experience  there are just moments in time and time is fleeting  Because of this our brains have evolved to use story to understand what happened in the past  what is happening now  and what is about happen  Story gives time structure  because there is no other way for us to understand it   When we consume stories our brain activates  and we are more likely to see the utility in something  and more likely to see something as usable  Says Lichaw   If your product story is intact and you prioritise features and requirements based on supporting the story  then you get people who will love your brand  It also affects desirability   it s more likely to make us want to do something  more likely to value and remember the experience and choose it again    Her concluding advice   Ask what s the story  Who s the hero  what s their big goal  and how am I going help them use my product to meet their goal  More importantly how are we going to make things go boom  and make the story never ending,"[288 1314 561 987 232 649 154 567 1360 284 537]"
289,training-dataset/business/618.txt,business,What I ve learned from seeing 20k company pitchesWhat I ve learned from seeing 20k company pitches  Check out my side project Rejectionathon  discount code  EYFRIENDS   which helps founders get over their fear of rejection     I just passed my 2 year mark at 500 Startups  The other day  my colleague asked me how many company pitches I ve personally seen  When we were calculating it out  it came out to about 20k   To be fair  this number includes pitch emails like this  incl a response from my former colleague Sean Percival     In fact  the vast majority of pitches I ve seen probably fall under this category and these only take a few seconds to read and archive  so this is how you get to see 20k pitches    That being said  it s been quite a ride to see so many pitches in just 2 years  Here are some learnings and what I immediately think about when I see a pitch   1  Ideas are a dime a dozen AND it s important to stand out   As an entrepreneur  you think your idea is unique  If you re still in the early stages of your entrepreneur education journey  you may even think you need to protect your idea and not share it with anyone  But even if you re in the later stages of being an entrepreneur  you still feel like your idea is unique or at least maybe there s only one or two other companies out there like you  because that s what you read about in TechCrunch   It turns out everyone has the same ideas   This isn t a bad thing but it means that you need to go in with the mindset of figuring out how to stand out  The good news is that if you re making progress on your business  you can show that you re executing  Most entrepreneurs overpitch their ideas but underpitch how they ve been executing   revenue   traction   setting up infrastructure   etc  This can set you apart  because the vast majority of businesses I see at the seed stage are just ideas with no action   2  Speed matters   Not only is it important to show what you ve done but if you ve been executing on a fast time scale  then that s even more impressive  At the seed stage  there are companies who have been around for 5 months and others for 5 years  So you are not only being benchmarked on hitting milestones but also based upon your pace   This is one of my favorite startup presentations of all time by Mike Cassidy on going fast  Demonstrate that you can pull the trigger on things quickly   whether it be getting customers  hiring   firing employees  or product development  And convey this in your pitch   3  If you are in a super competitive space  it s important to address competition upfront  If you are in a super competitive space   areas like cleaning or food delivery  for example   it s going to be harder for you than you can ever imagine  Even if you are making progress quickly  In these areas  investors are not just seeing a handful of companies doing the same thing but hundreds or thousands   To give yourself the best shot at getting noticed  you need to do 2 things   A  Demonstrate immediately   not at the end of your pitch  that you are self aware that there are other businesses like yours  This shows that you have thought about the competitive landscape and despite knowing that it s competitive  you believe there is an opportunity for you to outcompete all other companies   Being in a competitive space isn t a bad thing   Google was like the 8th search engine to enter the scene and they turned out ok  But you need to address the landscape   B  Address where you fit into this landscape  This is about really understanding how you are different from the other players out there   For example  I was talking last week with a company that is a new type of job board  They showed me their problem slide which said something to the effect of  There are so many people who are unemployed and so many employers who cannot find good talent blah blah blah   Online job boards have been around for a couple of decades and even today is an incredibly competitive space  Everyone understands this problem  So  this is not the correct problem to outline in this pitch  The right problem is to tell me why existing job board solutions suck   are ineffective   etc and be super insightful into the nuances of why this is the case  And then after that  present a differentiated solution that doesn t have these same nuanced issues  In some sense  if you are in a crowded space  your job is to say   The problem is that Companies A  B  and C suck  and here s why    If you can do this  this will help you at least get attention on your pitch   3  I treat referrals and cold emails the same  for the most part   In the beginning  I thought referrals from others would be much higher quality than companies emailing in cold  Sometimes this is true  But often it s not  It depends a lot on who is doing the referrals  It would turn out that  famous  investors referring companies don t necessarily refer better companies  And founders don t necessarily refer great companies either   lot of founders are doing favors for their friends by putting in a good word  And on the flip side  there are some people whom you wouldn t have heard of whose referrals I value the most   So  in the end  it s a bit of a wash  and this is why I think you  as an entrepreneur  can now write cold emails effectively to capture the attention of investors   4  How people present themselves in pitch emails tell me if I should NOT take a meeting  I use pitch emails as a good proxy for finding the most on point   sharp founders  Rather  I can t tell immediately who is on point   sharp  but I can tell who is not  Meandering email copy is not a good sign  Bad spelling   lack of punctuation   also not a good sign  Bad grammar is excusable if you are a non native English speaker  but if you are a native English speaker  that s inexcusable  Use a company domain name as opposed to a Gmail   Yahoo   Hotmail   AOL email address  Otherwise  your business doesn t seem serious enough yet   These all seem obvious and not worth addressing  but you d be surprised just how many pitches have basic mechanical issues  If you are not good at paying attention to detail  ask a friend who is good at that to help you proofread  Getting in the door with your best foot forward is so important  because it s easy for your email to get ignored or lost   Use bullet points when possible rather than paragraphs  They are easier to read  Bullet out the key awesome things about your business  Here are some example bullets   Revenue  now at  15k MRR  growing 30  MoM    Monthly churn is   1     LTV to date is  700  CAC via blended paid channels is  250    Pilot customers include Samsung  MSFT  and Oracle  CEO previously founded a marketing tech company and sold it to Marketo  CTO previously worked as a software engineer at Google X  have worked together for 2 years    If you are sending a deck  refer to this  Your email is just to pique interest to get a meeting not to get an investment   There are a ton of other learnings from having done this job for the last 2 years  but these are the things that come to mind when I see pitches   Fundraising is a nebulous process that I aim to make more transparent  To learn more secrets and tips  subscribe to my newsletter,"[289 868 83 561 154 1390 987

291,training-dataset/product/490.txt,product,Tactics for Redesigning and Relaunching Legacy Products52 Flares 52 Flares    In this talk at ProductTank NYC I recounted five tactics I learned while helping relaunch dozens of digital products over the last decade  and then used to successfully relaunch ICv2 com  ICv2 is a popular trade website for the comic  graphic novel  board game and toy industries   The goal for the relaunch was a complete design and code overhaul under three constraints   Time  Neither the designer nor the developer were full time and Adam  as a board member but not employee of ICv2  also wasn t full time  Real Deadline  Advertising sponsorships were sold around a specific date  Emotional Attachment  A lot of visitors were attached to the site  it was part of their daily routine  so the relaunch couldn t be disruptive   Tactic  1  Mind Melding  I knew that if I had to constantly triangulate between a busy CEO and a part time team  that I d never make deadline  So I spent the first two weeks learning as much about the CEO s perspective as possible  To do this I built rapid paper and HTML idea prototypes to see how the CEO would react to design and feature changes  After this process  I was able to work with the development team efficiently  without having to check in with the CEO all the time  because I had gained an intimate understanding of the CEO s perspective   Tactic  2  Unknown Hunting  It s important to prioritize unknowns upfront  Even though the team assumed that implementing Google Custom Search would be easy  we prioritized implementing it upfront because no one had actually used it before  We quickly found out that Google Custom Search was insufficient for our needs  and implemented an alternative solution   Tactic  3  Wrapping Paper Principle  It s easy to say  no  a lot when you re working toward a hard deadline  But people s ideas  even though they re wrapped in poor execution  can hide brilliance  I call this the  wrapping paper principle    if you think hard about where people s ideas are coming from and discard the ugly wrapping paper you can find a useful gift inside the box   Tactic  4  Sleepwalker Management  Sleepwalkers  as you can read about more in this article  are people who ve been visiting a website for so long it becomes habit  I knew that  given ICv2 s 20 year history  there were a lot of sleepwalkers stumbling about  So to make sure the relaunch wasn t disruptive  I adopted a checklist   Evolve  don t reinvent  It s easy to reinvent a product from scratch  but avoid that temptation as it can be disruptive to long time visitors  Maintain look feel  Use similar colors and styling to make people still feel at home Test if you have time  Some people put out beta versions in advance or launch new versions to partial audience segments  Extra redundancy to avoid downtime  Downtime is the worst possible thing to happen for Sleepwalker management  A day or two of downtime can be catastrophic  Hold some things back  There s no need to overwhelm visitors with a million changes on one day  Hold features and changes back until later and gradually introduce them   Tactic  5  No Missing Piece  With relaunches it s easy to focus too much on the bigger picture and lose sight of the small details that are equally important  I liken this to bringing a board game to someone s house but forgetting the dice   Two examples of forgetting missing pieces are not stress testing code  since new code is often not battle tested  and not redirecting old links properly   I d also advise not having a launch party  and instead have a launch   one month party  since the real work for relaunches often comes in the 30 days after launch   Conclusion  Happily  I can confirm that the result of this relaunch was a massive success  Traffic went up 15   the core audience stuck with the site  server costs plummeted  ad sales went up  More importantly  ICv2 now has a sturdy foundation for the future  If you ve inherited a legacy product  make sure you truly understand it  work out what you don t know as quickly as possible  and start gradually moving towards a foundation you can use to build something brilliant,"[291 1279 154 561 1316 609 51 905 125 327 610]"
295,training-dataset/business/913.txt,business,How I Overcame One of My Deepest Fears as an EntrepreneurI just crushed one of my worst fears  Here s how you can too    I guess this is it   I thought  as I wiped my sweaty palms on my jeans for what seemed like the hundredth time   Any minute now  he s going to skype in  and there won t be any turning back   But for now  escape scenarios continued to play through my mind   What if I lie and say I got sick   Or that my computer crashed   Or that my power went out   For three years now  I d been avoiding this moment   Making up excuses just like the ones above   Gently turning him down with excuses of inconvenience   now s not a great time  we have our heads down on a big launch    Time and time again I ducked him  assuring him that one day soon  I ll be able to make this thing work   But every time  the voice in the back of my head whispered in terror   no  fucking  way    Running through the last few years of dodging my fear wasn t helping  And it made it all the more startling when I finally saw the skype call coming in on my computer   With one last deep  anxious breath  I clicked Accept    Alex  Finally  welcome    Still nervous  I coyly responded with  thanks for having me  man  It s been a journey here trying to get on this show    For the next hour  Mixergy s Andrew Warner and I talked about the history of Groove  why I started the company  and how we went from nothing to nearly 5 million dollars in annual revenue   In that entire history of Groove  this was the first recorded interview I d ever done   And in doing so  I finally walked through the fire of one of my worst  most debilitating fears   Everyone Fears Something  I ve always considered myself a confident person   I m very comfortable on the phone and in person  selling one on one to customers  investors or potential team members  In fact  I love doing those things   But for as long as I can remember  I ve dreaded the idea of  public speaking    Of getting on stage and talking to a crowd  or even of getting in front of a single interviewer and being put on the spot  for hundreds or thousands  or in Mixergy s case  many many thousands  of people to later see and judge   It s not exactly a rational fear for a  confident  person to have   Still  I ve declined every single speaking gig I ve ever been offered   I ve turned down countless podcast interviews  panel invitations and media requests   And for years  I d been dodging Andrew s emails to be featured on Mixergy   And when I finally agreed to do the interview  I continued to plot my escape   Even after doing a pre interview with Andrew s producer the day before our scheduled call  I considered pulling out   The fear threatened to not only hold me back  but it threatened to harm my relationship with someone I deeply respect   It is  of course  an irrational fear   After all  what s the worst thing that could realistically happen   But in the privileged modern world we leave in  almost all of our fears are irrational   And yet we all have them   For me  that fear has been public speaking  For many others in business  it s selling  hiring  firing  server outages  getting on a plane  or one of hundreds of other common fears   I m willing to bet that you  too  are being held back by something you fear   It sucks  It really sucks   But as I ve learned in overcoming a lot of my other fears as a founder  the only certain cure for fear that has worked every single time I ve tried it is to walk through the fire   Walk Through the Fire  I finally did the Mixergy interview   And five minutes in  the realization hit me  this isn t so bad   I had literally spent years terrified of this very moment  thinking through all of the different ways it could go horribly  irreversibly wrong   And yet  in just five minutes of bracing myself and walking through the fire  that panic dissolved   When Andrew sent me the interview recording  I immediately watched it from start to finish   That was excruciating  Watching yourself speak is a deeply embarrassing experience   Still  as I watched myself  clearly nervous and stumbling often  but ultimately delivering answers that I was proud of and that could help Andrew s audience grow their businesses from our journey  I was proud   I started to get emails from friends  and from people I ve never met before  about the interview   The video  audio and transcript of the interview can be found here  or you can watch it below   I know that I still have a lot to improve on   But I m thrilled that I did it  and I m excited to have sufficiently overcome my fear of speaking that I m eager to do it again and get better   My Goal for 2017  and How You Can Crush Your Fear This Year Too  Crushing my fear by walking through the fire was liberating  It made me realize  not just on a rational level  but on a very deep emotional one  that there s nothing to fear   And internalizing that mindset opens me up to a world of possibilities   Doing more interviews like this can help make our product and our company more human  as Andrew told me   It s funny that you have a fear of speaking  And really  it s cool  because it makes you more human  People think of you as superman on the blog  and it s nice to see you re human like the rest of us    Showing off more of that human side can only help us   And now that the fear is gone  I can focus on getting better at speaking  something that I have no doubt can help me  and my company  grow   Andrew even gave me some generous feedback and advice at the end of our interview for continuing to improve   I think you ve got a great story  I think it would suck for me if you did it  but I think you should do more interviews  I think the reason you should do more interviews is to put more of a personality on the story  Every time you show more personality  people care more about Groove and it humanizes you in a way that a product like yours needs to be humanized     Go do some smaller ones  do a bunch of smaller ones  actually  that you think are not going to help you with traffic  because they re going to be so nervous that you re going to feel comfortable in comparison     They re going to give you so much room to screw up  and because no one is going to see it  it won t matter     Then you build up your confidence and your experience  You ve done them a favor     Some of them end up being really big anyway and then they feel like they owe you and you ve gotten a lot out of that     Then you start to rock and roll and know how to tell your story well  Andrew Warner  And later  when I followed up via email  he gave me even more terrific advice   So one of my key goals for 2017 is to do what Andrew said  get as much practice in interviewing and speaking as I reasonably can  to make myself a better speaker  and to be the kind of founder that makes my team and my customers proud when I take the stage   It s easy to avoid something just because you re scared of it  I did that for a long time  But it won t help you   It won t help you improve  and it won t help you succeed   That s why I d love to see you take on this important goal for 2017  pick one of the fears that s been holding you back  whether in business or in life  and destroy it   Set a commitment that you ll feel bad backing out of   Walk right up to

306,training-dataset/business/837.txt,business,How to build the next Trello and sell it for  425 million or moreHow to build the next Trello and sell it for  425 million or more Atlassian bought Trello for  425 million  Because Trello was on trajectory to kill Atlassian   So  how do you build the next Trello and get rich  By not building a Trello clone  Why  Trello is a classic example of a disruptive innovation  If you deal with disruptive innovation  the first mover takes everything  Atlassian bought Trello for  425 million not because of its brand or its user base  but because Trello was a big threat to the company s future  That s why Google and other companies make similar acquisitions  If you want to build a  400 million startup  build something simple  This essay explains why   The rationale behind Trello s acquisition   Fog Creek launched Trello in 2011  and six years later sold it for  425 million  It was Atlassian s biggest acquisition ever  But why did Atlassian pay so much money for Trello  Because Trello disrupted the project tracking space  Products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper  simpler  smaller  and more convenient to use   Trello brings a different value proposition to the market  Its value proposition is collaboration and simplicity  Jira s value proposition is different  It seems that Atlassian is a well managed company  Its managers did everything according to the books  They listened to their customers  and created a better and more complicated product  By adding new features  they sought to capture new customers  They went upmarket   While the company s revenue grew  its product became overly complicated and difficult to maintain  By moving upmarket  Atlassian created a vacuum at lower price points into which competitors with disruptive technologies could enter  This is what Trello did   Trello created a cheaper  simpler  and smaller version of Jira  It marketed its product to segments of customers  such as marketers  designers  and managers  which weren t a focus for Atlassian  In 2011  there was no competition for Trello and it filled the vacuum created by Atlassian  Because Atlassian overshot the market   In their efforts to stay ahead by developing competitively superior products  many companies don t realize the speed at which they are moving up market  They fail to recognize that they re over satisfying the needs of their original customers as they race the competition towards higher performance  higher margin markets  And they fail to see that in doing so  they re creating a vacuum at lower price points into which competitors employing disruptive technologies can enter   See Clayton Christensen s writings in The Innovator s Dilemma    Trello Board Example  Source  Zapier com  Jira Board Example  Source  Spartez com  At the same time  Jira became expensive  But its mainstream customers would accept fewer features for better pricing  That s how Atlassian became vulnerable to attack from competitors with cheaper  simpler  and more convenient products   By adding more features  Trello will also move upmarket and cross the mainstream market needs  the blue line   When it crosses the blue line  Jira s mainstream customers will switch to Trello  This is how disruptive innovation overtakes established products  It happened to other industries  such as disk drives and mainframe computers  It will happen in the project tracking industry too   That s why Trello became the biggest threat to Atlassian s future  Trello became an attacker  Its product had less features  It was simple  And it was fucking cheap  It was disruptive   I m not working for Atlassian  I have no connections to its employees  But I know how it feels when disruptive innovation meets a 15 year old company  It sucks in all areas   The CEO of Atlassian did it right  Instead of trying to fight the disruptive technology  he accepted it and bought Trello  In an interview  he said   All companies fit into one of two buckets  either becoming a software company or being disrupted by one  Every industry is being fundamentally altered by software   I m sure many of Atlassian s employees don t understand this decision  Because it makes no sense for them  In their minds  Trello is a shitty product compared to Jira  But Atlassian s CEO secured their jobs and salaries by buying Trello  Because Trello was on trajectory to kill Atlassian   The market reaction was positive  Atlassian s share price went from  25 03 on January 9th  the date of the announcement  to  28 03 January 23rd   Atlassian failed to build its own Trello   According to Clayton Christensen  leadership in disruptive technology has been very important  Companies that entered the market first were six times more likely to succeed than those that entered later  Therefore  if Atlassian would even create its own version of Trello  there s no evidence to suggest that product would succeed  Atlassian wasn t a first mover   But there is a bigger reason than the missed first mover advantage  Atlassian is a public company  The company needs to grow its business by 30  per year  Therefore  everyone in the company needs to make money  Lots of money  And to make lots of money  you need big customers   In 2016  Atlassian generated  458 million in revenue  To grow 30  in 2017  it needed to generate an additional  137 million  In its shareholder letter  it forecast a total revenue in the range of  597 to  603 million   According to Forbes com  Trello generates around  10 million in annual recurring revenue  A clone of Trello is not going to help Atlassian reach its goal  Atlassian has many good managers  it seems  Good managers would never allocate resources to build another Trello  because doing so would not solve the company s main problem  the question of how to grow revenue  Instead  they will do everything necessary to satisfy their biggest customers  needs   Over time  they have created a set of values  They don t care about a potential  10 million in revenue  They need an additional  137 million  Therefore  everyone at Atlassian has a focus on big customers and their needs  And big customers want a bigger  better  more complicated product   As we ve learned  products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper  simpler  smaller  and more convenient  That s the opposite of what Atlassian does  Atlassian s set of values has no room for Trello s disruptive innovation   So what happens after the acquisition of Trello   I remember when Google bought Android  Android s operations were not fully integrated into Google s main business  Even Google s employees had no access to the Android offices  As we can see  it was one of the Google s best acquisitions  But why didn t Google integrate Android into its main business  Simple  Because Google s processes  values  and culture would have killed Android  That s one of the main reasons for not integrating newly acquired companies   Atlassian is a 15 year old company  It has established processes  values  and culture  It works with different customer segments than Trello  Atlassian has 1 700 employees  Its executives now need to make a decision  Should the company integrate Trello or not   If Atlassian s executives are smart  they will not integrate Trello into their main business  And for Trello employees  If you hear that integration is on the way  start looking for a new job  If integration happens  it s the beginning of the end  Because Trello is not a part of Atlassian s values  If something is not a part of a company s values  there is no priority for it   The values of an organization are the criteria by which decisions about priorities are made  and the prioritization of decisions affects employees at every level  The values of successful firms tend to evovle in a predictable fashion in at least two dimensions  The first relates to acceptable gross margins  The second dimension along which values predictably change relates to how big a business must be in order to remain interesting   Again  please see Clayton Christensen s work in The Innovator s Dilemma    Trello has created a new emerging market  There are no  800 million emerging markets  When emerging markets are small  they are least attractive to large companies  Therefore  Trello will become underserved in money and resources inside Atlassian   Trello will become the new Jira   In a blog post  the CEO of Atlassian wrote   Trello will become an important part of the Atlassian portfolio   I guess it s too early to tell the truth  It will be the other way around   In a few years  Trello will cross the blue line  Everything that mainstream customers want will be available in Trello  It s the tipping point for customers of Jira  They will start to migrate to Trello   By crossing the blue line  Trello will enter the mainstream market  Trello will start to drive huge profits for Atlassian  The revenue generated by Trello will be higher than the revenue generated by Jira  This is the simple reason why Trello will become the new Jira   Of course  many of you think I m crazy  But this is how disruptive innovation works  The weaknesses of Trello today will become strengths tomorrow   These are the next  400 million startups   Zapier published statistics about the fastest growing apps  In first place was Airtable  with a growth rate of 682   I hadn t heard of Airtable  and I was curious to know what it does  I checked out its website and learned that it s basically a cheaper and simpler version of Microsoft Access  As we established earlier  products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper  simpler  smaller  and more convenient to use   What about Quip  the cloud based word processing app  It was founded in 2012 and sold to Salesforce for  750 million  Quip is similar to Trello  Both are simple in terms of functionality  Quip is a disruptive innovation to Google Docs and Google Sheets  Just like how Google disrupted Microsoft Office not that many years ago   While some companies move upmarket and create complex products  others use the vacuum for innovation as an entry point  Through observation  you can find a vacuum in many industries  By filling the vacuum with simpler and cheaper technology  you can build a  400 million startup   There are some interesting industries waiting for disruptive innovation  One is the almost  4 billion marketing automation industry  Many years ago  the leaders in the marketing automation software field overshot the market  The same happened to the accounting software market   Scott Cook  Intuit s founder  decided that the makers of accounting software for small businesses had overshot the functionality required by that market  thus creating an opportunity for a disruptive software technology that provided adequate but not superior functionality  and which was simple and convenient to use   Quickbooks proceeded to capture 70  of the market within two years of its introduction  Christensen    Create something new  but simpler and cheaper  Make something the mainstream market doesn t want now  but will want later  The weaknesses of today will become the strengths of tomorrow   If you want to get ideas for your  400 million startup  subscribe to my newsletter at http   tarasowski co  PS  You re reading this essay on Medium

323,training-dataset/product/661.txt,product,Product Management in a Driverless WorldA few days ago  while I was walking to work  an enthusiastic pedestrian jostled me out of my commuter daze  he pointed out an inconspicuous Uber doing a driverless test in downtown San Francisco  It felt like a moment  like the first time I used an iPhone  And it was there I thought   how will we product manage a driverless world  What are the necessary PM skills  What behaviors can we expect to change with this new culture and technology   While product managers and engineers at Google  Uber  Cruise and other leading automotive companies are inventing our future  it won t just be the car experts impacting our driverless world  Today s leading experts in e commerce  venture capital  and enterprise software will also participate in creating this new ecosystem of transportation and new business models   So how exactly will PMs build and manage technology in the driverless future  In order to prepare for tomorrow s reality  I wanted to sit down with a panel of product leaders to hear their expectations and predictions on what the job will look like in the next three to five years from now   Meet The Panel   Brandon Chu  Senior Product Manager at Shopify  Kevin Lee  Venture Capital Associate at FundersClub and Founder of Product Manager HQ  Neil McCarthy  Product Lead at Yammer  Now fasten your seat belts  Here s how to PM the driverless world   What hard and soft skills do PMs need to have in the driverless world   Kevin  PMs will have to spend a lot of time thinking about consumer trust  It ll be tough for consumers to make this mental shift in the beginning because we re asking people to cross a chasm and relinquish full control  People hate that     You ll notice the Google s self driving car looks   well  really cute  It has two eyes  similar to a Volkswagen Beetle   Google did that because it feels friendly and helps to build trust  Additionally  even though they don t need to  their self driving car has a tablet in the vehicle that actually displays when it senses obstacles such as a pedestrian crossing  Their computer vision and algorithms are way smarter and more perceptive than a human s motor skills  But the tablet display helps build up a sense of trust so that a passenger can visually be reassured that the car knows what s going on externally and this in turn helps a passenger build a trusting relationship with the car   Neil  One major skill PMs will need in the driverless future is to understand the real world and how it s going to impact the product  For example  the people who design the physical interior of a self driving car have to consider that the experience may be terrifying  or exhilarating  for passengers  So with that  there can t be too many changes to the physical  product  since the experience is taking such a leap   PMs will have to configure solutions for passengers when they have to problem solve on the fly  like when the car gets stuck or breaks down  Questions can get as granular as how do we communicate something that s digital  like a map s ETA  in the physical world   There will be an overlap in the skills PMs use at a pure internet tech company  However  depending on your focus at a driverless company  prerequisites will start to reflect those that build elevators or construction equipment  It s a blend of civil and software engineering   Brandon  We ll have to stop thinking about the car as just a product and think of it more as a platform  When driverless becomes the norm  a car is basically a moving box that s connected to the internet where people spend time between physical locations   Apps  on this platform in this context could still be software  but they could also be physical features like having a training bike in the car for in transit workouts   For PMs  you ll either manage the platform by creating the right extensibility and nurturing the developer ecosystem  or you ll be a PM focused on building one of those apps  On either side  PMs will need to bridge their skills across industrial and software design  and enter other domains like regulatory  insurance  and AI in order to be effective   It is truly a platform where everything  even down to the drive train  or the energy system it uses   electric  gas  or whatnot   to the actual logic of how it handles being driverless becomes a platform     Kevin  That s a great way to put it  If there s an open OS  and Google willingly opens it to the public like Android  then any car manufacturer or developer can develop on the self driving OS   What are some other key points to product management in the driverless world   Neil  I think it s an accurate assumption to say that most of the product managers of today have never worked on a product where  failure  of the product meant someone might be killed  In that  there s a major shift in expectations and the stakes are so much higher than working at any other pure internet company   Kevin  Definitely  Upholding safety is the number one concern for all PMs  There have been many concerns voiced about what happens when a self driving car is forced into a situation between sacrificing the life of its passengers or a pedestrian on the sidewalk  It s somewhat of a philosophical debate   do you take a utilitarian approach to save as many lives as possible or does the OS always prioritize the passenger  I imagine over time  regulation will standardize safety the more and more we collect data to learn from it   Brandon  The influence of safety as a critical car feature will grow in the future  Companies will start comparing algorithms competitively as a major selling point    X autonomous cars are  1  safer than Y autonomous vehicles   for example   Where it gets dark is how cars handle the owner s safety relative to the safety of others  Is there a car company that makes a selling point that  in all cases it will protect your life above all else   Even at the cost of many other lives  What is the regulatory environment that needs to form around that  I can see the government having to control and approve driverless car AI   Neil  Ensuring safety will be the number one priority  We also have to consider that there will be an entire generation just getting use to the idea of losing control of driving   What Google is doing with self driving cars now is the right way  They have a super long beta program that trains an algorithm to have encountered so many different scenarios that by the time Google deploys and scales  the driverless algorithm is safety tested   Once safety is ensured  what major changes in the car experience do you predict   Neil  The PMs of the future will need interior design skills  Right now  Uber and Lyft are two companies that are the closest thing we have to self driving cars  You don t have to drive them  You get to the place that you were going to you  However  in the future  the layout of the car will reflect a passenger s requested experience   For example  if you re hosting a conference call during your commute with co workers  you might request one that s more spacious with screens  a coffee maker and teleconferencing systems  etc  If you re going for a longer drive  it might resemble a comfortable WeWork space or Airbnb   The long term future vision is to turn the car into shared space with the other people  Understanding the purpose of a passenger s travel will be crucial for driverless car companies  like Uber  to give you the right experience   Brandon  All the industrial design we ve been optimizing for since the existence of cars  around aerodynamics  engine size  etcetera  is sort of out the window  For example  now  you actually want to reduce engine size  that way  you make the interior room as big and comfortable as possible   If people don t own cars as much  maybe they don t care at a vanity level what the exterior of the car looks like  It s all about the inside experience  There will probably be a whole wave of just interior decoration and furniture  There s condo furniture  and now there s car furniture   Kevin  The funny thing about self driving cars is that ironically you re not designing for the driver  you re designing for the passenger only  There s no such thing as a driver anymore  This fundamentally alters how PMs should think about re designing existing standard car components like the steering wheel or gas and brake pedals   What cultural norms will shift with driverless cars   Neil  Autonomous vehicles will increase the car sharing and car pooling culture even further   Kevin Lee  We can be fairly certain that private companies like the Ubers of the world or city governments will run entire fleets of autonomous vehicles available on demand which may severely impact individual car ownership  Cars have always been a depreciating asset that aren t used for the majority of the day so it technically makes more sense to  rent  or  call a car  on a just in time basis  If you still decide to own your own self driving car  cultural norms around the idea of manually parking  cleaning your car  or re fueling may completely shift  You can imagine scenarios where you get to your destination  walk out  and your car automatically drives away to go find parking for itself or go get itself cleaned and re fueled to maximize time efficiency     Brandon Chu  Favoring renting autonomous cars vs  buying them seems to be inevitable  not just for economic reasons but for utility as well  Renting enables more optionality for the rider  and people might want to rent specific types of cars depending on their current needs or life stages     For example  what if you re in a period of your life when you have really young kids and need a specific configuration with car seats  extra airbags etc  Do you really want to buy a car of a specific configuration just for that short time frame of your kid s life  That s why I look to the platform model where a company can build  let s say  cars that are specific for infants  Then  you rent those cars during that stage of your life   Other norms that will shift are the way we use space today  As an empty box you spend time in  it s not hard to imagine people having meetings in cars  dining in them  or working out in them   Neil  In the future  if lots of people own self driving cars  they may become passive forms of income  Just like you can rent your car out through services like GoGet  driverless car owners could schedule their cars to do the same  That way  your car doesn t just sit in a garage  An owner could schedule its driverless car to do pick ups and drop offs while you sit at home  This way  the owners of the car make money  It s like owning a rental property or putting a spare room on Airbnb   As product managers  how do you think driverless companies will measure success of their service or platform   Neil  Companies will measure success off of safety  car or fleet utilization  and revenue accrued  Especially if households are  farming  out their cars to earn passive income  utilization and revenue earned will be key in determining the cost benefit of purchasing a driverless car vs  just calling one through Uber when you need it     Brandon  As driverless becomes the norm  the profit from selling a vanilla A to B ride will head towards zero as competition rises  so most driverless car companies will begin to measure their success in terms of platform utilization  Rides themselves will be table stakes  but how many additional services or premium features a passenger uses during the ride will be a core metric of platform health  These platforms will need to position themselves somewhere on the spectrum of premium vs  bare bones services  Are we the iOS or the Android of driverless cars  Are we an ad free platform and how much are consumers willing to pay for that  How personalized does our platform enable a passenger ride experience to get   Kevin  Neil s covered the fundamental success drivers   assuming that safety has been perfected and standardized  If we re talking success from a financial perspective per car ride  two ways to increase margins or your Lifetime Value  LTV  per user is if you decrease the costs  which ultimately has a floor  or you figure out how to offer more value added services per car ride  I imagine you could bundle services together like calling for a self driving car that also comes with a coffee it picked up from Philz Coffee  Or  you could request a self driving car that comes pre installed with a video conferencing system so you can get a meeting done in the ride   Neil  I also believe we have to measure user anxiety and how it changes  In the first six months of product managing a driverless car company  I would conduct user research to validate the hypothesis that people would probably be scared the first time they ride in a self driving car   Then  I would create some hypothesis about what we can do to calm that fear  What information can we present in the car that makes it seem safe  How can we change the experience to give people a sense of comfort in their new type of transportation   I think back on how Prius launched their electric cars and showed the internal mechanism of the engine as a marketing strategy  Seeing how the sausage is made can be a psychological strategy to quell the fear or distrust in the unknown     In the first generation of autonomous vehicles  product managers will probably have to build a stream of features that can give a user control over the car  That way  PMs can manage user anxiety  and train the passengers of the future   Photos were made available through Jaguar

experience  and he s eager to share them  In his time outside of Basecamp s support inbox  Chase is the host of the Support Ops podcast  There  in a regular roundtable discussion alongside colleagues from Automattic  Buffer and Wistia  he explores how to create happier and more successful users  Chase recently joined me on our own Inside Intercom podcast to share how to improve experiences for customers  as well as your own support team  Our chat covers making remote teammates successful  removing contact barriers for customers  the internal and external benefits of investing in help content  and much more  If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the interview  but if you re short on time  here are five key takeaways  In the world of support  there s always another email in the queue or a chat awaiting response  To keep your support team from burning out  you need to establish a culture of limits   that it s okay to turn off the computer at working day s end  It s true that a happy workforce makes for happy customers  but you can t establish the former without giving your team opportunities to learn and grow both soft and hard skills  and share knowledge  Startups must pay attention to the small things that make it harder for customers to get in touch  Things like no reply email addresses may seem harmless  but create a very real barrier  Invest in self serve help content for your product from day one  and that means treating your help site just as you would a product feature   it should look  sound and feel like your support conversations  Providing support for older versions of your product can be a big customer happiness win  but you must be prepared to invest time getting new hires up to speed on the quirks of previous builds  Adam Risman  Chase  welcome to the show  Obviously Basecamp needs no formal introduction  We ve had Jason Fried on the show and are big admirers of your product and work  Can you give us some insight into how support at Basecamp has evolved in your time there  Chase Clemons  I was hired in May 2011  I got out of college and I thought for a while I wanted to be a public school teacher and realized that really wasn t my jam  I stuck around the restaurant world for a while  just because growing up my parents had restaurants  so I was really familiar with it  Basecamp put out an open job for a support team member  and I applied thinking there s no way in hell I m going to get this  A week later I got a call from Jason and everything just happened really quickly  We were a really small team at that point  maybe half a dozen people  and our customer base was not quite as big as it is today  The support volume wasn t quite as big as it was today  Now we re one of the largest teams inside Basecamp itself  We re up to 12 13 people  and with those extra people we get to do cool things like trying out live chat for customers or trying out some social media ideas or some community things  a little marketing  all those other things that you can really experiment with once your team gets big enough to give you some space  Adam  That s interesting to hear about your background prior to coming into a customer support role  How diverse are the backgrounds on your team  Chase  That s one of the things we look at  For the most part the people that apply for jobs on the support team are pretty diverse  We ve hired several former librarians  We have a former apartment complex manager  I was from the restaurant world  People that all were interacting with customers in some way  shape  or fashion  but they weren t doing what we think of as online customer support   Adam  Are there certain skills that all those people share  Chase  It sounds clich d  but there s the thing that everybody calls soft skills  like empathy  being able to write well  being able to communicate well  Those are the common threads between all of us  In those jobs you re dealing with customers face to face so you have to be quick on your feet about thinking through the situation  how you can help that particular customer  It s all things that translate really  really well to online customer support  The hard skills  those are things that we just teach  Here s how Basecamp works  Here s how our email system works  Here s how Intercom works  etc  Creating a remote culture Adam  Basecamp is truly a remote workforce  and your founders wrote the book on remote working  A lot of growing companies the first thing to go remote is support  Perhaps it s to cover more time zones  to be where your customers are  or even reach 24 7 coverage  What s been the key to creating a healthy culture among team members that are so spread out  Chase  The biggest thing for me personally has been limits  I joke around with the rest of my family and say   I can do my job from the middle of a field as long as I have a laptop and I have an internet connection somehow   You don t get a snow day  You can always work whenever you want to work  so one of the first things that we always instill in new hires is knowing your limits  Knowing when to turn off the computer  when to shut down the browser  when to walk away from it  With customer support  there s always another email in the queue  there s always another chat that can be entered  There s always another tweet that needs an answer  so it can be tough to know when to stop working now and just walk away  That s one thing that I think is really key  especially when it comes to being a healthy contributing member on a remote team like ours  Know those limits  because if you don t then it s going to be a world of pain  Know those limits  because if you don t then it s going to be a world of pain  Adam  Do you have to go the extra mile when it comes to sharing information that everyone has learned when they re spread apart like that  and not retreat into silos with the things you re learning in customer conversations every day  Chase  Absolutely  I mentioned earlier  we look for people that are good writers  The reason for that is because you have to be able to communicate in a written form whether it s talking to a customer or it s pitching a new idea to the rest of the team or giving an update on a project  All that happens for the most part via written text  Granted  you can do video tours of a new feature that you re working on or a new idea  You can sprinkle in all sorts of images and pictures and things like that  but for the most part your ability to write well directly relates to how effective you are at being able to interact with the rest of your team  You re also doing a lot of this not only for the moment in time  but also for people down the road that are going to come back and read this later  When we re writing out the explanation for why a design is a certain way  or why the choices we made to do live chat rather than this  we want to be able to effectively communicate them  That way our new hire six months down the road can read it and instantly be up to speed on that conversation  The keys to a happy support team Adam  So much of what we read every day about good support focuses on obvious things like keeping customers happy and avoiding churn  but at the foundation of all that you ultimately need a happy workforce  How do you facilitate career growth for your support team so they don t feel like they have to leave support for a product or a customer success role for advancement  Are there things beyond people management that you can offer in the support  Chase  There s two things tied up in this  The first one being are you happy with where your career is going  Are you happy with where you are right now and the options you have for your career  The second part is what are those options  What things can you do in support  Basecamp is a relatively flat organization  so take our support team  for instance  we have a team lead  and then everybody else is pretty much on the same level  There s no  If you do three more projects and collect two more stars you get to bump up   We just don t really have that  Instead what we do is we focus on growing you as a support pro  Advancing you and your skills whether it s those soft skills that we talked about  or hard skills like learning CSS so you can help figure out bugs a little bit easier  Whatever those things are that you want to do  we help and make sure that you have those opportunities to do that  Make sure the circumstances and the situation are primed for happiness  A good example  Basecamp does an internship program  so Marissa  one of my support teammates  and I were talking about what it would look like if we were mentors and we had somebody as an intern  That s going to be a fun side project that we get to work on  It s not climbing a ladder  but it s going to advance us as support pros  We are going to get better at our job from doing something like that  The other thing really is that happiness I mentioned  A lot of people are wrapped up in having to have a super happy workforce because happy people mean happy customers  and that s true  At the same time the job that we have is to make sure the circumstances and the situation are primed for happiness  I can t make somebody happy  Especially for startups as they focus on   Well I ve got to have a happy workforce   Yeah  you do  but you ve got to create that circumstances  the context  the situation for it  rather than worrying about is Joe going to be happy if I tell him to do X  Y  and Z  Adam  When it comes to your teammates communicating that level of happiness is there anything you can do for remote team members to open up those lines of communication  Chase  Definitely  We go as far as to we have a project set up called Care Camp  where you can go in and you can talk about things like if you re feeling stressed at work and what are some options for setting yourself up in a situation where you could be less stressed  It s also a place where we talk about different food diets and exercising because all that plays a part in a person being happy in the bigger sense  We do that  We also do one on ones  not only with Kristin  our team lead  but also with each other  A lot of it  too  is after working with somebody for a long time you can tell if something is going on just from the way they re interacting with you  The example I like to use is I ve worked with Joan and Marissa now for five years  If one of them is having a bad day I can feel that through their text chat conversation with me  and vice versa  That s something that s only going to come with time  so if you re a brand new startup and you re doing this remote thing  don t think it s just going to automatically happen  You ll start to pick up on certain people s habits and little ticks and things like that  and you ll get a good sense of where they are that day  Adam  Speaking again about structure within teams  what s your take on specialization  Is it a good way for team members to carve out a niche and gain deeper learning or does it open up more windows for silos  Chase  Specialization for specialization s sake  I m not a fan of it  I m okay with the idea of you want to get better at a certain part of the product or you want to really dig in on how PCI compliance works so you can really have a good understanding of how billing works  That s fine  If you want to dive deep on that  go for it  The end goal should not be for you to hoard that knowledge  The end goal should be for you to share all of that so that all of us get a knowledge boost from what you learned  Specialization  if you want to do it  go for it  but just remember to share whatever you learn with the class  Make sure that you write it down so future hires will have that to refer back to  Don t keep it locked up to the point where if any billing email comes in  you have to go   Jane over there  she s the only one that can handle this  so we are just going to have to wait for her to get back from vacation   Share  Specialize but share  Letting customers get in touch Adam  Earlier this year you wrote a really great post on Signal vs Noise about the issue of no reply email addresses  Basically they create an unnecessary and impersonal blocker for customers who might want to have a conversation with you  A lot of startups are still using these for things like newsletters  Many of our listeners are coming from early stage startups themselves  so I m sure this isn t your only pet peeve in the space  What other common blockers might they be creating by simply following these trends that seem innocent on the surface  Be particular about how the system automatically treats your customers  Chase  Yeah  It seems so innocent  It s like an email address that you just happen to throw in that one little form field on your newsletter  On the receiving end it s so impersonal  As far as other little things  and there might not be another customer in the world that actually agrees with me on this stuff  but I think like little things like making sure it s really  really easy to get over to your support documentation  There s some bigger ones too  When you first set up whatever app you re using to do your customer support in whether  it s Intercom or Help Scout  be really particular about how the system automatically treats your customers  I m sure you ve been in the situation where you email some company and then you get an automatic email reply back that assigns you a ticket number  and then tells you all these weird little short codes that you can use if you want to open the ticket or close the ticket  That ticket language drives me nuts  It s an email  That s all it should be  Actually the worst offender is if I get a reply back from a company and I don t reply to it  then 24 or 48 hours later I get this automatic email from this system saying   Hey  you haven t replied  We are going to close this ticket out  Go ahead and open up a new one if your question is not answered yet   I m sitting there thinking this is such a robotic move  It s like I m trapped in a system now  and it s usually really unintentional  Whatever support product they picked  it might have that as the default and then you have to go in and turn it off  Pay attention to those little things  Pay attention to the things that make it a little bit harder on your customer when you could be making it a little bit easier on them  Adam  Right  When I m in that experience  as I m trying to make progress I m actually being presented something that makes me feel as though I m further away from it  Chase  Exactly  I was talking to an airline the other day  and it was literally like   Oh  do you have your ticket number   I m sitting there going   What  You have my name and my email address  That should be more than enough for you to figure out what s going on  What ticket number   The importance of a good help site Adam  No matter how many blockers you remove  sometimes the quickest route to an answer for users is through self serve  At Basecamp you have a really robust and intuitive help doc site  and it s clear that you ve invested in that space  When should startups be investing in this kind of content  and what s been the key to doing it well for you guys  Chase  Startups are going to get a million different answers about when you should start doing this  For me  it s always from day one  As soon as you release your product and have customers using it  you need to have a help doc site that is basically a feature of your product  Don t treat it like an afterthought  don t treat it like this nice to have little thing over here  Treat it with the same care and intensity as an actual feature inside of your product itself  Invest in it from the very beginning  and then from there any time you add a new feature just go ahead and add that into your help site  Do those simultaneously   One of the things that we push for here at Basecamp is the moment a new feature goes out to the customers we flip the switch on the documentation for that on the help site  It s instantly live the moment customers get that new feature  Not an afterthought  It s going to take a little bit of coordinating  That s fine  If you have to take an extra day or two for the help site to be updated to release that new feature  that s fine  Take two extra days  Just make sure that it s a feature of your product  I think that a lot of people forget that  At the end of the day a help site does two basic core things  First it explains how to use something in the product  and then second it explains why you should use it  A good example with us  if you ever use Basecamp 3  we have two tools inside of it  One is called Campfire  One is called the Message Board  Campfire is this group chat tool  instant conversation back and forth  Messages are more like a traditional message board  You post a message about an update or an announcement  and then people are able to reply to it as a common thread underneath it  With our help site we talk about not only how you use those  like how do you post a message  we cover how do you format the text in the message  how do you format the text in a message  how do you save it as a draft before you post the message  Then we also talk about why  like what s the situation where you want to use an instant chat  versus a lower gear  give people more time to reply to messages type of tool  It comes up in almost every conversation I have with a customer when I m talking about the different tools in Basecamp  they ask   Why am I going to use this versus that in this particular situation   Explaining not only the nuts and bolts of how to use it  but also why you would use this over that  that s the job the help site has to do at the end of the day  Adam  We ve talked about both of us a couple of times to make good support a differentiator for your product it s got to be human rather than robotic  or corporate  Do those qualities apply to this self serve support content as well  How do they manifest themselves there  Chase  They absolutely apply  If you think about your help site as an extension of your product  a feature of your product  it s kind of weird when you use a product and then you go over to the help site and it s completely different  You can tell two completely siloed teams worked on each one  You don t want that kind of feeling  You want it to just be this seamless experience going from one to the other and then back  When you start writing up your self serve content  use your own tone  use your own voice  use the language that you re using in the app itself  If you re telling people to post a message  use the phrase  post a message  rather than  submit a message   It s a different kind of voice  even in just like that one word change right there  Have your own tone  Have your own voice  Have fun with it  A lot of times you see help sites that are very vanilla  very off the shelf  templated  kind of robotic style  like it s an afterthought  Help sites don t have to be that way  Add in some videos  Add some gifs  Add some animations  If you go to the Campfire chat I was talking about earlier  we have a page that talks about Campfire  It s got screenshots on there  It s got gifs on there  It s got a video at the very top that shows you a real world situation where you would use it  All that is going to give the customer a better experience about answering their question  versus something like   We found this free WordPress theme and we just slapped it on there  and then we slapped some text in  and all this was done like six weeks after the feature came out   Again  treat it like a feature  Give it that same care and attention  Until the end of the internet Adam  Another thing people would notice visiting your help site is that you still have a lot of content there for Basecamp Classic and Basecamp 2  There s this idea that Basecamp   until the end of the internet   You aren t forcing anyone to update when the new product comes out  and you continue to support those older versions because you don t want to interrupt the way people work  What challenges does that bring from a support perspective  and how have you guys built your strategy around that  Chase  As a customer is there anything less terrifying than an email you get from a product that either says  A  we ve been bought  or B  we ve got this brand new version that you re going to love  Something is changing  and our customers are small business owners  They don t have time for change  They want steady  They want stable  They want Basecamp to be basically what it is today  tomorrow  Whether that s they re using our oldest version  Basecamp Classic  or if they re using our brand new Basecamp 3 version  That was our promise  Our promise is until the end of the internet we re dedicated to supporting our products there  so as long as we ve got power  as long as we ve got servers  as long as the internet is there in some kind of form  you are going to be able to use Basecamp Classic  which has been around for 12 years now  We ve got customers that still use Basecamp Classic  that love it  It does exactly what they need it to do  They re not going to change anytime soon,"[327 561 154 1390 1316 1145 610 985 691 609 406]"
339,training-dataset/product/599.txt,product,When the price is right  managing price segmentation44 Flares 44 Flares    Is price segmentation fair  One of the most valuable levers a company has when pricing its products is charging different customers different prices  also known as price segmentation  In essence  a company estimates a buyer s willingness to pay and does its best to charge as close to that as possible   Of course  there is no way to tell precisely how much a buyer is willing to pay  So instead companies use different statistics and techniques to divide up the customer base and ensure that those willing to pay more actually do  There are four main ways that companies do that  customer characteristics  transaction characteristics  behaviours and product portfolios  But the question is  is this really fair   What is fair   Fair is in the mind of the buyer  If a buyer thinks it s fair  then it is  On the other hand  when a buyer  or more importantly  when a lot of buyers  think it s unfair then it s a problem  In the early 2000s  Amazon used zip codes to help determine the price it would charge  People in wealthier areas were shown higher prices than those in less affluent areas  As a price segmentation scheme  this works exceptionally well  but when this was discovered and published  the outcry was huge  Amazon does not do this anymore   Price segmentation techniques  The question of fairness really differs depending on the segmentation technique used  Let s take a look   The first technique is customer characteristics  You have likely seen these as senior discounts or student discounts  It is also quite common  although Amazon found it to be a problem  to see these based on geography  For example  if you live in Florida you get a discount at Disney World  To make this feel fair to customers  set a high list price and then offer discounts to a specific group  As long as most people find that group reasonable  then they will see it as fair   A word of caution   there are certain customer characteristics  such as race  that should never be used for price segmentation  And while gender is sometimes used  for example for insurance or ladies night at a bar  be cautious here as well   Transaction characteristics are what you can learn at the time of the transaction that will help you understand your buyer s willingness to pay  For example  buyers who need it as soon as possible probably have a higher willingness to pay  Weather  season  day of week  time of day and purchase volume can be characteristics that may drive or indicate willingness to pay  Companies may offer a discount to a sporting event if the weather is bad for instance  Or they may offer discounts on winter clothes as spring approaches   How you present the differing prices matters though  Gas stations in the US used to have a 2c surcharge if customers paid with a credit card  They got a lot of push back  it didn t seem fair  Now they offer a 2c discount if customers pay with cash  It s the exact same thing to the company  but to the market one looks fair and one doesn t  As with customer characteristics  in most cases you are better off setting a high list price and then offering discounts   The third technique  behaviours  is about putting hurdles in front of buyers so they have to prove they are price sensitive  The easiest example of this is coupons  Some people use coupons  some don t  Those who do are more price sensitive  They are willing to invest the time and energy to find and use the coupon  That s the hurdle  As long as everyone has the ability to find and use the coupons  this technique is seen as fair   The final method for price segmentation is creating a product portfolio to get different buyers to select different products  First class versus economy class on an airplane is a great example  People pay a lot more for first class seats even though it s essentially the same experience as coach just with a little more room and a meal  By creating a different product  the airlines could get one segment to pay them significantly more  Creating high end versions of products and charging more for them is typically seen as fair   The problem with fairness and product portfolio pricing arises around race and gender  A department store had two identical versions of a baby doll except one was black and the other was white  So far that s OK  The problem was they were charging two different prices  It doesn t even matter which one was more expensive  there was no way that would be seen as fair   And the problem was fixed as soon as the store found out    As a whole  women s products are more expensive than men s products  And while we ve seen stories pop up in major new outlets about this periodically  any uproar around the topic seems to die out quickly  That s because often product pricing is defensible in this regard  For example  deodorant for men and women costs about the same to make  but women s is more expensive on average  However  because they are clearly different products with different brands it seems to be accepted  The bigger problem comes when the products are essentially the same except for colour or packaging  A department store  luckily not the same one  had two nearly identical bicycles  one blue the other pink  priced at two different prices  This is pretty hard to justify and it is easy to see why buyers found it unfair   Just because we can  does that mean we should   The good news is that buyers all over the world are used to seeing price segmentation  They have learned to accept most of it as fair  This gives companies a lot of leeway to charge more to some customers than they do to others  However  you want to be vigilant to stay on the good side of your customers  to make the price segmentation seem fair  The best advice to achieve this  put yourself in the shoes of each type of buyer  Would that buyer think it s fair   Just because we can segment on price  doesn t mean we should  But if we don t do it at all  or don t do it well  we leave a lot of money on the table  Segment carefully,"[339 1185 700 561

345,training-dataset/business/802.txt,business,How to Think About All Strategic Alliances   The Right Mindset and How to Make the Tough DecisionsStrategic Alliances  In the quest to build a business  alliances are key to growing quickly and building robustly  Partners with expertise  distribution  or resources that you don t have create a huge advantage over competitors   We ll take a broad look at partnerships  1  a high level view of the healthy mindset to carry into an alliance  and 2  strategic insights for choosing the best partners and executing well on those agreements   But First   A Companion Collection  Before we get into the goods  check out and bookmark  or better  pocket  James Cohane s Guide to Business Development   Partnerships  He s collected and categorized a great set of resources for those who want to go deeper into the when and how of partnerships  Huge thanks to Joe Mecca and Edson Rigonatti for sharing this awesome collection   It s a great follow up to the high level approach we ll take here  and makes it easy to dive in by section if you re looking for help on a particular topic   The Mindset of Strategic Alliances  Most partnerships end in failure  They fizzle  underperform  or blow up   only the minority deliver expected  or unexpectedly positive  results to all parties   The reasons for these failures are the interesting part  Most often  the trouble begins as a failure of mindset   one or more partners comes to the table with an attitude that sets a course for future disaster   This is corroborated by research done by Larraine Segil  who wrote a great column in Forbes about how to avoid failures of Strategic Alliances   My research into over 200 companies at Caltech  where I teach executive education in alliances  found that cultural incompatibility  whether differing company size  corporate culture  management personalities or national cultural differences  caused alliance failure more often than the business or financial considerations   In order to create successful partnerships  cultivate the correct mindset   and be certain that your potential partners have done the same   Serve Customers  Then Find Partners  Most partnership decisions begin by thinking  Who has what I need   then trying to get it  That default mindset is  clearly  not the right approach   Leyla Seka  who runs Desk com  now part of Salesforce  believes in approaching partnerships by thinking about whose Customers you can create the most value for  In this 30 minute talk hosted by Saastr  which was suggested by Rob McGrorty  she goes into the foundation required for healthy  beneficial partnerships   You should be seeking mutual benefit  and it s much easier to achieve that when you know you can deliver value for a partner   To find out whether you can deliver value for the partner   focus on their customers  Do you  demonstrably  create something that their customers use and appreciate   and hopefully already pay for   Have an attitude of service partnership  Everyone has made a failed run into a partnership with the  They have what I need  mindset  Brad Feld has a great short post  suggested by Itamar Goldminz  where he talks about his experiences with start ups attempting partnerships with big companies  which so often ended in failure   He eventually learned that this was a failure of mindset  and easily fixable   I decided I was thinking about it completely wrong  I came to these conversations wondering what the big company could do  Sure  I considered the skills and capabilities of the startup  but I was always trying to figure out and anticipate how the big company could help the startup   Wrong  wrong  wrong  wrong  wrong   If you assume the big company has no fundamental obligations to a startup  you can t get hurt too badly   This realization was a turning point for his approach to partnerships  What it really comes down to  though Feld never states it explicitly  is understanding and empathy   It s crucial to realize that partners are stakeholders in the partnership  not in your company  They will be  and should be  focused on their own agenda  and completely indifferent to your agenda   I realized that was a consistent pattern in my world  Large companies have whatever agenda they have  They have no responsibility to the small company beyond whatever legal contract exists  which often is heavily weighted in favor of the large company  Strategies change  Executives change  The macro changes  Exogenous forces  that the small company can do absolutely nothing about  regularly cause havoc for the large company   Instead of expecting something from the big company  you should be focusing on doing specific things that help the big company while advancing your goal as a small company   Never expect special treatment  Don t expect them to go out of their way for you  Have enough empathy for their situation to appreciate that there are forces at work that you may never know about  that affect your partnership   This is the core reason that partnerships can be so risky   you re not in control  and sometimes not even informed  of all of the variables that can affect the longevity and quality of the partnership   If you only read one thing   read this  Ray Stern is a veteran of big business partnerships and strategy  As a Senior Vice President at both Yahoo  and Intuit  creating and managing partnerships was a big part of his background  When he recommends a resource  you read it  Probably a couple times   He suggested Simple Rules for Making Alliances Work  from the Harvard Business Review  This article is full of high level wisdom and some very tactical advice  so no matter what business or type of partnership you re considering  there will be something valuable in it for you   The parts that seems most interesting  and counterintuitive  to me were about 1  the importance of openly discussing differences of culture   actually airing gripes about process and performance   A turning point came when some alliance executives began systematically documenting differences between the companies and then held working sessions with team members to discuss how those differences were being perceived and whether they might benefit the alliance if they weren t ignored or suppressed  Because many of the differences touched on sensitive issues concerning competencies and culture  people were initially reluctant to address them  preferring to focus on imagined or desired commonality  When the teams finally overcame their reluctance  frustration that had built up over many months came pouring out  and perceptions of each other were often expressed in negative or even inflammatory language   Over time  though  the partners were better able to view each other s qualities in a positive light   and 2  how important it is to take an extremely broad view of who the stakeholders are and will be in the partnership  and have the foresight to include them in the plans from the beginning   Though eminently reasonable  the conventional advice   to serve the partnership at all costs   is insufficient  Equally important  and often more difficult  is maintaining commitment from and alignment among the business units and functions  finance  legal  R D  sales  in your own company that are affected by the alliance or on whose contributions its success depends   Companies are not monolithic  yet alliance advice tends to gloss over this basic reality and treat partners as if they were simple  homogeneous entities  Although most counsel on alliances highlights the fundamental importance of trust  it rarely delves into what our research and experience indicate are the biggest barriers to trust  mixed messages  broken commitments  and unpredictable  inconsistent behavior from different segments of a partner organization   More Wisdom on Partnerships from Ray Stern  Through a lifetime of building partnerships at companies of all sizes  Ray has developed a sound Partnership Philosophy that he s been willing to share with us   This one slide is the blueprint to crafting any kind of partnership  from small business up through the Fortune 500  Each word is carefully chosen and none of these points can afford to be skipped   Directly from the desk of Ray Stern  Any time you find yourself approaching a potential partnership  or evaluating one   return to this set of fundamentals to ensure that your strategic alliance will have a sound foundation  and a chance for success   Strategic Decisions about Partnerships  One of the tough things about these kind of partnerships is that decisions constantly have to be made  re considered  and re made again  It s in their nature to have moving pieces  and be affected by a huge number of variables  known and unknown  that continually affect changes to the circumstances of the partnership   It s helpful to have some guiding ideas on how to think about these alliances  and what strategies you can approach them with   When to seek an Alliance  The most basic choice to make here isn t who to ally with   it s when  The stage you re at will determine the kind of partners who will make good fits  As a company looking to create a new capacity  in some way   a product  offering  service  etc  your three options are  Build  Buy  or Ally   We can see the basic decision inputs here  thanks to a slide taken from this presentation by Cisco  suggested by Itamar Goldminz   The Switchback Strategy  Partnership isn t a marriage  It doesn t have to be a more perfect union   til death do you part  Alliances exist only as long as strategic value exists and goals are aligned  Many companies are now partners who competed in the past   and many companies who partnered together are competitors today   This is a strategy that has been studied by researchers at Wharton  dubbed the Switchback Strategy  where companies temporarily either cooperate or compete with companies that it expects and hopes to have the opposite relationship with in the future   Here is the full academic paper about Strategic Switchbacks  and a much more user friendly article that sums up the information nicely  Thanks to Karan Khandpur for suggesting these   Here is an interesting excerpt on the temporary cooperation strategy   Start ups that want to sell directly to their customers but do not have the supporting infrastructure such as marketing and distribution can adopt the temporary cooperation switchback strategy      In the partnership  the start up learns from the corporation how to market its product  Eventually  the goal is to break free and go directly to customers   However  start ups have to be smart in the way they execute a temporary cooperation switchback strategy  It is important to ensure that the agreement with the partner is structured in a way that the start up can learn from the experience   And the temporary competition strategy   Start ups that are having a tough time finding a bigger partner to license their technology or through whom they could sell their products might wish to consider going to market themselves   at first  This is what Hsu and Marx call the temporary competition switchback  Compete in the market to prove the worth and usefulness of the product or technology as a way to get a future licensing deal or strategic alliance   This strategy would work for start ups facing skepticism from potential partners  which arise because the most valuable applications for the technology are not clear  could not be measured or because an industry standard has not yet emerged   The Perfect Case Study  Disney   Pixar  One of the most popular cases from Harvard Business School on the topic of Partnerships explores the strategic relationship between Disney   Pixar  You ll learn a lot from this short read about how their partnership developed  and the tough decisions that needed to be made as it evolved   They ve had a fascinating relationship   working together closely at times  negotiating hard  and learning huge amounts from each other through their cooperation  Here s a great example of the attitude that Steve Jobs  then at Pixar  brought to the thinking about this partnership   This three picture deal resulted in the 1995 hit film Toy Story  directed by Lasseter  which garnered more than  350 million in box office and video sales  making it the highest grossing film released in the United States that year  Yet from 1995 1998  Pixar earned only  56 million in revenue  When asked if he had regrets about inking the deal  Jobs said   None  no  we re working with the best in the business and we re learning a lot  We call it going to Disney University    You may notice some similar elements to the

362,training-dataset/business/932.txt,business,In 2016  I sold my startup for seven figures   and it ruined me In 2016  I sold my startup for seven figures  Here s the brutally honest truth that no one talks about when running and selling a business   The low confidence cynic in me wants to tell you that a seven figure exit isn t really that much  I have friends who have had eight figure exits  and I m met multiple people who have had 10 figure exits  This is my experience as a guy who started a business with  10k in personal credit card debt and  200 in the bank  and accidentally ended up a millionaire   Truth  1   it s fucking hard to get there  The house has a significant advantage on this bet  According to Forbes  8 out of 10 businesses fail within the first 18 months  In his amazing book  Mastering the Rockefeller Habits   Verne Harnish points out that of all businesses in the United States  only 4  make it to  1M in annual revenue  Only 0 4  of all businesses make it to  10M in annual revenue  We made it almost halfway through   It is an impossibly hard venture  however an estimated 543 000 new businesses open every single month  75  of them will never have a single employee  When I sold my startup  we had 100 people working with us  I m glad we got the stats out of the way  Now I can speak from the heart   Truth  2   money changed me for the worst  I love people   I love hanging out with them and I love making them happy  I love being around good people and the times I ve truly had non blood family have been some of the happiest of my life   Unfortunately  I no longer have very many friends  I worked so hard in my 20s and early 30s that I let my closest relationships lapse in the name of making money  It s tough to keep friends around when you re either working  or work is on your mind 24 7   Of the small amount of friends that I ve maintained  there are two distinct groups   those that met me when I didn t have much money  and those who met me when I had money   The friends that I ve maintained all along  and many of them are former employees  understand me  They understand my insatiable drive and the effort that it took to build a business and then sell it  They understand that every action and everything I do is with the greater good in mind   that s what made me a successful leader   The friends that I have made in the last few years do not understand  and that s 100  my fault   They see a spoiled  tone deaf asshole who they can t identify with  Success is intimidating to others  When you roll up to someone s house in a Tesla  how can they help but assume that you re just a judgmental asshole   Things like  300 pairs of jeans   450 pairs of boots  concrete countertops in your house  or trips to New Zealand no longer bother me  That s great and all  however when someone with money talks about these things to someone who is struggling to pay rent  you come across as a tone deaf asshole   I continually hurt those that I love most with my actions and words  Money isn t the root cause of this  but the fact that I have money and do not have to worry about paying rent or getting my car fixed  puts me in a position in which I have a very hard time identifying with those that do  I m working on it  but it s fucking hard  And I continually hurt those around me   just by being myself and it s beyond heartbreaking   Somewhere along the way  money truly changed me for the worst  I hope my experience writing this helps other successful entrepreneurs realize that family and friendships are what really matters in life  Not an ever growing bank account   Truth  3   the skills that make you a good leader DO NOT transfer to social settings  When you re a leader and you re constantly learning from others  you start doing things like hiring to your weaknesses while focusing on your strengths  You get really good at a specific skill set   in my case  this is hiring and retaining great employees  visioning  strategic planning  and company culture development  That s it  I m not overly good at anything else   What I ran my business  these specific skills were very valuable  If I were to step into another CEO role  I would use these same skills to  hopefully  be successful in that position   Here are several real life examples as to how trying to use this skill set in the real world backfired and I ended up looking like a total asshole  though I meant nothing but the best in each situation    I joined a local nonprofit board  They were struggling with some employee issues  while I owned a business that was not only growing but had the lowest turnover in an entire industry  I consider myself an expert in hiring and retention  This nonprofit did not see the value   I repeatedly heard from them that I was just a  boss  and that things were different because they were a nonprofit  I got frustrated and quit the board after a year  I should have stuck it out and learned to work with the group for the greater good  Since selling my business  I have been playing full time in a touring band  Our band got serious about strategic planning and role delineation  I consider myself an expert in these areas  so I took the reins and set some very aggressive goals  I did this largely without the input from the rest of the group  because I am confident in my strengths and thought that they respected my experience   As with example  1 that wasn t the case  I was overly aggressive and my strengths that I value in myself weren t seen by others  It led me to deeply hurting those that mean the most to me in life  all because I was trying to use my previous experience to benefit the group as a whole   In addition  these specific skills are all  soft  skills  I also play the violin  You either play the violin  or you don t  When it comes to hiring and treating people right  there are many grey areas  I ve spent a significant amount of time and money developing my leadership qualities  however many people in my life do not understand that these skills are very learned   Anyone can start a business  Not anyone can hire and retain employees  set clear vision  and execute on that vision  It s a learned skill that takes ridiculous amounts of practice  Just like playing the violin   Truth  4   the same charismatic attitude that makes you a good leader also makes you an asshole  Yesterday  I got told by someone I really care about that I looked at her  like a little girl  when we were having a conversation  The day before that  one of my very closest friends and someone who I love like family told me that she didn t feel her opinion mattered around me because she hadn t  made a million dollars    The horrible truth to being a formerly successful leader is that many things you say in a social setting will be analyzed in ways that you don t intend  I m a good listener overall  not great  but pretty good   and the fact that my actions were making these very respected and talented individuals feel worthless was not okay   Listening is an art  Talking over someone because you re an expert in an area and they are not is not okay   Truth  5   life post exit is not all happy times  A successful business with great employees gives you a purpose  You have a responsibility to those who choose to spend their lives working with you  Your efforts are literally supporting entire families and when there is a mutual appreciation  not only is it extremely rewarding  but everything else tends to fall into place   Now that I don t have a business  I used this as an opportunity to jump into playing music full time  I joined a band and attempted to use the same skill set that I ve spent my entire adult life refining  And it did nothing but cause pain   When you have no purpose  life is fucking empty  I have an amazing wife and a newborn who I adore with all my heart  but I m not cut out to be a stay at home parent   To my fellow entrepreneurs out there   I know you re constantly burned out  I know that you re dealing with the exact same shit after 10 years that you dealt with on day 1  I know it s incredibly lonely at the top  It sucks and it s challenging   However  please learn from my mistakes   try to enjoy the moment   Write the  story  of your business and your life  Keep your friends insanely close   Do whatever you need to do to prioritize a work life balance  or as Zappos says  a  work life integration     REALLY consider that buy out offer and if you will be truly happy after the fact  Material things do not make people happy  at all   The sad reality is that you can accomplish all of your goals and become a true expert while building incredible teams of employees and friends along the way   But the rest of the world doesn t give a fuck about you or your experience,"[362 667 1316 51 1390 883 1145 154 456 561 684]"

376,training-dataset/business/221.txt,business,Why Trello Failed to Build a  1 Billion  Business   Product HabitsIn 2011  Joel Spolsky launched his company Fog Creek s new product at TechCrunch Disrupt called Trello  It looked a lot like a whiteboard with sticky notes translated into a web browser and an iPhone App  Instead of physically moving a sticky note on a whiteboard  you could drag and drop cards on a board from your web browser   Within days  Trello succeeded in getting 131 000 eyeballs  22  of them signed up  The vision for Trello was to create a wide product that was so simple and useful  just about anyone could use it  It caught on like wildfire   It s also why Trello ultimately had to sell to Atlassian for  425 million when it could have become the next  1 billion SaaS application   In a blog post Spolsky wrote a couple months after launch  Joel presciently touched on the biggest challenge ahead    Making a major horizontal product that s useful in any walk of life is almost impossible to pull off  You can t charge very much  because you re competing with other horizontal products that can amortize their development costs across a huge number of users  It s high risk  high reward    Trello was successful building this horizontal product  achieving rapid growth to tens of millions of users and an acquisition of hundreds of millions of dollars  However  the one thing Trello didn t do a good job of was keeping track of it s paying customers   Trello was so focused on building its free customer base first and monetizing later  by the time it looked to its paid subscribers  it was too late they d already moved on  While that makes Trello a perfect complement to Atlassian s suite of enterprise productivity tools  it hampered the company from growing further on its own   Let s talk about the opportunity that Trello missed  and what it could have done instead   Why Trello Had to Sell  Trello is organized around a  kanban board  concept  Kanban was a system for lean manufacturing that Toyota popularized in the 1940s  The basic idea was that each  card  represented a product  part  or inventory  When a card moved around a board  it meant that something had been physically moved from a supplier to a factory   In practice  it looks like this   When Trello first started out  it was really technically challenging to create a board in a web browser where you could collaboratively drag and drop cards into lists  A lot of other SaaS tools at the time were big databases with a visual interface built on top  think  Salesforce   This basically created an architecture where you structured data in terms of leads  customers  or tasks   Trello came at this from the opposite direction  The product vision was to strip everything down and build around the visual idea of cards on boards  To get this to work  Trello implemented a bleeding edge stack  The single page web app basically worked as a shell that pulled all of the data from the servers in less than half a second  at under 250 kilobytes  After a user visited for the first time  they then cached the page so Trello would load even faster   They built their servers on top of Node and used MongoDB to store data so that the web app would load really fast  Everytime a user dragged a card to a new list  or changed the entry on a board  Trello pushed this data to every other browser with the board open almost instantly   The result was breathtakingly simple  You made a change to a board by dragging and dropping a card  and that change was reflected everywhere else in the world     All of this stuff was new at the time  and gave Trello a lot of runway  But by 2016  it wasn t as hard to a build beautiful and responsive web app like Trello  and you started seeing Kanban boards everywhere   GitHub builds Kanban boards in September 2016   Asana announces Kanban Boards in November 2016   Airtable Launches Kanban Boards in November 2016   Justin Rosenstein  co founder of Asana one of Trello s biggest competitors said   We definitely give Trello full credit  That is clearly the product that has done a good job pioneering this view   But Justin was equally unapologetic about copy catting Trello s board feature   We see Trello as a feature  not a product    Trello might have become a  1B  business if it looked like a  system of record  application the single source of truth for a company  Imagine if you could use Trello not just to track your marketing funnel  but to move information from your marketing board to your sales pipeline and product roadmap  Instead of having a separate Trello board for each team  you d have a big board for the entire company   Trello never became this  system of record   It was an strong visual metaphor that the competition ultimately copied  Ultimately  the Kanban board was a really cool UX feature  but not a difficult one to replicate   In SaaS  you don t win by getting there first or having the best idea  You win by continually solving the problem better  When you build a feature that s extremely popular or successful  the competition will steal it   Trello could have doubled down on upselling individual consumers to paid plans  They could have focused on building features for SMB customers  Or they could have expanded into the enterprise faster  Any one of these things would have led to a  1B  valuation  Let s talk about what Trello could have done with each path  starting with its consumer plan    1  Trello Didn t Monetize Free Fast Enough  It s possible to build a  1B  company with a freemium business model targeted toward consumers  In 2013  Dropbox was valued at  8B on  200M in revenue with 200M users six years after launch  This was before Dropbox had even launched a business plan the company s revenue primarily came from upselling free users to a  10 month plan   Three years after launch  Trello s growth in users looked on track to explode past Dropbox s levels  at 10 million in 2015  Dropbox had four million three years after launch   But Trello had a much harder time upselling free customers to its paid  Trello Gold  plan   The 2013 blog post that announced the launch of Trello Gold highlighted three main reasons users should pay  5 month for Trello   Customizable board backgrounds  250 megabyte attachments for each card in Trello  vs  10 megabytes on the free plan   Stickers and custom emoji  While everyone likes emojis  it s not a good enough reason to spend money on software  Dropbox s free plan gives away 2 GB of space  Its paid plan delivers 1TB of space 50x what users get for free   Trello s value proposition is harder to locate than Dropbox  which is exactly why Trello should have figured out early what features individual consumers were willing to pay for   Solution  Dig Into the Freemium Use Cases  Instead  Trello focused on building a freemium  horizontal product that everyone could use  and chose to figure out monetization later   Instead of focusing on building a wide product for everyone  Trello should have dug deeper into its use cases in the beginning to figure out why people were signing up  what they were using the product for  and what people found so valuable that they d be willing to pay to use Trello   If you have a broad product with a lot of applications  dive into all of the different use cases first   Is there a competitor that s able to do this or is already doing it today   What s the revenue potential for people using this use case   By doing research around your customer base and your competitor s customers  you can segment out the use cases with the highest lifetime value   Let s say Trello found out that of its freemium user base  lawyers  real estate agents  and designers had the highest revenue potential  They might have learned that while designers want access to a calendar in their Trello boards  lawyers want read only boards that they can share with clients   These were features that Trello already included in its business plan  but didn t emphasize in its marketing because they wanted to keep a wide focus  Instead  Trello could have created a separate landing page to re target free customers and upsell them to a paid plan according to their specific use cases   When you have a wide product  it s especially important to dig into the individual use cases for your product  because it allows you to build specialized features according to those verticals  If you don t want to build your business off of a freemium consumer product  you have options you can move up the ladder and build around SMBs    2  Trello s Product Wasn t Sticky Enough for SMBs  Even without a really valuable consumer business  Trello still could have become the default workflow tool in SaaS by doubling down on the SMB market  The problem was that Trello didn t always make itself central enough to a company s workflow to justify paying for it by the seat   The first paid plan that Trello launched was its Business Class for small to medium sized businesses in 2013  They charged a flat rate price of  200 year per organization before moving to a more traditional per seat SaaS pricing model   Trello Business Class costs  10 per user month  billed annually  and you get   Unlimited integrations across boards  Additional collaboration features  Read only views and privacy settings  When David Cancel  co founder of Drift  put the company s annual Trello bill on a slide  1 700 the entire team at Drift was shocked  As David says   There are only a couple of people using  Trello  day in  day out  Meanwhile  however  we were being charged based on the number of people that we had in the paid plan  So clearly there was a disconnect between the price we were paying and the value we were getting    David downgraded his team from the paid plan to the freemium plan   In a Forbes article Trello CEO Michael Pryor said   I don t want people to spend 10 hours in Trello every day  we don t sell ads so we don t do better engaging more of your time like a social media platform    That s okay  When you re charging SMBs by the seat  you don t have to optimize your product around getting users to log in more  But you have to find some other way to demonstrate the value of paying for your product across the company   So  what should Trello have done instead   Solution  Build Out Better Integrations for SMBs  Trello could have created a stickier business product by making sure that it was so deeply integrated with other tools  teams couldn t rip it out   Imagine the ability to open and close GitHub issues inside of Trello  Imagine if all of your Salesforce leads automatically opened and closed on a Trello board based on what you did inside of Salesforce  Trello would have become the dashboard for all of the other tools a company used something that would have been insanely valuable   Instead  Trello s main features were copy catted  When asked about building out boards for visually managing issues  GitHub s VP of Product Engineering explained that   Everyone was expecting it to be there and asking questions about why we didn t have it   So GitHub built boards   If you re building a horizontal SaaS app like Trello  segment your users by integration   What API integrations are people using   How much data is coming into my product and how much is going out   That gives a valuable lens into another type of use case for your product  If a lot of data is pouring from your product to a different one  it s a sign that the competition is heating up  By building out better integrations and new product features  you can pre empt the competition from stepping on your turf   The SaaS SMB market is hyper competitive  and it s easier than ever before for businesses to switch from one solution to another  You either have to outmaneuver the competition  or build staying power by moving upmarket to the enterprise    3  Trello Didn t Build for the Enterprise  Moving upstream and targeting the enterprise market is a proven model for SaaS  Slack is doing it with the launch of its Enterprise Grid  Trello could have built a  1B  business by doing the same  moving into the enterprise market faster   Less than a year after Trello launched its enterprise sales strategy in 2015  the company hit a milestone of  10 million in ARR  In an interview  Trello s VP of Sales  Kristen Habacht writes that Trello follows a pretty basic land and expand enterprise sales strategy    For our enterprise team we ll look at  customers  who have really high Trello user counts  A lot of our outbound sales strategy is just reaching out to those accounts and saying   Hey you have 2 000  people on Trello  who can we talk to about that     10 million in ARR isn t anything to sneeze at  The problem with Trello s enterprise sales strategy is that it was only built on top of the reality that people in a company were already using Trello  A company s sales  marketing  and product teams might each use a bunch of different Trello boards  But what s harder is organizing the entire company around Trello   Solution  Become the System of Record for the Enterprise  The question that Trello should have been asking itself is   How do we integrate with higher end systems that larger companies are using and make ourselves indispensable to companies by becoming a core part of their workflow    One way to do it is to take the Slack strategy  As Slack grew  the company was razor focused on how it spread from individuals  to teams  to entire companies catching like wildfire   The big challenge that Slack found is that unlike a sales CRM or a marketing analytics tool  almost everyone on a small team has veto power over a productivity tool  So  Slack spent six months in private beta observing their customer base and educating them around the need for an internal communication tool in the first place  They optimized their onboarding flow around a north star metric of 2 000 messages sent within an organization  Today  93  of those companies are still using Slack   The vision behind Slack s enterprise product is that it allows organizations to  create more or less any kind of structure  with Slack  Functionally  Slack is a different product for the Enterprise  Teams within a company can organize themselves into  workspaces  and form divisions according to their organizational structure  Because Slack was so focused on figuring out how and why its product spread from small teams  to departments  to larger organizations  it was able to pinpoint key problems for the enterprise and solve them with the Enterprise Grid   Large enterprise companies love flexibility and configurability  Like Slack  Trello could have carved out a seat at the enterprise table by allowing large companies to configure Trello to their organizational charts  Trello s advantage is that it s already an extremely versatile and easy to use product  By providing companies structure between departments  Trello might have worked as the connective tissue holding a company together   Congratulations  Trello  Hindsight  of course  is 20 20  While I ve spent most of this post talking about Trello s missed opportunity  we shouldn t forget that building a SaaS business that s worth over  10M  let alone one that s worth  425M  is a huge accomplishment   Trello and the team at Fog Creek paid for Trello out of pocket  Trello has been a huge success since the moment Joel launched it at TechCrunch Disrupt  The team grew it to 500 000 users within two years  and 4 75M users within four years before raising any money  They built an amazing product that was way ahead of its time  It was simple  elegant  and easy to use   A couple months ago  I tweeted     That s the impact that Trello has had on SaaS  and you see it everywhere  from GitHub to Jira   But if you wan t to build the next  1B  SaaS app  you have to remember to constantly evolve on top of your product  Don t build around any one single feature that the competition can rip out  Alternatively  make that one single feature so deeply

380,training-dataset/product/1383.txt,product,The introvert s guide to surviving design industry eventsI am a friendly person  I smile on a regular basis  chat with folks at the water cooler  and discuss the weather with people in elevators  Small get togethers with close friends are my jam   But drop me in a social gathering of more than about 5 other people and I ll start acting like a social leper  wishing I had the option to walk across hot coals while stabbing my eyes out with sticks rather than suffering through trying to socialize with the room full of strangers   At design industry drinkups  my solution used to be to grab a vodkatini and quickly drink it while I hid in the corner  I figured once I d gotten one drink down  I could check off  socialize with others while at the event  from my list and flee the scene   As a designer  this was problematic because I love networking with other designers and hearing about what they re working on   But a couple of years ago  I attended a conference panel session that changed everything for me from an event networking standpoint  I d like to share the quick tips I learned that have worked especially well for me ever since and not one involves a vodkatini   Look for yourself in the crowd  The panelist recommended that you look around the room  find someone who looks as uncomfortable as you feel  and go talk to them   A session attendee raised his hand and asked   But what if the person doesn t want to talk  and they think I m a weirdo for approaching them    The panelist s answer    Think about it this way  One of 4 things will likely happen   The person is also an introvert and will be relieved and grateful to have someone to talk to The person is not an introvert  but will still chat and become a new professional connection The person will need to exit the scene and will excuse him or herself The person will be obnoxious and rude  In the event that number 4 happens  who cares  You don t know this person  You ll likely never have to speak to them ever again  You have nothing to lose    I ve employed this advice at every single networking event I ve attended since  and it s always worked like a charm  I ve even had several people thank me for rescuing them   Use your social network to connect in real life  Post an update on LinkedIn and Twitter asking if anyone is at the event  and if so ask if they would like to link up for coffee food a between session high five  People are very receptive to this approach   Meet in a public place  obviously  just in case the person is a designer by day serial killer by night   I did this at the last 2 conferences I attended and got a great response  I met several designers who I ve stayed in touch with   Don t push yourself so hard that you burn out and don t enjoy the event  Take a break when you need one  There s no reason you need to spend every single waking second networking when you attend a conference  It s okay to skip a session and go crash in your hotel room to recharge your social interaction battery every once in a while   Being an introvert shouldn t stop you from presenting  It took me years to take the plunge and present at a conference   Why did I finally go for it  A friend told me it wasn t fair to the community to keep all of my experiences to myself  when I could potentially make a positive impact on the work of others  That shove  or guilt trip  however you d like to look at it  was the catalyst that got me to come out from behind my laptop   I still get really nervous and need to crash for about an hour after I present  In fact  after one particularly long session  I grabbed my lunch and legit went and hid in my car to blast some music and decompress   Even though I feel pretty drained after presenting  I ve started to enjoy speaking at events  Having people come up after the session to say that they can t wait to employ the research method I presented  or to tell me that they believe the internal process flows I described will dramatically improve their inter departmental relationships  makes it all worthwhile   What I m trying to say is this  Don t count yourself out just because you re an introvert  The things you know could really help other people in the industry   This is me giving you the same shove guilt trip my friend gave me  Get out there and share your knowledge,"[380 602 1316 478 154 1145 561 553 612 667 1045]"

406,training-dataset/product/1510.txt,product,Talking tech with non tech peopleExplaining complex software to customers who may not have a technical background certainly has its challenges  Frustration for both parties is just one misinterpreted comment away  That s why it s really important to get it right every time  We have developers at our company and we have customers  and as a senior lead on our customer support team  I sit right in between them  An analogy I sometimes use is that I m like an API between our developers and our customers  But for a lot of people out there it s necessary to explain what an API is  I have a very technical background  but how do I go about explaining what an API is to someone who might not  How are you supposed to talk tech with non tech people  There s a big difference between knowing something and being able to explain it to someone else  Since I ve been doing the explaining part every day for the past few years  I ve come up with four tips that are important when talking technical with someone who may not have the same technical background and skill set  Don t assume anything  Bad assumptions lead to you sleeping outside in the mountains  When you re talking to your customers  you can t assume they know everything and are as smart as Einstein  Equally  you can t assume they only know as much as Nick Lachey  When you get a customer query in  you know nothing about that customer  It helps to use software that gives you a bunch of customer data along with the query  Knowing her job title  how long she s used your product  and how much she pays you  will help you know how you should communicate with her  Being able to look at past conversations is also valuable  as you have to assume less about your customer  Luckily Intercom provides all of that for you  which is one of the many reasons we use Intercom to provide support for Intercom  Language is important  If this was the first image in this post  most of you would have assumed it wasn t for you  You can scare people away with the wrong language  If you send a customer a response using the wrong language  the entire response gets lost on them   no matter how useful the information it contains  It s important to strike the right balance between clarity and brevity when responding to a customer  If you re talking to a customer about a problem with their database  you can bring up their Mongo perf or you can talk about how quickly their site loads  You can see that even though you re referring to the same thing  they look and sound very different to a customer  Be able to explain things in multiple ways We ve all played Pictionary with someone who draws       You don t know what it is so you guess  bird    Then they draw       You hesitantly guess  upside down bird    So they once again draw       You just stare at them like an idiot until they rip off the top sheet of paper and start with a completely blank slate  only to draw       Then you quit the game  because they are the worst at Pictionary  Then you quit the game  because they are the worst at Pictionary  You definitely don t want to make your customers feel like that  When you re talking to them  it s important to be able to explain something in more than one way   You should be able to offer up answers in a bunch of different formats and places  like a numbered list  emails with images and gifs  a phone call  or directing them to your help documentation  Different things resonate with different people  Think like the customer,"[406 327 154 691 610 561 1248 584 283 1316 1045]"
418,training-dataset/product/15.txt,product,Designing for AlexaWaveform   source  Pixabay     This post is part of our  5 Questions  series  where we go behind the scenes with speakers from our 2017 O Reilly Design Conference   I recently asked Phillip Hunter  head of UX for Alexa Skills at Amazon  to discuss the complexities of designing for voice interactions  common missteps  and the role voice will play in human device interactions  At the O Reilly Design Conference  Phillip will be presenting a session  Amazon Alexa  What  why  and why now   You re presenting a talk at the O Reilly Design Conference called Amazon Alexa  What  why  and why now  Tell me what attendees should expect   We ve been thrilled to see the customer and developer reaction to Alexa  This talk will address our vision for Alexa  where we are at today and how attendees can take part in continued growth  There are still hard problems to solve with voice we ve spent years of invention on this but we believe voice interactions will play an ever increasing role in the future of everyday computing   What advice do you have for designers and developers interested in building voice driven products and services   It can be easy to underestimate how hard it is to separate our tacit knowledge of speech and thought from the practice of designing for it  Good voice interaction design demands that we deconstruct even our own individual behaviors and what we assume about the behavior of others  Human conversation is highly intricate and deeply evolved  Use the design skills you have to dive deeply into not just the functional needs of a voice app  but into how the what and why of interaction is different for voice   What I ll also touch on in my conversation is the set of tools developers can take advantage of to integrate voice into their products  For Alexa specifically  with the availability of the Alexa Skills Kit and Alexa Voice Service  you don t need to have a background in natural language understanding or speech recognition to build great voice experiences with Alexa   Do you think voice driven experiences will be the interaction model of the future   We believe that voice will fundamentally improve the way people will interact with technology  It can make the complex simple it s the most natural and convenient user interface  Like all advances in human device interaction  voice is additive as both a medium and a magnifier of ease and power  It is part of the future of interaction  and will likely replace some ways that we currently do things  However  voice isn t meant to replace other forms of input  Voice will be the sole medium in some cases  and be augmenting or complementary in others  I expect to see plenty of innovation based on voice forward interactions  and continued innovation in what is already established   What are some of the biggest challenges or missteps  when developing for voice interaction   The two most common mistakes are 1  treating voice as an interrogative  form filling medium driven by impersonal questions and demanding exact answers  and 2  overloading the audio channel with information that is too much or too dense  Both of these tend to be made when the advice above isn t taken into account   What other sessions or workshops  are you interested in attending at the O Reilly Design Conference   Several speakers will be addressing next generation topics that touch on designing for multi device environments  I expect a lot of good discussion points to be raised  And I m always mindful of what and how we re instructing the next sets of UX leaders and practitioners  A couple of talks around those topics look interesting,"[418 164 157 632 782 878 65 369 610 380 680]"
421,training-dataset/product/457.txt,product,Lessons and Challenges from Building Our Transparent Product RoadmapLessons and Challenges from Building Our Transparent Product Roadmap  By Jim Hitch  Buffer is known for being transparent in radical ways  We share our revenue  We share the diversity of our team  We share our cultural evolutions and learnings  We share our salaries   We keep sharing because we keep learning so much along the way  So many of you participate in discussions and help us shape the Buffer path  And we re inspired when we hear that our story might have helped you shape yours   So you might imagine my reaction when I saw this blog post from Trello  Going Public  Roadmapping With a Public Trello Board  It reminded me of Trello s own public roadmap and some others  too   Thanks  Trello  for leading the way and highlighting others who are sharing their product plans    I thought   We should do that    VIEW BUFFER S TRANSPARENT PRODUCT ROADMAP ON TRELLO   We already have an amazing amount of ideas from the community in our UserVoice forum  We re regularly sharing prototypes made with InVision  We speak with customers all the time  Why not share our feature roadmap   So I shared Trello s blog post and idea of a Buffer transparent product roadmap with a few teammates   As I spoke with various folks around the company   Hannah one of our newest Onboarding Heroes for Buffer for Business   Hailley PR Crafter   Joel and Leo  other product types   I found a common thread   Our quarterly goal documents are great  but they re quite scattered around  And with so many product teams  it can be a chore to get a high level answer to simple questions like   What s the latest   or  What s up next    We shared a roadmap Trello board with the team  and it seems to be really helping us   Introducing the Buffer transparent product roadmap  So today we wanted to open it up and share it with you as well  Now we can build in the open  with all of you alongside   You might be asking   Isn t this sort of risky  Telling everyone   even your competition   what you re working on    Great question  We re definitely opening ourselves up a bit here  Thing is  we believe this could be better for everyone in the long term  not just Buffer  Let me explain   Why build in the open   Building in the open could positively impact   The Buffer team  It encourages us to think more long term and be more deliberate about what we build  hopefully resulting in us building more value for you   It encourages us to think more long term and be more deliberate about what we build

that s a good thing  Maybe they ll see something we re working on and fill the need a little differently  Or they ll be inspired to build a similar feature  For us  this is more than OK  It s not a zero sum game  after all  There s plenty of opportunity for everyone to be successful  All in all  we think this could raise the bar for all of us  and challenge Buffer to build the best  most valuable features possible   Yes  even our competitors could be better off  And that s a good thing  Maybe they ll see something we re working on and fill the need a little differently  Or they ll be

raise the bar for all of us  and challenge Buffer to build the best  most valuable features possible  The marketing community at large  If by building in the open we all learn together  we hope that some of the challenges facing our community will be addressed just a little more quickly   If by building in the open we all learn together  we hope that some of the challenges facing our community will be addressed just a little more quickly  Our collective audience  Better tools in the hands of marketers have the potential to make better marketing  And in doing so make consumers better off   Better tools in the hands of marketers have the potential to make better marketing  And in doing so make consumers better off  The startup and business community  Buffer was once a couple of founders working from a bedroom  and we still have a lot to learn  By sharing our failures and successes  we d love to play a small part in helping people fulfill their dreams and start a company  or grow an existing company in a more effective way   What building in public has taught us already  Here are a few examples of what we re learning so far   Lesson One  Embrace the power of prototyping  A prototype is a great conversation starter   In the process of building a new reporting feature for Buffer for Business  we needed some feedback and shared this wireframe in an email to the community   I was amazed to hop into InVision the next morning to see all of these comments  Big hat tip to InVision here for making it dead simple for anyone to click on the design and leave their comment right in line   Each pink dot represents a customer conversation   Lesson Two  Let the community connect  Feedback has a beautiful way of compounding   Take a look at how the Buffer community interacts here   Lesson Three  Look at the forest  not just each tree  It s so helpful to be guided by the community to the highest priority features  Take a look at early voting on these few items  There s great momentum around creating unique content for each network   Want to cast some votes yourself  Take a quick second to log in to Trello  you can use a Google account and not even need to create a new password     Lesson Four  Keep drinking from the firehose   We re fortunate to have ideas coming to happiness heroes  to UserVoice  to our Customer Development team  to InVision prototypes  and more  How can we actually make use of it all  Well  I have to say  it can be a tough task   Sometimes we can incorporate it into the feature under construction  Sometimes it s stored away for a future version  Sometimes it simply adds to our level of empathy and understanding of our community   One thing s constant  How grateful we are for the time and thought that you ve taken to share with us   We still have a long way to go here  but my hope is that we keep asking  keep sharing  and keep having this conversation   Lesson Five  Strive for a higher standard  We re communicating this publicly  so the stakes are higher   On one hand  if we change direction we ll want to communicate even more with you  We re committed to doing our best in this   On the other hand  we re fully aware that the  Next Up  column will be something that you may build plans around   We don t want to let you down  So we ll need to increase our discipline early in the process to be sure we re quite committed to something before publishing it on the roadmap   A few potential challenges of transparent building  As with many things  we have some challenges on this path too  Here s a little view into three of those   Challenge One  Startup projects need freedom  We have three startup projects underway at the moment  Pablo  Respond and Content Library   They re all early in their lives  and early in their search for what entrepreneurs call product market fit   As we search for their place in the market  sometimes we might need to make bigger changes with less advance warning  That can be tough with a published roadmap   How will we keep this up to date and and helpful  while still giving the teams freedom to find the best path  We ll be working on that   Challenge Two  It takes time and effort to share all of this   Beyond today  who will maintain the transparent roadmap  How frequently will it need to be updated   And how does the feedback we ll receive work in tune with UserVoice  comments on InVision prototypes  and all the ideas from our customer happiness conversations  How much time will it take to incorporate those thoughts into 5 product teams and 2 mobile engineering teams   We don t know the answers to all of these questions  but I m keen to embrace a good portion of it in hopes that all the context will help me be the best product leader I can be for Buffer   and for you  the community   Challenge Three  Communicating with clarity  The roadmap is intentionally very high level  with just a short phrase to describe each potential feature or change   Is that enough for you to know what it is and whether it ll be helpful or not  I m not sure   Our fantastic design team is eager to add context here by showing their design process  including early prototypes  That sounds like a great addition to me  but I m not 100  confident we re sharing enough   If you d be up for helping out by providing any feedback or thoughts as we get going here  we d all really appreciate it   How the Roadmap Works  If you re intrigued by all of this and want to be part of how Buffer evolves  thank you  It means so much that you d take time and energy from your own life and work to share in this story with us   Here are a few places to get involved   The Roadmap  Please add your votes and comments for any features that you re eager to use   You can log into Trello through an existing Google account and not even need to create a new password    Our UserVoice forum  Want to add your thoughts or suggest another idea  This is the place  Beta groups  We form beta groups around new features from time to time  Typically we ll invite you to join while inside Buffer  Please take us up on that if you re keen   Over to you   We re looking forward to you joining us on the journey  Please jump in and let us know what you think as we build in the open   And by the way  here s a quick rundown of friends who helped shape our transparent roadmap   Joel shared the idea of making an  introduction lane  to help newcomers know what to expect   Steve helped sort out some design elements   Niel  Dan  Sunil and Joel suggested turning the voting feature on   Dave  Steve  James  Tyler and Lorenz got excited about sharing early designs in the card  More is on the way   Hannah and Amy were some of the first to share the board with customers for feedback   Kevan incorporated it into a recent email to our Buffer for Business community   We like to keep them in the loop as early as possible so they can best serve their team and clients    P S  Get all our posts

439,training-dataset/business/691.txt,business,What meetings should my startup be having July 28  2016    I tried to find the fugliest stock photo of a meeting  Did I win   One of the issues I see in early stage startups when they get beyond  two people in a garage  is that they don t consider how important synchronous information transmission can be for making sure people are on the same page  You ve got one  two  three folks who largely share a brain  and are constantly sharing information   so why would need to create structure around this sharing  right   Further  because they re constantly pushing  and always on  they don t consider the importance of cadenced checkpoints to measure the progress against their goals  and reevaluate that their previously agreed goals should continue to be their goals  You resist doing this when you have a huge pile of wood to chop  and instead just chop and chop and chop   Lastly  because  meetings  feel like a big company thing  and man  we ain t got time for that  group chat  email  and anything dear god other than a meeting  will stand in  instead  Startups will actively avoid having recurring meetings  thinking that they are inherently problematic  rather than just being poorly done at the companies they previously worked at    But when you get beyond three people sharing a brain  there is definitely a need for structured information sharing and cadenced checkpoints for evaluation and reflections  Not executing on that leads to serious opportunity costs  confusion  and assorted brain damage   For all of these reasons  I see early stage  and even mid stage startups lacking a solid internal meeting cadence   and it totally shows in their level of engineering  sales  and customer success execution  And that s a bummer  because it can end up killing your company  or at least dragging on your growth    Meetings are important for your company  Get over yourself   To help with this  I wrote up this reference architecture to share with some of the companies I ve invested in and advise  so they can jump forward on that learning curve  and have an intentional  efficient  set of meetings with which to run their organizations  Your company might get value out of it too  This is the Google Docs version   19 Kudos,"[439 249 602 169 1145 799 1316 289 1390 51 154]"

456,training-dataset/business/526.txt,business,How to Do What You Love        Want to start a startup  Get funded by Y Combinator   January 2006    To do something well you have to like it  That idea is not exactly novel  We ve got it down to four words   Do what you love   But it s not enough just to tell people that  Doing what you love is complicated     The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids  When I was a kid  it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition  Life had two states  some of the time adults were making you do things  and that was called work  the rest of the time you could do what you wanted  and that was called playing  Occasionally the things adults made you do were fun  just as  occasionally  playing wasn t for example  if you fell and hurt yourself  But except for these few anomalous cases  work was pretty much defined as not fun     And it did not seem to be an accident  School  it was implied  was tedious because it was preparation for grownup work     The world then was divided into two groups  grownups and kids  Grownups  like some kind of cursed race  had to work  Kids didn t  but they did have to go to school  which was a dilute version of work meant to prepare us for the real thing  Much as we disliked school  the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse  and that we had it easy     Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work was not fun  Which is not surprising  work wasn t fun for most of them  Why did we have to memorize state capitals instead of playing dodgeball  For the same reason they had to watch over a bunch of kids instead of lying on a beach  You couldn t just do what you wanted     I m not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want  They may have to be made to work on certain things  But if we make kids work on dull stuff  it might be wise to tell them that tediousness is not the defining quality of work  and indeed that the reason they have to work on dull stuff now is so they can work on more interesting stuff later    1      Once  when I was about 9 or 10  my father told me I could be whatever I wanted when I grew up  so long as I enjoyed it  I remember that precisely because it seemed so anomalous  It was like being told to use dry water  Whatever I thought he meant  I didn t think he meant work could literally be fun fun like playing  It took me years to grasp that     Jobs    By high school  the prospect of an actual job was on the horizon  Adults would sometimes come to speak to us about their work  or we would go to see them at work  It was always understood that they enjoyed what they did  In retrospect I think one may have  the private jet pilot  But I don t think the bank manager really did     The main reason they all acted as if they enjoyed their work was presumably the upper middle class convention that you re supposed to  It would not merely be bad for your career to say that you despised your job  but a social faux pas     Why is it conventional to pretend to like what you do  The first sentence of this essay explains that  If you have to like something to do it well  then the most successful people will all like what they do  That s where the upper middle class tradition comes from  Just as houses all over America are full of chairs that are  without the owners even knowing it  nth degree imitations of chairs designed 250 years ago for French kings  conventional attitudes about work are  without the owners even knowing it  nth degree imitations of the attitudes of people who ve done great things     What a recipe for alienation  By the time they reach an age to think about what they d like to do  most kids have been thoroughly misled about the idea of loving one s work  School has trained them to regard work as an unpleasant duty  Having a job is said to be even more onerous than schoolwork  And yet all the adults claim to like what they do  You can t blame kids for thinking  I am not like these people  I am not suited to this world      Actually they ve been told three lies  the stuff they ve been taught to regard as work in school is not real work  grownup work is not  necessarily  worse than schoolwork  and many of the adults around them are lying when they say they like what they do     The most dangerous liars can be the kids  own parents  If you take a boring job to give your family a high standard of living  as so many people do  you risk infecting your kids with the idea that work is boring    2   Maybe it would be better for kids in this one case if parents were not so unselfish  A parent who set an example of loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive house    3      It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke free from the idea of making a living  Then the important question became not how to make money  but what to work on  Ideally these coincided  but some spectacular boundary cases  like Einstein in the patent office  proved they weren t identical     The definition of work was now to make some original contribution to the world  and in the process not to starve  But after the habit of so many years my idea of work still included a large component of pain  Work still seemed to require discipline  because only hard problems yielded grand results  and hard problems couldn t literally be fun  Surely one had to force oneself to work on them     If you think something s supposed to hurt  you re less likely to notice if you re doing it wrong  That about sums up my experience of graduate school     Bounds    How much are you supposed to like what you do  Unless you know that  you don t know when to stop searching  And if  like most people  you underestimate it  you ll tend to stop searching too early  You ll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents  or the desire to make money  or prestige or sheer inertia     Here s an upper bound  Do what you love doesn t mean  do what you would like to do most this second  Even Einstein probably had moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee  but told himself he ought to finish what he was working on first     It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they did so much that there was nothing they d rather do  There didn t seem to be any sort of work I liked that much  If I had a choice of  a  spending the next hour working on something or  b  be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about  was there any sort of work I d prefer  Honestly  no     But the fact is  almost anyone would rather  at any given moment  float about in the Carribbean  or have sex  or eat some delicious food  than work on hard problems  The rule about doing what you love assumes a certain length of time  It doesn t mean  do what will make you happiest this second  but what will make you happiest over some longer period  like a week or a month     Unproductive pleasures pall eventually  After a while you get tired of lying on the beach  If you want to stay happy  you have to do something     As a lower bound  you have to like your work more than any unproductive pleasure  You have to like what you do enough that the concept of  spare time  seems mistaken  Which is not to say you have to spend all your time working  You can only work so much before you get tired and start to screw up  Then you want to do something else even something mindless  But you don t regard this time as the prize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn it     I put the lower bound there for practical reasons  If your work is not your favorite thing to do  you ll have terrible problems with procrastination  You ll have to force yourself to work  and when you resort to that the results are distinctly inferior     To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only enjoy  but admire  You have to be able to say  at the end  wow  that s pretty cool  This doesn t mean you have to make something  If you learn how to hang glide  or to speak a foreign language fluently  that will be enough to make you say  for a while at least  wow  that s pretty cool  What there has to be is a test     So one thing that falls just short of the standard  I think  is reading books  Except for some books in math and the hard sciences  there s no test of how well you ve read a book  and that s why merely reading books doesn t quite feel like work  You have to do something with what you ve read to feel productive     I think the best test is one Gino Lee taught me  to try to do things that would make your friends say wow  But it probably wouldn t start to work properly till about age 22  because most people haven t had a big enough sample to pick friends from before then     Sirens    What you should not do  I think  is worry about the opinion of anyone beyond your friends  You shouldn t worry about prestige  Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world  When you can ask the opinions of people whose judgement you respect  what does it add to consider the opinions of people you don t even know    4      This is easy advice to give  It s hard to follow  especially when you re young    5   Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy  It causes you to work not on what you like  but what you d like to like     That s what leads people to try to write novels  for example  They like reading novels  They notice that people who write them win Nobel prizes  What could be more wonderful  they think  than to be a novelist  But liking the idea of being a novelist is not enough  you have to like the actual work of novel writing if you re going to be good at it  you have to like making up elaborate lies     Prestige is just fossilized inspiration  If you do anything well enough  you ll make it prestigious  Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first  Jazz comes to mind though almost any established art form would do  So just do what you like  and let prestige take care of itself     Prestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious  If you want to make ambitious people waste their time on errands  the way to do it is to bait the hook with prestige  That s the recipe for getting people to give talks  write forewords  serve on committees  be department heads  and so on  It might be a good rule simply to avoid any prestigious task  If it didn t suck  they wouldn t have had to make it prestigious     Similarly  if you admire two kinds of work equally  but one is more prestigious  you should probably choose the other  Your opinions about what s admirable are always going to be slightly influenced by prestige  so if the two seem equal to you  you probably have more genuine admiration for the less prestigious one     The other big force leading people astray is money  Money by itself is not that dangerous  When something pays well but is regarded with contempt  like telemarketing  or prostitution  or personal injury litigation  ambitious people aren t tempted by it  That kind of work ends up being done by people who are  just trying to make a living    Tip  avoid any field whose practitioners say this   The danger is when money is combined with prestige  as in  say  corporate law  or medicine  A comparatively safe and prosperous career with some automatic baseline prestige is dangerously tempting to someone young  who hasn t thought much about what they really like     The test of whether people love what they do is whether they d do it even if they weren t paid for it even if they had to work at another job to make a living  How many corporate lawyers would do their current work if they had to do it for free  in their spare time  and take day jobs as waiters to support themselves     This test is especially helpful in deciding between different kinds of academic work  because fields vary greatly in this respect  Most good mathematicians would work on math even if there were no jobs as math professors  whereas in the departments at the other end of the spectrum  the availability of teaching jobs is the driver  people would rather be English professors than work in ad agencies  and publishing papers is the way you compete for such jobs  Math would happen without math departments  but it is the existence of English majors  and therefore jobs teaching them  that calls into being all those thousands of dreary papers about gender and identity in the novels of Conrad  No one does that kind of thing for fun     The advice of parents will tend to err on the side of money  It seems safe to say there are more undergrads who want to be novelists and whose parents want them to be doctors than who want to be doctors and whose parents want them to be novelists  The kids think their parents are  materialistic   Not necessarily  All parents tend to be more conservative for their kids than they would for themselves  simply because  as parents  they share risks more than rewards  If your eight year old son decides to climb a tall tree  or your teenage daughter decides to date the local bad boy  you won t get a share in the excitement  but if your son falls  or your daughter gets pregnant  you ll have to deal with the consequences     Discipline    With such powerful forces leading us astray  it s not surprising we find it so hard to discover what we like to work on  Most people are doomed in childhood by accepting the axiom that work   pain  Those who escape this are nearly all lured onto the rocks by prestige or money  How many even discover something they love to work on  A few hundred thousand  perhaps  out of billions     It s hard to find work you love  it must be  if so few do  So don t underestimate this task  And don t feel bad if you haven t succeeded yet  In fact  if you admit to yourself that you re discontented  you re a step ahead of most people  who are still in denial  If you re surrounded by colleagues who claim to enjoy work that you find contemptible  odds are they re lying to themselves  Not necessarily  but probably     Although doing great work takes less discipline than people think because the way to do great work is to find something you like so much that you don t have to force yourself to do it finding work you love does usually require discipline  Some people are lucky enough to know what they want to do when they re 12  and just glide along as if they were on railroad tracks  But this seems the exception  More often people who do great things have careers with the trajectory of a ping pong ball  They go to school to study A  drop out and get a job doing B  and then become famous for C after taking it up on the side     Sometimes jumping from one sort of work to another is a sign of energy  and sometimes it s a sign of laziness  Are you dropping out  or boldly carving a new path  You often can t tell yourself  Plenty of people who will later do great things seem to be disappointments early on  when they re trying to find their niche     Is there some test you can use to keep yourself honest  One is to try to do a good job at whatever you re doing  even if you don t like it  Then at least you ll know you re not using dissatisfaction as an excuse for being lazy  Perhaps more importantly  you ll get into the habit of doing things well     Another test you can use is  always produce  For example  if you have a day job you don t take seriously because you plan to be a novelist  are you producing  Are you writing pages of fiction  however bad  As long as you re producing  you ll know you re not merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate  The view of it will be obstructed by the all too palpably flawed one you re actually writing      Always produce  is also a heuristic for finding the work you love  If you subject yourself to that constraint  it will automatically push you away from things you think you re supposed to work on  toward things you actually like   Always produce  will discover your life s work the way water  with the aid of gravity  finds the hole in your roof     Of course  figuring out what you like to work on doesn t mean you get to work on it  That s a separate question  And if you re ambitious you have to keep them separate  you have to make a conscious effort to keep your ideas about what you want from being contaminated by what seems possible    6      It s painful to keep them apart  because it s painful to observe the gap between them  So most people pre emptively lower their expectations  For example  if you asked random people on the street if they d like to be able to draw like Leonardo  you d find most would say something like  Oh  I can t draw   This is more a statement of intention than fact  it means  I m not going to try  Because the fact is  if you took a random person off the street and somehow got them to work as hard as they possibly could at drawing for the next twenty years  they d get surprisingly far  But it would require a great moral effort  it would mean staring failure in the eye every day for years  And so to protect themselves people say  I can t      Another related line you often hear is that not everyone can do work they love that someone has to do the unpleasant jobs  Really  How do you make them  In the US the only mechanism for forcing people to do unpleasant jobs is the draft  and that hasn t been invoked for over 30 years  All we can do is encourage people to do unpleasant work  with money and prestige     If there s something people still won t do  it seems as if society just has to make do without  That s what happened with domestic servants  For millennia that was the canonical example of a job  someone had to do   And yet in the mid twentieth century servants practically disappeared in rich countries  and the rich have just had to do without     So while there may be some things someone has to do  there s a good chance anyone saying that about any particular job is mistaken  Most unpleasant jobs would either get automated or go undone if no one were willing to do them     Two Routes    There s another sense of  not everyone can do work they love  that s all too true  however  One has to make a living  and it s hard to get paid for doing work you love  There are two routes to that destination  The organic route  as you become more eminent  gradually to increase the parts of your job that you like at the expense of those you don t     The two job route  to work at things you don t like to get money to work on things you do  The organic route is more common  It happens naturally to anyone who does good work  A young architect has to take whatever work he can get  but if he does well he ll gradually be in a position to pick and choose among projects  The disadvantage of this route is that it s slow and uncertain  Even tenure is not real freedom     The two job route has several variants depending on how long you work for money at a time  At one extreme is the  day job   where you work regular hours at one job to make money  and work on what you love in your spare time  At the other extreme you work at something till you make enough not to have to work for money again     The two job route is less common than the organic route  because it requires a deliberate choice  It s also more dangerous  Life tends to get more expensive as you get older  so it s easy to get sucked into working longer than you expected at the money job  Worse still  anything you work on changes you  If you work too long on tedious stuff  it will rot your brain  And the best paying jobs are most dangerous  because they require your full attention     The advantage of the two job route is that it lets you jump over obstacles  The landscape of possible jobs isn t flat  there are walls of varying heights between different kinds of work    7   The trick of maximizing the parts of your job that you like can get you from architecture to product design  but not  probably  to music  If you make money doing one thing and then work on another  you have more freedom of choice     Which route should you take  That depends on how sure you are of what you want to do  how good you are at taking orders  how much risk you can stand  and the odds that anyone will pay  in your lifetime  for what you want to do  If you re sure of the general area you want to work in and it s something people are likely to pay you for  then you should probably take the organic route  But if you don t know what you want to work on  or don t like to take orders  you may want to take the two job route  if you can stand the risk     Don t decide too soon  Kids who know early what they want to do seem impressive  as if they got the answer to some math question before the other kids  They have an answer  certainly  but odds are it s wrong     A friend of mine who is a quite successful doctor complains constantly about her job  When people applying to medical school ask her for advice  she wants to shake them and yell  Don t do it    But she never does   How did she get into this fix  In high school she already wanted to be a doctor  And she is so ambitious and determined that she overcame every obstacle along the way including  unfortunately  not liking it     Now she has a life chosen for her by a high school kid     When you re young  you re given the impression that you ll get enough information to make each choice before you need to make it  But this is certainly not so with work  When you re deciding what to do  you have to operate on ridiculously incomplete information  Even in college you get little idea what various types of work are like  At best you may have a couple internships  but not all jobs offer internships  and those that do don t teach you much more about the work than being a batboy teaches you about playing baseball     In the design of lives  as in the design of most other things  you get better results if you use flexible media  So unless you re fairly sure what you want to do  your best bet may be to choose a type of work that could turn into either an organic or two job career  That was probably part of the reason I chose computers  You can be a professor  or make a lot of money  or morph it into any number of other kinds of work     It s also wise  early on  to seek jobs that let you do many different things  so you can learn faster what various kinds of work are like  Conversely  the extreme version of the two job route is dangerous because it teaches you so little about what you like  If you work hard at being a bond trader for ten years  thinking that you ll quit and write novels when you have enough money  what happens when you quit and then discover that you don t actually like writing novels     Most people would say  I d take that problem  Give me a million dollars and I ll figure out what to do  But it s harder than it looks  Constraints give your life shape  Remove them and most people have no idea what to do  look at what happens to those who win lotteries or inherit money  Much as everyone thinks they want financial security  the happiest people are not those who have it  but those who like what they do  So a plan that promises freedom at the expense of knowing what to do with it may not be as good as it seems     Whichever route you take  expect a struggle  Finding work you love is very difficult  Most people fail  Even if you succeed  it s rare to be free to work on what you want till your thirties or forties  But if you have the destination in sight you ll be more likely to arrive at it  If you know you can love work  you re in the home stretch  and if you know what work you love  you re practically there                 Notes      1   Currently we do the opposite  when we make kids do boring work  like arithmetic drills  instead of admitting frankly that it s boring  we try to disguise it with superficial decorations       2   One father told me about a related phenomenon  he found himself concealing from his family how much he liked his work  When he wanted to go to work on a saturday  he found it easier to say that it was because he  had to  for some reason  rather than admitting he preferred to work than stay home with them       3   Something similar happens with suburbs  Parents move to suburbs to raise their kids in a safe environment  but suburbs are so dull and artificial that by the time they re fifteen the kids are convinced the whole world is boring       4   I m not saying friends should be the only audience for your work  The more people you can help  the better  But friends should be your compass       5   Donald Hall said young would be poets were mistaken to be so obsessed with being published  But you can imagine what it would do for a 24 year old to get a poem published in The New Yorker  Now to people he meets at parties he s a real poet  Actually he s no better or worse than he was before  but to a clueless audience like that  the approval of an official authority makes all the difference  So it s a harder problem than Hall realizes  The reason the young care so much about prestige is that the people they want to impress are not very discerning       6   This is isomorphic to the principle that you should prevent your beliefs about how things are from being contaminated by how you wish they were  Most people let them mix pretty promiscuously  The continuing popularity of religion is the most visible index of that       7   A more accurate metaphor would be to say that the graph of jobs is not very well connected     Thanks to Trevor Blackwell  Dan Friedman  Sarah Harlin  Jessica

460,training-dataset/business/1225.txt,business,Five Communications Lessons Learned the Hard WayBehind the IPO Spectacle  Five Communications Lessons Learned the Hard Way  Whenever a technology company gears up to go public  I feel a wave of empathy tinged with nostalgia and a little PTSD  Nearly three years ago  Box  my then employer  filed to go public  Ten grueling months later  we finally pulled it off  We dropped our S 1 at the start of a pretty brutal market correction and morphed overnight from a darling of enterprise software to a cautionary tale  The subsequent months were spent clawing our way back to a more nuanced place somewhere in between  It was the hardest and best thing I ve ever been through professionally   Of course  Snap is a very different beast  and its IPO is a very different  and much larger  IPO  To state the obvious  Box is an enterprise software company  Snap aspires to be the modern  camera company   Box is an open and vocal product of the Valley  Snap prefers a more secretive existence in Venice  Perhaps most importantly  Box s CEO has never been photographed by Vogue   Despite these differences  I believe the survival of any high profile IPO ultimately comes down to your story  how well you tell the parts of it you can control  and perhaps more importantly  how well you anticipate and prepare for the parts you can t  Some of the communications lessons we learned the hard way at Box seem to apply to Snap  and I m not the only one who thinks so  hi  danprimack     But first  some disclosures  I am a happy Box shareholder and cheerleader  but no longer an employee  I used to lead communications   And although my whopping Snapchat score of 202 might lead you to assume otherwise  I am not an expert on Snap  nor anything else  teens find exciting   Lesson  1  Understand what story your numbers tell in a vacuum   The S 1 is a major production  It s a chance to perfectly articulate your strategy on the brink of your most profound state change as a company  While the communications team obsesses over the Founder s Letter  your colleagues in finance will drop in the requisite charts  It turns out those charts  if disappointing or surprising in any way  will overshadow everything else in that carefully crafted document   At Box  we of course understood how our financials reflected our long term strategy  I ll spare you the SaaS gospel  But to people who were seeing our accounting for the first time  the numbers did not tell an obvious story  There was no easily projectable path to profitability for people who weren t familiar with our business model  and when the market started to go south for SaaS stocks  we became the poster company for the end of the  growth at all costs  era  Clouded by too much context  I had thought the numbers would be part of our story  not the story  In hindsight  we should have done more education about the mechanics of our business in advance   something that most startups happily ignore in favor of technology and people driven stories  Now two years post IPO  Box has worked to prove it has a healthy and sustainable business model  quarter by quarter  earnings by earnings   The Snap S 1 is a fascinating read  You can see Evan Spiegel s fingerprints all over it  It s a rare glimpse into a truly remarkable company  and one that prides itself on being mysterious  But Snap s metrics dominate the story  including its costs and slowing user growth  Snap surely has a plan  but to the numerically inclined outsider who has never enhanced a selfie with dog ears or rainbow vomit  the path forward might not be obvious  These numbers  and especially where they sit on a spectrum that includes the likes of Twitter and Facebook  will be the prevailing narrative until they change  or Snap does the hard work of helping us understand why that s the wrong spectrum    Lesson  2  Be ready for your momentum to turn against you   Understanding where you are in your narrative arc is one of the hardest things to grasp from inside a company  The year leading up to Box s filing was all momentum  We d raised a boatload of money  back when that was only interpreted as a positive sign  Our CEO was on the cover of Inc as  Entrepreneur of the Year   Dropbox seemed to be struggling with its business offering  Things were good   I remember when longtime Box board member Josh Stein gently warned me that at some point  the positive narrative simply wouldn t be interesting anymore  That we should prepare for some sort of backlash as soon as folks had the ammunition  Smart guy   This guy is smart  too    Now Snap has already had higher highs and lower lows than pre IPO Box  for some strange reason  wildly popular apps for teens get more attention than content sharing platforms for businesses   But its IPO comes at an interesting time  on the heels of its Spectacles induced media frenzy  Surprise hardware launch  Check  Vending machines filled with aforementioned hardware dropped in exotic locations  Check check  Heightened buzz around Snap s threat to Facebook  Check check check   It was a brilliant  attention grabbing  momentum building strategy  And before the buzz subsided  boom  S 1  But all that momentum can turn against you when your numbers aren t quite what some people expected  and your biggest competitor  Facebook  seems to have mastered the art of copying your product mojo  And instead of riding the arc upwards  you hit a curve   To be fair  it s really hard to anticipate this stuff  and impossible to reliably time it  But for the sake of your mental health  just be prepared  okay  I ll spare you the stories of what an emotional wreck I was when our narrative flipped  The only  safe  IPO is probably one at a more under the radar company with pleasantly surprising numbers  think Atlassian or Twilio   But then you wouldn t have much fodder for a Medium post   Lesson  3  Keep telling your story over and over because no one actually knows it   I ll keep this one short  because it s really simple  You ll feel like you ve told your story a million times  You even start to feel bad   people must be sick of hearing it  They probably dream about your enterprise functionality and platform approach and how you re soooo much more than cloud storage   Wait  why is everyone suddenly calling Box a cloud storage provider   Whether you re like Box and you ve been aggressively talking about what you re building for years  or you re the newly minted  Snap  a camera company   there s nothing quite like an IPO to stress test the simplicity and resonance of your messaging with your most diverse and critical audience to date   Lesson  4  Focus on internal communications above all else   During a period of unprecedented external scrutiny  the most important thing you can do is turn your attention inward  In the months ahead of our filing  I met with a handful of comms leaders who had been through recent IPOs  The one piece of advice they all had in common  internal communications is the most critical part of your IPO communications strategy   An IPO is a remarkable achievement  It s the ultimate exit for any startup  You will do your best to downplay it internally  which often centers around a slogan that reminds employees to avoid distraction  At Facebook  that took the form of  Stay Focused and Keep Shipping   At Box  it was  The Best is Yet to Come   which began to seem cruelly accurate as our IPO dragged on and on   But no matter how many all hands you hold or posters you make  an IPO is an exciting  mysterious and highly emotional process for all who have a stake in the outcome  For the vast majority of your employees  it ll be their first IPO  and you should actively guide them through it  If all goes swimmingly  you need to remind them that the hard work of company building doesn t stop with a trip to the NYSE  And if things go sideways  you need to be there to help fill the external validation vacuum with internal resolve   News cycles  even the biggest ones  come and go  but the trust that a company builds with its employees is sacred and needs to endure   Lesson  5  Remember that a tough IPO is amazing practice for being a public company   During an IPO process  you ll have the least amount of control over your story  Your numbers will speak for themselves  and your ability to chime in with additional context will be severely hampered by quiet period restrictions  Early indications of investor sentiment will drive a big part of the narrative  and there s little you can do about it  Get used to it  Being a public company means learning to coexist with a parallel narrative   a daily scorecard  if you will   that you can t control   And here s my self serving theory  the harder the IPO  the filing  the launch  the aftermath   the more emotionally prepared you are for being a public company  Box s hard won NYSE debut was actually quite positive  but by then we were battle scarred and smart enough not to get caught up in it  Which was good  because the public market is never all smooth sailing  The grit and resilience we built during those ten months have been put to good use in Box s new life as a public company  Now that I m no longer a Box employee and can look at the company as an outsider  I m in awe of how much it s transformed in the year I ve been gone  There s a level of maturity and determination that comes from having pushed through the headwinds of doubt to gradually and consistently rebuild your story and rebuild trust   Facebook is perhaps the best recent example of a company that floundered in its debut  powered through a few doubt filled years  and came out much stronger on the other side  If Facebook had pulled off a flawless IPO  would the people there have worked as hard to prove themselves  I think not   Of course  we don t know which way Snap s IPO will go  and to some extent  it doesn t really matter  What matters is how well Snap converts external skepticism into internal resolve  how well it communicates a story that evolves alongside the company  and how well it delivers on the promises it makes   Good luck  Snap,"[460 51 1360 561 987 232 1314 1316 154 288 782]"
478,training-dataset/business/399.txt,business,9 Public Speaking Lessons I ve Learned  So Far  One of the biggest benefits of conference speaking is the motivation to visit new places  Romania had never been in my mind as a place to visit   but being invited to speak there back in March gave me 4 days to explore the city of Bucharest   For me  the first time led to a feeling of acceptance  learning that what I was speaking about engaged the listeners and made sense to them   As long as the title and abstract of your talk are honest  you ll likely have viewers that will be engaged in your talk   If you re nervous about speaking publicly  it s helpful to remember that just like anything  it definitely gets easier after the first time   Maybe even a lot easier  especially if you re going to be giving the same talk the next time around   Berlin has always been on my list to visit but I ve never got around to going  Being offered a slot at Droidcon Berlin gave me even more of a reason to go and take a short break there also   Public speaking has given me more motivation to get out there and visit new places  opening the doors to areas of the world that hadn t been on my radar   3  Getting rejected makes you stronger  My pitches were rejected several times for several different conferences before I begun to receive acceptances  I still get rejections sometimes your talk may not fit in with the rest of the talks  or other people s talks are more relevant than yours at the time   But rejection isn t always bad  Getting rejected made me go back and improve both my talk and my slides  Rejection is sometimes a great motivation for improving on what you do   revisit your efforts and smash it the next time round   You can keep the content of your talk fresh by ensuring you update the slides as the subject you re talking about is updated  For example  as soon as some new Android TV features were added in Android N  I updated my Android TV talk to look at these features   which helped to keep my talk current and offer something new for people to hear about   4  It s about meeting new faces  Whether it s listeners who have questions about your talk or new friends simply just want to say hi  you re bound to meet great new people during a public speaking opportunity   You ll meet people starting out in their career  mid levels a few years in and veterans who are known in the  scene    it s a great way to build your profile and connect with new faces   Conferences in general are a great chance to meet up with friends or make new ones  If you are heading out to a conference  it s a great idea to reach out to others you want to spend time with beforehand   it s easy to get caught up in events and lose track of time   5  You know more than you think  Share it   Everyone has a unique experience when they work on something  We ll experience different failures and different successes   be it in the topic we re speaking about or something closely related   Speaking is a great chance to share this with others and relieve this pain for when they may encounter such an issue  When was the last time you were saved by someone s answer on Stack Overflow      Just like you ll always have something to take away from someone else s talk  there ll always be someone who will take something away from yours  And at the end of the day no matter how many people attend your talk  there will always be someone in the room that can learn something from you  Whether it s something about the topic you re talking about  the company you work for  the presentation slides you ve created or the way in which you re speaking   someone will always walk away with something new   6  Teaching is the best way to learn   The more I ve talked about Android TV to people  the more I understand how it functions  When I began talking about it  my knowledge was quite basic   I hadn t been working with it for too long before giving talks on it   But the more I spoke about it  on top of the more I worked with it  the more confident I became in what I was talking about  Teaching my learnings to others helped me to gain a better understanding of the Android TV framework   Sometimes you ll get those moments when you may have doubted yourself in certain areas of a given topic  For example  someone may ask you how to do x using the library y that you re talking about   you ll think about it and come out with a solution that you had never even thought of before  Moments like these will also help to build your confidence in the topic that you re talking about   7   but there s always more to know  Of courses  there ll also be moments when you realize that you don t actually know as much as you thought you did about a certain area  Speaking isn t like being at your computer  you don t have time to Google the answer or spend a few hours trying to find a solution   When you re speaking  you re put on the spot  This can sometimes be a good way of being  tested  on what you know   This has happened to me several times  and it s fine  If you don t know as much as you thought  it s OK to say so   If anything  it s motivation to go away and improve on the things you don t know so well   8  Speaking builds crucial communication skills  In my field of Android engineering  I need to communicate with either clients  users of our product or other team members  sometimes in a technical discussion   Public speaking helps me get better at conveying a message  The audience of a talk can range from beginners to experts in the field  and I want to make sure everyone gets something out of it   This creates a natural incentive to get better at communicating with a wide range of skill levels  Learning to speak about things at both a higher and lower level is an invaluable skill    You ll also more than likely get feedback on your talk  too  Maybe I spoke too quietly or went through my slides too fast  Both of these situations are opportunities for me to get better  There s always room for improvement  so I try to embrace any feedback I get   9  It s not just talking  it s problem solving  Both during and after your talks  listeners might ask you questions about issues they re having  Whether it s how to do x with the new support library  or how you tackled y using RxJava  there s no doubt that you ll get the chance to problem solve with people  This may be something you ve tackled before  or something you ll get to do on the spot and learn something new from   Because everyone has a different way of thinking  working with new people is such a valuable experience   But it s not always you being the one to help others  Chances are there s something you ve been stuck on   in a gathering of many minds on your topic  it s likely that there s someone watching your talk that knows exactly how to do that thing  Not only will this help you overcome this problem the next time you encounter it  but it gives you something to add to your talk and share with others next time around,"[478 833 1316 505 561 154 295 1145 667 327 986]"
482,training-dataset/business/1251.txt,business,What Running 700 Miles in One Year Taught Me About BusinessAt heart  I m a running purist  No headphones  No waistband for water bottles  No activity monitor or GPS tracker   Just my trusty Asics Trainers and a  10 Casio watch for pace   Seven hundred miles  At seven minutes per mile  that equates to roughly 4 900 minutes  81 6 hours  or 3 4 days   That s a lot of time to think   One of the secrets to running is the ability to lose yourself in positive thought  Brainstorming  reflecting  strategizing  and conjuring up crazy ideas while endorphins are going strong  It s one way to keep the mind from thinking negative  self deflating thoughts   Successful runs happen when the  I m tired  thirsty  hurting  angry  frustrated  not good enough  thoughts are pushed aside for more productive thinking   Which is why   Running is a lot like business   Running rewards those who put the work in day in and day out  It rewards those who know and love the process just as much as the results  and who can block out the negative  learn from mistakes  then keep pushing forward   When I set out on a 10 mile run  my thoughts aren t on the 10th mile  They re on pace  form  technique  and getting stronger with every stride   When the run is over  I m already thinking about the next one  What can I do next time to increase my average mile time  How was my breathing  Could I have hit another hill or pushed myself harder during the challenging parts   The 3 most valuable business lessons I ve learned from running  1  Go Where Others Are Afraid To Go  There are millions of great runners around the world  Each one has their strengths  weaknesses  and unique way of approaching the sport  What separates the good from the great   Great runners are deliberate   They re willing to wake up at 5 00 a m  to train because they have a full time job and a family to take care of  They stretch  eat  and recover with purpose  Everything great runners do is calculated   Same goes for business   Whether they re pursuing a new career path or a new marketing channel  great business people are deliberate about their actions  They ve done the research  thought of all possible scenarios  and considered the consequences of their actions   Deliberate action is a part of their DNA   When business owners decide to take a chance on something that seems crazy to everyone else  they know deep down that they ve had their ears to the streets for months and that it s a good move   2  Overcome Negative Thoughts  One of the biggest business lessons I ve learned from running is just how harmful negativity can be for career growth and business success   Imposter syndrome is one form of negativity that surfaces in all different types of people and situations  If you ve ever experienced this before  you know how hard it can be to overcome   Self doubt and a lack of confidence are closely related to imposter syndrome and can have dramatic consequences on overall well being and business success   To overcome negative thoughts  I use a two step approach   Recognize that they exist and that they are passing thoughts Realize that you are where you are because you deserve it  If you ve put in the hard work  trained  and are successful  it s not because of luck  or because of chance  It s because you ve earned it   By addressing your negative thoughts directly  over time you will develop a sort of internal confidence  Negative thoughts will start to creep in  and you ll kick them right out   3  Achieve Measurable Progress in Reasonable Time  To get to that next level  we all have to push ourselves to be better  To work harder   If you want to be a great runner  at some point you re going to have to train outside of your limits  Turning that 8 mile run into a 10 mile run is what helps you get stronger so that you can achieve new milestones   In the business world  we tend to get stuck in our daily routines  But ultimately  if we want to change the results  we re going to have to step outside of our comfort zones   Reading  taking online classes  asking questions  experimenting  measuring new data  and just flat out doing are the best ways to take control of your outcome   Over to You  We d love to hear from you in the comments   Have you ever drawn similar parallels between sports or activities and business  Do you also run   What other lessons might you add to this list from your own experience   This post was originally published on Medium,"[482 883 1316 51 684 634 362 1145 1390 667 1073]"

492,training-dataset/business/831.txt,business,Know when to ask for help with the 15 Minute RuleA fact of startup life is that no matter what team you work on  you re guaranteed to run into problems you get stuck on   Ask yourself  Am I really the best person to solve this problem   The challenge is deciding how much time to spend on each problem  Should I try to debug a problem until it s solved  or should I ask for help when I m stuck   By using the 15 Minute Rule  everyone on your team learns the value of self sufficiency  but it forces them to reach for the life raft when they really need it   I was taught the simple rule by Jeff  our Director of Customer Support   when I was a junior customer support engineer  If I was stuck on a particular customer problem  he told me to first take 15 minutes to try find the answer before looking for help  If I still didn t have an answer after 15 minutes  I had to ask him for help   The 15 Minute Rule  Take 15 minutes to solve the problem any way you can  However  if you don t have an answer after 15 minutes  you must ask someone   You must try for yourself  It wasn t that Jeff didn t want to help me   he did  But if I kept escalating bugs without even trying to figure it out  I never would have learned how to solve problems for myself   Taking 15 minutes teaches you the skill of not only knowing what to look for  but how to look for it  One of the most valuable skills in any customer support or engineering team is navigating internal codebases  documentation and knowing that  more often than not  the answer is there if you take the time to look for it   Just as importantly  it means that when you do ask for help  you re at least armed with the full context of the problem at hand  You might have tried looking in the codebase  searched old conversations  searched Slack  and searched through the internal documentation and still come up short  But 90  of the time you ll be coming with some valuable threads of information for the person who s helping you out   so you can both solve the problem quicker   But you also must ask for help  But there are situations when you cannot unblock yourself in 15 minutes  or even if you looked all day  In these scenarios  the 15 Minute Rule forces you to ask for help  It s way too easy to disappear down the rabbit hole trying to solve problems  you need to take a step back and ask yourself   Am I really the best person to solve this problem    The fact is   your time is expensive  It might feel good to learn things the hard way   you ll build valuable skills along the way   but there are no prizes for spending 3 hours on a problem someone else could have solved in 10 minutes   How the 15 Minute Rule can help the whole team  For anyone building a customer support team  or engineering team for that matter   the 15 Minute Rule has real benefits   New hires are taught self reliance  But have an all important safety net if they get stuck  New hires can get mentored by senior members and see the logic of how they solve problems  Senior members get to informally review and give feedback on the team s work  Support staff are upskilled while customers don t have to wait too long for answers  Even though I no longer work as an engineer  or even know where most of our documentation lives       the 15 Minute Rule is still something I use regularly  It teaches you to respect your colleagues  time  but not to be afraid to get help when you really need it  So give it a try  and let us know if it works for you in the comments,"[492 327 1054 1316 739 561 565 154 1327 406 789]"
505,training-dataset/business/1023.txt,business,How to Become a Master at Public Speaking  According to The Guy Who Runs TED TalksHow to Become a Master at Public Speaking  According to The Guy Who Runs TED Talks  The Curator of TED Talks shares his secrets to creating a compelling story and influencing groups   Public speaking has been cited as the number one fear of Americans  but whether you re pitching to a VC firm or just talking to a small group of people in the office  it s a pretty big key to success  The point is  we all have to do it   so we might as well try to get good at it  The good news  according to Chris Anderson  the curator at TED Talks  who has been helping people become master presenters for 30 years   is that giving a good talk is coachable  Phew   Here are a few things to keep in mind  according to the TED Talks expert   1  Don t get too technical   As Chris Anderson puts it   You start where they are   One of the most successful talks he has curated involved a complex new biotechnology called Crispr  It would ve gone over almost everyone s head  but instead the speaker likened the tech to a word processor for DNA   If you dive in with technicalities and niche verbiage  you ll probably have the audience drooling in boredom  Instead  think about taking your audience on a journey  know where you will begin  how you will get there  and where you will eventually want to go   2  Make your idea worth sharing   The motto of TED is  Ideas Worth Sharing   and it also applies to any sort of speaking you do   Anderson says the key to any good presentation is the ability to brighten someone s day  Even if you re sweating bullets  if you can think of an actionable way to help out the audience  your speech will make a splash  Try to think of at least three ways to improve the readers  day to start  and let it snowball from there   3  Practice makes better  not perfect   Now that you know what you want to say  you need to figure out how you re going to deliver the talk  Anderson outlines three choices here  read it from a script  bullet point your main ideas  or memorize it from beginning to end  Reading from a script is essentially banned at TED and should be elsewhere  too  that is  if you want an audience who is actually listening  Anderson confirms that the most well received TED talks have been memorized word for word   With enough practice  you will be able to glance at your notes occasionally for needed reminders  but will be able to deliver a talk that is lacking in awkwardness and filled with engagement and flow   4  Stop fidgeting  Your body is saying just as much as your words are   The most common offense that Anderson has seen with TED Talks speakers in the beginning phases of their training is fidgeting and moving their bodies unnecessarily   swaying from side to side  playing with a pen in their hand  shifting their weight from side to side   By taking baby steps to get rid of your fear of public speaking  you too can overcome this  Training yourself to simply stand still and to rely on hand gestures for emphasis can make a world of difference   5  When it comes to multimedia  less is best   With all of the technology available to us today  it seems nearly obligatory to have multimedia to accompany our presentations  Keep this in mind  It s not necessary  In fact  some of the most popular TED Talk speakers did not use media at all  If you take one thing away from this article  please let it be this  Do not use your slides as a substitute for your bullet point notes  and do not repeat out loud what is written on the slide   your audience can read it   6  Be open to feedback   The team at TED Talks starts helping their speakers put their talks together at least six months in advance  Anderson cautions  however   The tricky part about rehearsing a presentation in front of other people is that they will feel obligated to offer feedback and constructive criticism    Feedback can be blistering  but it s the only way to truly improve   even if you re a TED speaker  A starting recommendation  although it may be painful  is to practice with a friend  You will be utterly shocked at how much you have to work on after hearing their thoughts  but better off because of it   7  Give your listeners a reason to care   As Anderson puts it   If the idea only serves you or your organization  then  I m sorry to say  it s probably not worth sharing    Remember  persuading others is a two way street  Whether you re talking to your team or an investor  it can t be all about you  Even if you do have an angle  put yourself in the audience s shoes for a moment  If this isn t something you d want to hear in your free time  it s time to revise   You re an interesting person  and I m sure you have plenty to talk about besides your latest pitch  Don t worry about making the hard sell   if you offer something of value  it will come naturally   Do you have any public speaking tips  I want to hear them   give me a shout out on Twitter or leave a comment below   If you liked this piece  be sure to follow me on Medium and check out my column in Inc  Magazine,"[505 833 478 522 1316

 More than a year later and sans those initial episodes  the podcast is here   Yes  those first episodes didn t make the cut and neither did several other attempts that followed  The Buffer marketing podcast was a long wished for project that simply needed the right timing  people  talent  ideas  knowledge  If you ve ever wanted to start a podcast   if you ve ever wished to do anything ambitious or new   you might ve found similar serendipity blocks  I m happy to encourage that you can do it  and I m happy to share how we did   Read below to learn how The Science of Social Media  our new podcast  finally came together  and get more info on how September unfolded for us on the marketing team  I m excited to share everything  Hope you enjoy  Feel free to AMA  ask me anything  in the comments   We launched a podcast   After 23 important steps   Podcasting might be one of the most powerful channels for building brand authority  At least  that s what we re hoping to test out   It took us over a year since we started our podcast explorations to finally come through and ship the podcast  There were likely a number of reasons why  including this one   The ROI of a podcast is murkier than most every other piece of content   You can track a blog reader s journey through your marketing funnel  You can put UTMs on your email links   But a podcast   Guesses and wishes   We truly believe that podcasting works as a significant medium for boosting your brand  We just didn t know how to prioritize it  In the absence of data  we defaulted to the marketing efforts that we could do most efficiently with the small team that we had  and those efforts meant blogging  PR  social  and community   Then a few things happened   Courtney launched a culture podcast  which proved to be awesome inspiration and a wonderful resource to learn from  Our team got bigger  In the past 12 months  we ve added Ash  Hailley  and Brian  plus we merged with the community team and brought in a data analyst  David  and an engineer  Steve   Podcasting really took off as a marketing channel   I like to think that timing isn t a determining factor in the projects we choose for marketing  Though in this case  it sure seemed that providence was waiting for these pieces to come together before a podcast could work   In having Courtney take the first steps with the CultureLab podcast  we were able to remove the element of the Big Unknown from our podcasting efforts  She had done it  It was possible   Moreso  we had an incredible resource to lean on who could tell us exactly what it was like to launch a podcast from scratch   In terms of the actual people we needed to pull this off  in the past we found that the level of attention and care needed to do a podcast in the way we envisioned was a bit beyond our means  there were just the two of us  me and Courtney  working on marketing at the time   Enter Brian and Hailley  who graciously offered their time and energy to interview guests  edit the audio  research and brainstorm on all things podcasts  and create a really amazing podcast experience   And the final bit of impetus  Podcasting continued to grow  We couldn t really ignore it any longer as a channel to experiment with   All these factors helped us get over the hump with podcasting and to actually ship the show  You can have a listen to all the episodes so far  feedback has been very kind and affirming  We re nearing 35 000 total listens through the first three weeks   The 23 things we did to launch  In terms of what specifically it took to launch a podcast  here s a quick rundown of everything we thought about before launching   Choose a subject  social media  Come up with an original idea  telling the stories of individual marketers doing great things on social media  Choose a format  interviews  Choose a length  30 minutes or less  Choose a name  The Science of Social Media   this took a reallllllly long time to settle on  Find or create intro music  we created it  Detail out the particulars of the format  example here  Figure out what software and tools you need  for us  Skype  Skype Recorder  Adobe Audition  Libsyn  Soundcloud  Order equipment  for us  Yeti microphones and pop filters  Reach out to guests Coordinate recording times Interview guests Build a podcast landing page Make the podcast logo artwork Record the intro outro Mix  balance  and edit the final audio Write the show notes Transcribe the audio  we haven t done this just yet  but we would ve gone with Rev if we had  Upload to Libsyn Submit to iTunes  Once we had all this in place  then we could launch   And once we had the launch completed  then there was promotion  Almost forgot  It ended up that the promotion element was  and still is  an area with almost as much to do as getting the podcast launched in the first place  Here s an article with all the research we did and the strategies we re trying   I d love to hear what your experience is with starting a podcast   or thinking of starting one  Let me know any questions you have or any advice feedback you d be open to sharing  It d be great to empathize together   September s highlights from Buffer marketing  1  Week of webinars   here s how to do it super lean  One of our Q3 OKRs was to get a lot of people onto a Buffer webinar   And three quarters of the way through the quarter  I had really dropped the ball  We had hosted zero marketing webinars   In the back of my mind  I had been holding onto the idea of running a series of webinars one after the other in a really short timeframe  I thought that we could whip something like that up quite quickly  which was probably why I had procrastinated so long  Soon enough  the time came to follow through on that hopeful prediction   In the span of 10 days  here s how we went from zero marketing webinars to five marketing webinars and a reach of 6 395 people   Day 1   Late on Wednesday  we found out that a marketing email to all our Buffer customers  a list of 1 5 million  was looking iffy  The intended topic  a product launch  was unlikely to happen   Thinking quickly  Hailley and I jumped into the draft to quickly put together an email about webinars  Here re the steps we took   Wrote the email copy  leaving a placeholder to describe the topics for all five webinars  Reached out to the happiness team to share the content of the email  Hopped into Slack to check with the team about who wanted to run a webinar next week and on what topic  Filled in the email with the new topics  Jumped into MailChimp and created a new email list  On the General Forms tab  we added an extra field to the signup form for people to select which webinars they wished to attend   This MailChimp form became the landing page for our webinars  We added this page to the email and linked to it in all of our webinar promotion materials   Day 2   We sent the email   The response was really great  and the MailChimp form worked smoothly with no hiccups  The nicest part was that all the details for the webinar registration was handled automatically in MailChimp  I customized the wording of some of the follow up emails  but mostly I stayed hands off and let MailChimp do its thing   With this part of the plan complete  I turned my attention to finding a webinar software program to use  There are a lot of great ones to consider like GoToMeeting  Zoom  and others  For us  it was important that  The software was cheap or free  The software was easy to setup and learn   We had three days to all feel fully comfortable with whatever we chose   You could do screen sharing  The software could handle thousands of viewers at once  Soon after sending the email  we were already seeing hundreds of signups  The webinar itself is easy for people to attend and rewatch  We ended up going with YouTube Live  which was great for all the reasons we wanted   It was free The software is built on Google Hangouts  which we were quite familiar with We could do screen sharing The video is live on YouTube  for as many people as you want The video is live on YouTube  accessible before  during  and after from a single link  Day 3   I went in and set up all the webinars for the coming week by creating new events from the YouTube Creator Studio  All the live sessions are available in Creator Studio by clicking on Live Streaming   Events from the left hand menu   In terms of setup  all I needed to do here was to give the event a name  description  and tags  then be sure that the Type was set to  Quick  using Google Hangouts on Air     After setting up the videos  I returned to MailChimp to email out the links to the webinar sessions as well as calendar invites for everyone  We went with a pretty simple format

518,training-dataset/product/577.txt,product,Ways We WorkWith regards to team management  are the challenges similar to what you faced when you ran Teehan Lax versus what you re facing now at Facebook   I think it s different  What came in the top of the funnel at Teehan Lax  at least in terms of the talent  were usually from the same walk of life  They came from similar companies to Teehan Lax  There wasn t and still isn t the type of atmosphere in Toronto that there is down here in the Bay Area  You get wildly different types of designers here and that is a big difference  The designers that would come to Teehan Lax typically had been working at other ad or design agencies previously  As different as I like to think that Teehan Lax was  to a certain extent  our working style was not unfamiliar to people who were coming in the door there   Earlier on in your career  what was the turning point where you knew you wanted to start an agency rather than go work for another company   It happened twice actually  When I first started  I was working for an Internet company that was doing web hosting  domain purchasing and web design  Web design was the fad  It was the mid  90s so it was the super early days  What happened was I worked there for a while and then the company went bankrupt  There were great people working there and I found myself without a job  I decided to take a stab at doing my own thing  which I did  That was in the late 90 s  I did that for about two years and then one of our clients  a big digital agency called Modem Media  came along and I ended up taking a job with them  I enjoyed that  Making money again was nice  working on larger clients  and not having to worry about some of the things you worry about when you own your own business  Focusing on the work as a young designer was a refreshing change and something I think I needed   That was great  but then it happened again  the dot com bubble burst and I didn t have a job anymore  I had been working with Jon  Lax  at Modem Media and we decided to start our thing  We found ourselves in a similar place where we looked around and didn t see anything that interested us job wise  so we started our own company instead  We just fell into it  We figured we d do it for six months or a year or however long the initial contracts we had would last and then we d go get what we call  real jobs   It wasn t until we signed leases for photocopiers with 3 year commitments that we realized we were in it for the long haul  It was one of the those silly things  Obviously we were subletting a space and we had bought equipment and we even had one staff member too  so it wasn t like we weren t committed  Even still  it felt like we could get out without too much damage  It wasn t until we rented this Xerox copier that made it feel like something long term  The lease was on a 3 year term and we had to sign it  It was like  10 000 or  12 000  it wasn t an insane amount of money  but back then it was this real commitment because getting out of that lease would be a big pain in the ass  This is one of the small things  Obviously  hiring employees was a big deal as well,"[518 609 1145 51 313 1062 1316 456 1390 154 1025]"
522,training-dataset/business/834.txt,business,The Question that Improves Every Pitch   Firm Narrative   MediumThe Question that Improves Every Pitch  A simple way to get business audiences on your side   When a pitch goes badly   sales pitch  investor pitch  plea for company resources  whatever   there s usually a specific moment when it falls apart   Before that moment  your audience gives you the benefit of the doubt  After that moment  they re tuned out  You can almost feel them turn against you   I ve noticed that 9 times out of 10  when things go south  it happens at a single  identifiable point in the story   The moment when you introduce the thing you re pitching   Why Does This Happen   Let s take for granted that the thing you re pitching   your solution   is super compelling  We ll assume also you ve laid the groundwork in your pitch by describing a big problem that it addresses    I prefer the  Promised Land obstacles gifts  framework vs  the more common problem solution one  but what I ll discuss here applies to both    When most people pitch  they introduce their solution as an assertion  It usually sounds like this   So to solve that problem  we re building X  which does   Introducing your solution this way seems obvious and straightforward  And certainly  most pitch advice tells you to do it   However  I regularly see negative audience reactions immediately after the solution is presented this way  Here s why   You become less likable  Stating categorically that you ve got the solution to a big problem   especially if you re just starting out   can make you appear arrogant and or naive  Even if you re correct  your audience will be skeptical  You invite attacks  An assertion prods your audience to ask   Is he she right   In other words  the assertion invites people to hunt for reasons you re wrong  And if there s one thing skeptical audiences  read  VCs and potential customers  love to do  it s find ways that you re wrong and  by implication  they re right  Your credibility on everything that follows takes a hit  You ll need to offer evidence that your solution is promising  traction  market size  etc    But because you ve already introduced your solution as correct   even implicitly  everything you say from that point forward is contaminated by bias  Your audience will be thinking   He she is pushing this solution  so of course he she s going to handpick data that supports his her case    A Better Approach  Your Solution as a Question  Anytime I m pondering how to get an audience engaged  I go back to basics  For me  that means consulting the storytelling wisdom of the world s modern god of audience engagement  This American Life creator Ira Glass   According to Glass  and other narrative theorists   the secret to audience engagement is building dramatic tension  How do you do that  By asking and answering questions   The whole shape of the story is that you re throwing out questions to keep people watching and listening  and then answering them along the way    IRA GLASS  So how can we introduce our solutions as questions  I went looking for speakers who do this  and found some illustrative examples   AirBnB founders Nathan Blecharczyk  Joe Gebbia and Brian Chesky  Here s AirBnB co founder Brian Chesky recalling his now famous founding story  in which he and co founder Joe Gebbia offered up air mattresses to traveling designers   We had this idea that the designers coming to attend the conference needed a place to stay   we had no money   so what if we created a bed and breakfast for the design conference    AIRBNB CO FOUNDER BRIAN CHESKY  Chesky s not pitching  of course  but you can imagine how  back when he was  framing AirBnB as a question would have drawn audiences in   Uber CEO Travis Kalanick  Next  check out Travis Kalanick pitching Uber s car pool service  uberPOOL  in his recent TED talk   And so we started thinking about  well  how do we make those two trips and turn them into one  Because if we did  that ride would be a lot cheaper   up to 50 percent cheaper   and of course for the city you ve got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars    And so the big question for us was  would it work  Could you have a cheaper ride cheap enough that people would be willing to share it    UBER CEO TRAVIS KALANICK  And here s social psychologist Amy Cuddy  in the second most popular Ted talk of all time   Your body language shapes who you are   introducing the idea that posture can affect your mental state and how you interact with others   Harvard Business School Associate Professor Amy Cuddy    C an power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways    AMY CUDDY  How to Frame Your Solution As a Question  As you can see  the general form these questions is    So we thought  what if we built tried X    So I thought   yes  dogfooding it   what if I tried this with leadership teams that are my clients   We immediately saw   in investor pitches  sales conversations  change leadership speeches  whatever   the opposite of what used to happen   You become more likable  People are more willing to go on the journey with you when you project curiosity instead of certainty   You invite collaboration  Now  when audience members voice their own ideas about how you might proceed  the conversation feels more like they re collaborating with you on an experiment  rather than attacking you  The feeling of collaboration seems shared by speaker and audiences alike   You build engagement and credibility  Because you ve positioned your solution as a question  your audience starts thinking   How will it turn out    That s what Ira Glass meant by dramatic tension   Everything that follows is more engaging and believable because you haven t attached yourself to an outcome   If you try this  let me know how it goes   Based on promising results  I m considering making this   introducing the solution as a question   a part of all the strategic messaging that I build  Still  I d be fascinated to hear from others who try it  How did it go,"[522 598 868 561 1314 1349 289 925 798 154 505]"

529,training-dataset/product/549.txt,product,Talking trends in product with Intercom s Paul Adams and Emmet ConnollyAs we turn the page to 2017  we ve been thinking a lot about the buzzwords and trends of the past year  Things like chatbots  voice UI  conversational commerce  machine learning  moving from screens to systems   all were discussed and debated anywhere and everywhere  including our own blog  We at Intercom also had a handful of massive launches in 2016  including Smart Campaigns  a new Messenger and Educate  our knowledge base product  and that has us reflecting on a year s worth of lessons learned  To make sense of the past year and dig into where product and design are headed next  I hosted a roundtable discussion with Paul Adams  our VP of Product  and Emmet Connolly  our Director of Product Design  If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the interview  but if you re short on time  here are five key takeaways  Given today s technology  chatbots are best left to handling computation  Things that require empathy or emotion  on the other hand  are still better handled by a human  From Airbnb s launch of Trips to Instagram s addition of Stories  products built as systems rather than a set of screens became more prevalent in the past year  As new uses are demanded for your product  your system will have to expand  Breakthrough products target existing behaviors  rather than asking users to break from the norm  2016 featured two prime examples of the former  Snapchat Spectacles and Tesla s solar tiles  Product teams must make a philosophical shift after they launch a product  As the team enters iteration  every previous decision is back on the table  Defining conversational commerce as sending texts to a bot is simply too narrow  Product builders must expand that view and look at their product as an ecosystem with many endpoints   and messaging is just one of them  Des Traynor  Today I m lucky to be joined by Paul Adams  our VP of Product  and Emmet Connolly  our Director of Product Design  2016 was marked in a lot of ways by bots  We had our own opinions  and we had our own experiments  as did the entire industry  Is the future of product design really gonna sit inside a chat bubble  Paul Adams  Both Emmet and I wrote a lot of blog posts about bots over the year  and we built a lot of bots too  Some of them saw the light of day  some didn t  We learned that bots are overhyped  For very human things like empathy and emotion  bots are terrible  What we didn t realize is that bots do work for a very specific set of use cases that are probably narrower than people first imagined  There was a crazy AI vision of the future  where bots are as intelligent as humans  and our biggest realization was that bots are good at some things  and humans are good at other things  Bots are really good at computation  Bots are basically simple computers  so if you need to ask somebody what your next bill was gonna be  a bot can calculate that far faster than a human  who d have to look up the system  find your account  look at the UI and find the number  For very human things like empathy  emotion and reading between the lines of what someone s actually trying to say  bots are terrible at that  given today s technology  Des  Emmet  from a design perspective  it sounds like you d have to spend half your time dealing with whether or not the bot knows the answer  In the majority of cases the bot s probably not going do a good job  right  Emmet Connolly  We have a system whereby a human or a bot could answer your question  and so it becomes more of a rooting problem than a problem of   What do I do in this failure case where the bot doesn t know the answer   If the bot doesn t know an answer  or can t provide a great one  then the human should provide the answer   Paul and Emmet s teams designed Educate  Intercom s new knowledge base product  for bots to supplement a human customer support where appropriate  A lot of the pitfalls we saw this year were use cases where people building these bots were over promising what they could deliver  The technology for an English language level conversation really isn t there yet  and that has plunged us into this trough of disillusionment  That s also a good place to be  because it means that we re getting real about what s actually possible  If 2016 was the year of hype around this  we could actually see a lot of real life  useful tools and products emerge in the next year  Des  It s really convenient  the way these things pick whole years in which they re going to experience these iterations  We see bots that pretend to be humans  like   Hi  I m Barry the airline bot  how can I book you a flight   And then you see bots that are blatantly bots  like   I m the little operator bot  and I m going to point you in the right direction   You said the idea of trying to humanize these bots isn t something that we want to do at Intercom  but what s the general thinking there  The degree to which you personify the bot evokes a very different reaction in the end user  Emmet  Our thinking has actually evolved a lot as we ve tried out a lot of the experiments that Paul mentioned  Initially the thing that seemed most obvious to me was   Hey  these are friendly little robots that can interact in your conversation  Let s make them be tiny Pixar characters   That s not what resonated with the users that we put our early bot iterations in front of  The nuance of tweaking a little bit of the language or the degree to which you personify the bot evokes a very different reaction in the end user  Some of our early experiments had people saying   Hey  I m  bot name   I m not a real person  but I have a character   People didn t like that at all  because hey felt slightly duped by it  They thought they were here to talk to a person  If you can insert a level of automation and   Hey  I am an automated bot that s here to speed up the process   then people can see the value in that  and it doesn t feel like a bit of a bait and switch  Des  We had a command line once upon a time   Write in the exact word and you ll get the exact answer   Do you think people s behavior changes when they know they re talking to a bot  Do they still continue the formalities and the civility and the   Hey  I m curious about    or is it just like   Flights please   Paul  For me  this thing is a scale  At one end of the scale is a command line interface  where it s clear that you re talking to a computer  People don t actually  in many cases  turn around and ask themselves   What is a bot   There s no actual common definition  We  in one of our blog posts  said that a bot is a simple computer program that executes  and then to Emmet s point  you can give it a face  you can give it a name  and you can make it more or less human like  If the command line interface is one end of the scale  at the opposite end is what Facebook was trying to do  whereby you didn t know if you re talking to a person or a bot  and clearly there somewhere is the uncanny valley  We didn t get close to the uncanny valley  We were far down the path of this is clearly a computer program  The minute it started pretending it was anything other than a computer  people reacted very negatively to it   Bots are most effective today when users know exactly what they re interacting with  Des  So it comes down to honesty and transparency  Emmet  Partially  I also think part of the 2016 exuberance from bots was around this sense of   Check out this very simple use case that I made up  screen shot  and put in my blog post   and people with a sense for product said   Wow  that does seem like a real new simple way of doing things   Then when you try and actually build these things  you realize that typing human  English language sentences to a robot isn t how you want to interact with a robot  If you give people a blank input field  it leaves a lot of room for the person to be rude to the robot or type pseudo commands or friendly questions to them  There s an evolution of the input on the end user s side that isn t quite so English language based  Maybe some of that standardizes around how you might be given a set of pre canned responses that you can send to the bot  which is faster than typing a whole sentence  It s easier because you actually know what you can say to the bot  which is another problem these blank input fields provide  If I m right about that  it s possible that that question of   What should your tone be when interacting with a bot   would go away  Des  If you follow that thread all the way  it s hard to see how that doesn t start to look like buttons that you click  It starts to look like UI  Emmet  The most salient characteristic of conversational UI is not necessarily that you re typing raw text in at the bottom of the screen  it s that you have this back and forth log of commands  It goes back and forth  and there s more ways of sending a command to the computer than typing it into the input field at the bottom  Des  And maybe there s not a predetermined order the command should be received in  and they would be in a form or something similar  Paul  Right  and to play at both sides there  there s also more ways than having this nice grid layout on a screen  with a left hand nav and a button at the bottom  and all the other common ways in which we ve come to expect products to work  The rise of systems Des  Paul  you spoke a lot this year about the idea that products should be thought of as systems rather than just a set of screens  How has that played out a lot in 2016  Have you seen a lot of new systems emerge  Paul  Most people building software are actually building and designing systems already   they just may not necessarily realize it  Systems are these broad networks of things that are related and connected  Uber is a simple example  Uber is certainly not a software company and certainly not an app company  Uber is this ecosystem of drivers  passengers  inventory  all sorts of things  Over time as that system emerged and evolved  Uber added things like surge pricing  Other parts of the system like price and availability and even where people drive   the whole thing changes  You change one piece of the system  and other the pieces of the system change  One example from this year that I use is Nike   Their app was totally redesigned this year  It used to be called Nike  Running  The redesign is now called Nike  Run Club  That s a sort of branding distinction  It s like   Oh  it s a club  There s other people  Oh  it s a system  All right  There are connected things happening in here   If you go into the Nike  Run Club app now  you can go on runs  track your mileage  all the normal stuff that running apps have  But they ve paid a lot more attention to the system of runners   runs with other people  meetups in different cities  your running shoes  Nike  had a lot of these components but they ve certainly doubled down on an idea that this is actually a broad ecosystem far beyond the app  The app is a conduit to other things happening in real life   Des  What about from the design perspective  Emmet  Have you seen any new things emerge in this regard  Emmet  Airbnb went through a similar transformation this year  The objects or actors in that system used to be things like guests and hosts and housing accommodation  Now they ve added Trips  very much broadening their scope  One would assume they ve had to evolve their underlying system to cater for these new things that they ve added  That suggests to me that the system will tend to expand as new uses are demanded  If you looked at the Instagram app earlier this year  the big button in the bottom middle would open your camera and you would post that to your stream  Now they ve added Stories and almost flipped what they re about  Now the button at the bottom is to upload a photo you ve taken before  That s your curated feed  Honestly  it s probably what Instagram was always about  Snapchat is the possibly unfair  hard to avoid comparison when you look at how Instagram has evolved their system  Snapchat in itself is an interesting example  because they came from a very chaotic place earlier in the year and they seem to be rationalizing a lot of concepts  You could say that Instagram and Snapchat are meeting in the middle having come from very opposite places  Targeting existing behaviors Des  Instagram started with a very clean system  It was very obvious you had your own stream and other people s streams  and that was it  Snapchat started from  frankly  who knows where  It was the most aggressive disrespect of systemic standards of software  I heard it argued a while ago that Snapchat s an unconventional UI was actually part of it s genius   it made the product somewhat viral because everyone had to teach each other how to use Snapchat  Snapchat themselves have had a interesting year  Aside from blowing up  they also released hardware for the first time  They took a really different approach from the likes of Apple  who are trying to get people to either replace or start wearing a watch  or Google Glass  who are trying to get people who don t wear glasses to wear glasses  Google actually had nothing to offer people who did wear glasses  which left them in a difficult situation  Snapchat said   Screw all that  Let s just sell some sunglasses   To me  that approach lines up  because they re targeting an existing behavior  sunglasses  with a better product  That is usually how good products happen  How do you see it  Paul  My take is pretty simple  These products are attempts at major breakthroughs for how people live and act  and the ones that are successful don t necessarily try to change people s behavior  They understand how people behave  act and think  and the new thing that emerges is congruent with that  This idea of building bridges to the future was very prevalent when I was at Google  Things like Google Glass and Google Wave  these were products that didn t really build bridges to the future  They were so different and forced people to act in totally new ways  People just didn t know what to do with them  Whereas Snapchat s glasses are sunglasses and that s it  They re sunglasses with a camera  and people wear sunglasses  If you actually watch the launch video for Snapchat s glasses  above   it s not people flying around on skateboards  It s literally a shot of normal life except they ve different sunglasses on  Google Glass s video had all this augmented reality  It was like a science fiction movie  It s obvious to me that the winners are the ones who don t try to radically alter society from the get go  Des  The bridge is the right concept for that  Snapchat could roll out a next version with a screen inside the lens that lets you see filters applied  but obviously they have to get there  Paul  Look at the development of the horse to the car  The very first things that emerged were basically horseless carriages  You can actually see a step by step progression  The winners are the ones who don t try to radically alter society from the get go  Fast forward to today and look at Tesla  The Tesla car doesn t need to look like a car  It doesn t have to have an engine at the front  The chassis is the mechanics of the car  but it still has something that looks like an engine and something that looks like a trunk  That s because people need this bridge  They re not going to buy a Tesla if it looks radically different to a car  Emmet  I wonder if this bridge to the future concept is especially true for consumer products  where no one wants to seem like a weirdo on a pseudo futuristic thing  The car is an interesting example  If you think about a thing that s likely to somehow achieve mass adoption at some stage over the next  x  years  it s self driving cars  There will be a gradual acceptance of the general public to self driving cars and your willingness to take your hands literally off the wheel and trust the computer  because that s a consumer use case  If you think about self driving trucks  fundamentally the same product  I would anticipate there will be an almost overnight switch as soon as it becomes possible from a regulation point of view  mostly from a bottom line finances  Some CFO of a massive company is going to make the switch overnight to self driving trucks  and likely the entire industry will follow within a very short amount of time  Shifting from product launch to iteration Des  You both spent a lot of the year working on our new Educate product  which is Intercom s take on a knowledge base  The product s launched  and we re in a different mode  What happens after launch for a team  Paul  It s been fascinating because the mode the team needs to work on almost the minute after the product launches is different to the one that they had before launch  This happens overnight  In the lead up to launch  design decisions are antagonized over for a long period of time  but they re at some point locked down  It was like   Do not open this conversation again  Do not increase the scope of this thing  Narrow  narrow  narrow  narrow  Get down to the hit list  Knock it off  Knock it off  Knock it off  No opening up of old things    The minute we launched  suddenly  that all goes away and everything s on the table again  It s the nature of all software that when you launch something  you ve got loads of stuff wrong  Loads  Even if you ve run a great beta  Suddenly  every single decision you made is up for debate again  It s very hard to suddenly accept that we might change it all and do it all a different way and iterate  A sign of a great product team is not what they ship in their version 1 0  It s version 1 1  Emmet  There s almost a tendency to become more conservative  You re thinking   We got it working  We finally got past the finish line   and now some people are using it and liking it  You have to be extremely brave at that point and say   There s a huge amount of input and information that we didn t have before   A sign of a great product team is not necessarily what they ship in their version 1 0  It s that version 1 1  That s when you really see how great a product team operates and thinks  how agile can they be in adapting to the new world where the rubber hits the road and their product is out there and they re getting feedback  Paul  Instagram impressed me in its early years because of it s simplicity  I was at Facebook when Instagram was acquired and the Instagram team was incredibly disciplined  There was pressure from all over the industry to add this or that  especially the minute Facebook acquired Instagram   Why doesn t Instagram have this feature if Facebook does and Facebook knows it works  They should just add it   The team was incredibly disciplined to keep Instagram really simple  A lot of Instagram s success in the early years was because it was so accessible and simple to understand  and they stuck to this core use case  Credit to them as Snapchat has moved the industry on  They ve been able to adapt and that is the sign of a great team  a team that can change  Des  They both represent proof that you do not need a large product footprint to have insane engagement  They re both relatively small product footprints  They have managed to get stronger  better  more engaging and more addictive without actually adding 15 more screens or 25 more workflows  which is stock B2B SaaS philosophy  What s to come in 2017 Des  We re going to do a lightning round  so short answers here  Voice as a user interface  will it be relevant in 2017  Paul  Absolutely  Huge  Emmet  No doubt  Des  Relevant in B2B as well  Emmet  Too early to say  Des  Conversational commerce   overhyped  absolute bullshit  very meaningful  Paul  Not overhyped  definitely a big deal  and probably has a bad name  Des  Conversational commerce is way too broad  Emmet  It still holds great promise for very specific use cases  but if you expect that all of commerce will move into your messenger you re probably sorely mistaken  Des  Virtual reality   will it be relevant in B2B and B2C in 2017 Emmet  Too early  I s time has come for gaming and that ll be exciting to see what the possibilities are  It doesn t feel like all the pieces are there yet  Des  Worst trend in product design today  Emmet  The silver bullet mentality  whether it s conversational commerce today  bots throughout this year or shiny buttons fifteen years ago  There s always something and you ve got to consider whether it s a trend or an actual new building block  Paul  AI  No one actually can define agreeably what AI even is  When most people say AI they mean if  then  this  that statements  Just take some humble pie and agree that we re not there yet  Des  What was your favorite new product of 2016 and why  Emmet  I have a very un sexy answer for this   the Belkin WeMo light switch  which has removed this very small but noticeable friction from my every night of shutting off all of the lamps around the room  At Google there used to be this concept of  does a product pass the toothbrush test  Would you use it at least a couple of times a day  This removes a very tiny thing but if you can make a tiny improvement a couple of times a day in every day of your life  that s decent  I will say that from a product point of view it s still a total mess  There s actually no system behind how home automation works to really tie it together so you have to Sellotape all the bits together  Paul  One of the most ingenious  amazing inventions of the past year was Tesla s roof tiles  Don t put these big panels on your house  just make tiles that do that instead  It harks back to the idea of building a bridge to the future   Would you rather  put this foreign looking sci fi object on your roof  or just swap out your tiles,"[529 680 610 561 154

532,training-dataset/product/911.txt,product,The typography of  Stranger Things Like most of us at Nelson Cash  you ve probably heard about Netflix s latest cult show Stranger Things from your best friend or work buddy  And if you re like me  you innocently pushed play on a work night and by midnight realized the scene in your living room was looking a lot like that one Portlandia skit   Yes  the show is really that good  But what got me  Besides brilliant character development  a killer score  and all those warm and fuzzy nods to my youth   These 52 seconds   As a person who spends her days trying to effectively communicate with people through design  I recognized another star on the screen  that typography  tho     The Stranger Things title sequence is pure  unadulterated typographic porn  With television shows opting for more elaborate title sequences  think GOT and True Detective   the opening of Stranger Things is refreshingly simple  It trims the fat and shows only what is necessary to set the mood  More importantly  it proves a lesson I ve learned time and time again as a designer  You can do a lot with type   But how do a few pans of a logo accomplish so much in such a short amount of time  I break down its typographic success to 3 powerful plays  recognition  scale  and palette   1  Recognition  The Stranger Things logo probably looks strangely familiar  taking you back to an era when Stephen King reigned supreme  The show s creators  Matt and Ross Duffer  directly cite King as the inspiration behind the show s logo  having sent copies of King s novels to Imaginary Forces  the creative studio behind the title sequence   Immediately recognizable to anyone that lived through the 80s  those covers bring chills to your spine  Using a modified version of the distinctive typeface Benguiat  the Stranger Things logo respectfully and effectively plays on that recognition in the title sequence  setting the mood for what is to follow   2  Scale  Glowing red lines enter the frame  One might think they re simple shapes at first  but soon you realize it s a close up of the joint of N  the arc of R  the spine of S  They re so close you can make out individual specks of film grain  Gets your heart going a bit  amiright   An extreme close up is a cinematic technique that when used sparingly and with intent can invoke intense emotion from the viewer  By getting up close and personal  the viewer reaches a new level of intimacy with the scene  This intimacy causes the viewer to become vulnerable  and vulnerability elicits a deeper emotion in this case  unease or even fear   3  Palette  Finding the right combination of typefaces can be tiresome  Although there are no rules  there are some techniques designers use to guide us through the process  Using some of these techniques  the pairing of decorative serif Benguiat and geometric sans serif Avant Garde builds a typographic palette that effectively sets the tone for the show   What particularly interests me about the 2 typefaces is their historical alliance  Each was designed by typographic heroes and old pals  Ed Benguiat  Benguiat  and Herb Lubalin  Avant Garde   Each was released by ITC in the 1970s  And each was inspired by distinct art movements of the early twentieth century Benguiat by Art Nouveau and Avant Garde by Bauhaus   The 1980s revived retro typography from various art periods in a way that brought new meaning to their use  By using them again in 2016  as the Stranger Things team did so brilliantly  we are reminded of the historical power of typography  the transcendental property of design  and the nostalgia that lives forever in our hearts   Note  I have since binge watched the rest of the season  Bravo to the geniuses involved in the production of the show  with a special callout to the insanely talented team at Imaginary Forces  Credit for images used throughout this article goes to designer and animator Eric Demeusy   This post was originally published on Medium,"[532 1169 782 632 609 154 1316 1189 649 982 610]"

537,training-dataset/product/191.txt,product,Taking Your Product Across Cultures by Lisa Long47 Flares 47 Flares    The commercial world is littered with the wreckage of international expansion plans gone awry  whether it s the  2 billion that US discount retailer Target misguidedly spent thinking Americans and Canadians are the same  Tesco s failure to understand US shopping habits with its Fresh   Easy brand or the failure of the HP digital magazine Pivot to accommodate French and German editions in a layout that was grounded in English  Telenor s VP of Product Lisa Long gave the London  mtpcon audience a valuable crash course in how to minimize these sorts of missteps when you try to take your product beyond its initial home audience   Here be dragons  She started with the story of an invitation to brunch in Norway   who knew that whilst in the UK it s more than acceptable to appear with a bottle of champagne  in Norway you re expected to bring bread and bringing a bottle of champagne leads your hosts to ask if you have a drinking problem  Says Long   Such are the vagaries of culture  Culture tells you everything you re supposed to do  from the products you make to the things you re supposed to bring to brunch  Here be dragons  and the bad news is we don t even agree what dragons are    But once you re established in one culture  how do you know what questions to ask to take your product to the next one  It s hard  says Long  and even those with deep pockets get it wrong   Do your research  As a starting point  ask what problem your product solves  says Long  She uses dating apps to illustrate the point  in the UK dating apps are used to meet new people  whereas in Norway they are used to vet your existing network  And in Iceland   population 300 000   the first information that comes from any dating app is how closely you re related to another person  Dating apps may help you to meet new people  but in each of these cases they solve a very different problem   You need to understand the basic assumptions about your product in your home market so that you know what must be changed to make it work in a new environment  Product managers need to understand fundamental social conventions in the country they want to launch in  and that means learning about the country and talking to users  Long suggests that information sources like the CIA World Fact Book  Statista  your chosen country s embassy  the UK Department of International Trade are all good places to start    Once you know what the country looks like  you can bring the country to you   she says   If you know what the three best selling mobiles are in the country you re targeting then use them for a week   Facebook for example has 2G Tuesdays where the staff has to use phones from emerging markets in simulated slow network speeds  so that  everyone can feel what it s like to be in a developing country and never see an entire Facebook page load   When investigating a new market  it s vital that you discover the perceptions of the problem that product solves  assess your assumptions  and that you bring the country s infrastructure to you   It may also be that marketing needs to be changed for a different market  For example in the UK Stella Artois is an everyday beer  but in the US it becomes European sophistication  in Canada Budweiser is a commonplace beer  whereas in China it s a high end drink   Keep doing your research   urges Long   otherwise the market may move while you re not paying attention    About the data  Understanding data from one country to the next can also be difficult  as there are different views on the use and sharing of data  In the US a Zip Code reveals an address to within about 1 000 houses  whereas in the UK a postcode gives an address to within about 10 houses   UK users are therefore understandably much less willing to share that information  It also applies to users  sharing your Social security number in the US is considered highly invasive  in the UK most people would ask why on earth you could want their National Insurance number   Names are also fraught with problems  Facebook for example has run into multiple problems trying to fit people into its naming conventions  says Long   Telling people they have to abide by your conventions for naming is offensive and it will stop them from using your application   Take a look at other local applications and see how they are asking for this sort of information  she advises   Passive data collection can also be a huge issue for product managers  says Long  Fitbit accidentally published all the fitness data it collected a few years ago  and in so doing published all of its users  sex stats  But passive data collection also has a darker side  Egyptian authorities used Facebook and Twitter to track down protesters  names and round them up during the Arab Spring  while the Zimbabwean government has used Facebook to track down dissidents   Be careful about the information you make public and how it might be used  but also understand how people think about that information   Long counsels   Payment  There are three essentials that product managers need to get right when it comes to payment  says Long  make sure the currency is right  make sure the price is correct and that the price shown is the price charged  and make it easy for people to give you money   In Germany for example  credit cards are not popular and people are often reluctant to enter debit card details into sites they don t know  Instead PayPal or bank transfers are popular   User interface  All of one s cultural assumptions show in a user interface  says Long  and users can quickly see whether you ve done your homework  Names  Zip Codes  telephone numbers  currency  can all potentially present problems for users if you ve skimped on the research prior to launch   Iconography can also be tricky  for example what we may all recognize as a save icon  may mean nothing to someone in an emerging market who has never used a floppy disc before   Colour too  can trip up the unwary  In Vietnam weddings are red  in the West they are white  But white is for funerals in India  Orange to the Dutch is royalty  to the British it s cheap flights   In summary  review your text  your input fields  your iconography and use colours that make sense   And finally  says Long  it s important to remember that not all problems exist in all countries  It may be that you find that your product doesn t fit because the assumptions you have and the problems you re solving don t really exist in your target market,"[537 154 561 213 565 288 691 542 284 1316 1204]"
538,training-dataset/business/278.txt,business,Why Founders Should Blog   Austin StartupsWhy Founders Should Blog  Blogging is one of the highest ROI tactics that founders can employ to accelerate growth across the company  revenue or users  employees  and investors   It s often times not obvious how blogging can create value until you ve been doing it for a while though  I ve published over 250 blog posts over the last 40 months  and I ve probably written and discarded an additional 25 50 posts  I could have never recognized the value of what s below until I had done it  Hopefully you ll take up blogging more actively   I first started blogging January 1  2013  Going into 2013  I knew that I wanted to start a health IT company  though at the time I didn t know what that company would be  I was 22 at the time  and knew that I would never be able to raise capital  recruit employees  or sell customers in the health IT space unless the world could feel comfortable I that I understood health IT  So I made a new year s resolution for 2013 to blog 3x   week for the year  I wrote 156 blog posts in 2013  I can directly attribute my blog posts to  300K of the  1M of seed financing I raised  including the first  100K check investment from an angel  I can directly attribute my blog posts to landing what would become Pristine s first customer  UC Irvine  And within 4 months of blogging  I landed a role at the most respected blog in the health IT ecosystem   histalk com  That indirectly drove hundreds of thousands in additional revenue because it made both Pristine and I credible  One of the key tenets of leadership is defining and communicating the company s vision to the team  Clearer  more concise writing obviously lends itself towards communicating the company s vision more clearly  Moreover  Satya Nadella  CEO of Microsoft  ranks the ability to clearly communicate as the single most important skill he looks for in executives  Executives judge everyone they work with based on their communication skills  It s nearly impossible to sell executives expensive solutions if you can t write  Before an executive writes you a  100K  check  she will likely read many of your emails and hear you speak and present  She will judge you based on all your communications  If your business model doesn t involve selling  100K  solutions  think again  VCs write checks that are 1 2 orders of magnitude larger  VCs are also generally 1 2 orders of magnitude more sophisticated than your customers  They will scrutinize your ability to communicate because they know that as CEO  as you scale  communication becomes the only thing you ll do  Writing will expedite the interviewing process for non developers  Use your content as a filter in the interview process  Has the candidate read your last 3 5 blog posts  Can she discuss them  Does she have any opinions of her own  If not  you can reject the candidate in seconds or minutes  At Pristine  I was famous  infamous   for dozens of 5 minute sales interviews  If they hadn t Googled me  stumbled into my blog  and read a few posts  I knew they would never pursue customers with enough rigor to be any good  The top quintile of sales reps never go into job interviews without looking up who they re going to be interviewing with  This filter can be used for all non developer candidates  When speaking off the cuff  people generally use 2 3x the number of words necessary to describe an idea  Writing forces you to be crisp and clear  As your writing improves through practice  your ability to communicate concisely will naturally translate into your real time speech  helping you speak more succinctly  It s hard to believe at first  but you ll recognize the difference after 6 months  Combining the two prior points  the stronger your writing ability  the more quickly and effectively you ll be able to judge others  If simplicity is the ultimate sophistication  and if writing helps you think and communicate more clearly and simply  then communicating clearly makes you more sophisticated  and more able to judge others  sophistication  Define and control your online identity  You never know when a publication will name drop you or your company in a less than flattering capacity  When you re Tony Fadell  you can handle some negative press  But when you re not a celebrity  it s far more challenging to recover from bad press  You can t compete with TechCrunch on SEO  but you can clearly define your voice so that when TechCrunch writes something you don t like  your stakeholders can judge you for who you really are  and not what a TechCrunch reporter threw together in a few hours of research  You don t want your first blog post to be a response to a TechCrunch article  Furthermore  Build your brand  Everyone likes doing business and hanging out with known entities  So make yourself a known entity  Ryan Hoover of Product Hunt and Danielle Morrill of Mattermark built themselves into recognizable brands as they launched their respective companies  As a known entity  you ll be able to get almost any meeting you want  Furthermore  by establishing your brand  candidates and employees will learn how to interact with you  what you like  and how you think  This will reap dividends in perpetuity   Hopefully I ve convinced you that you should write more  This naturally begs the question  How do I improve my writing ability   The answer is simple  practice  My early blog posts were garbage  The only way to get better is to practice  Writing three blog posts per week accelerated the process for me  You don t need to commit to three per week  but try committing to one or two weekly   It will be hard  You may be too embarrassed to publish your work  As Mark Suster of UpFront Ventures says   publish or perish   Get it out there  Iterate  The best form accountability is public accountability  even if no one reads your blog  fun fact  I had about 20 unique readers in my first 3 months   In 2 3 months  no one will remember the bad content because they ll see how good you ve become  If you need help with motivation and enforcement  use stickk com  I used it successfully to enforce my three posts per week rule in 2013   Practicing writing is hard  I didn t do it alone  There were quite a few people who helped me along the way  You may not have someone who you trust to help with your writing  So I ll make a promise to the world  if you commit to writing at least one blog post per week  I ll commit to helping you refine and improve each and every post  privately  Just email me if you re interested   PS  please click the heart icon below if you liked this post  Doing so will help more people discover and enjoy it,"[538 369 241 986 51 1316 896

542,training-dataset/product/386.txt,product,Three Ways of Generating Trust for Your Product45 Flares 45 Flares    Sign up for our product  Tell us about yourself  Fill out your profile  Tell us where you re going so we can bring you a driver  Let us see your bank transaction data so we can give you financial recommendations   Every time you ask your users for information  they re going to ask why they should trust you with it  Somehow you need to convince them that you re trustworthy  but what does that really mean and how do you do that  Over the next six months I m going to be exploring this concept in great detail  but for now I wanted to start with a basic question  Why do people trust   It s a simple question that s hard to answer  Through my research I ve found that there are three ways people develop trust  They do so through first hand experience  recommendations  and intellectual understanding  As product managers  we can leverage these three factors to create more trust in our products and therefore increase users and engagement   First Hand Experience  This is the simplest way to trust someone  As Cynthia  a salesperson at an interior decorating company  told me   my brother has always been there for me and I would trust him with anything   When you ve used something before  worked with that person  or taken that action you know you can trust them again  But if this were the only way to generate trust  it would also lead to a world where people wouldn t eat food made by anyone they hadn t already tried or use a babysitter who had never taken care of their kids  Commerce as we know it today would essentially grind to a halt   The good news is research has shown that people tend to trust strangers by default  Most people feel some form of social obligation to believe the best in others  which translates into trusting relationships  This is how we can function in a world where we don t know everyone in our neighbourhood  Whether this level of trust extends to apps and physical objects is less scientifically studied  but my initial research indicates that the default is to distrust things that aren t people  That means from the very beginning we re fighting an uphill battle to get users to engage with our products   Luckily  we ve got two other trust creating methods to leverage when convincing people that we are worthy of their attention and their data   Recommendations from Trustworthy Sources  I recently needed to choose who to partner with on a project and was torn between two people  They were both well qualified  but one of them was referred to me by a friend and the other person was referred to me via an advertisement  I went with the person who was referred by the friend  People ask their network for recommendations about other people all the time for both personal and professional activities  and those recommendations carry weight for good reason  We can t interact with everyone or everything in the world  and so we need to rely on the help of others to find the right person for the job   But this same form of trust exists even when the recommendation doesn t come from a fellow human  This is what brands are for  Perhaps you have a good association with one product in a brand and are now willing to try another offering under the same umbrella  or you ve read about a product in a magazine you trust and so now trust the product itself  A brand is a recommendation about a product or service  and we use them constantly to better navigate the world around us  If your product is already part of a well known brand  use it  If you re launching something totally new  think about the ways you can find partners to add value not only in terms of features  but in terms of branding as well   An Intellectual Understanding  When you have never seen nor heard of a product before  you can develop trust by understanding how it works  Elizabeth explained to me that despite being an early adopter of Uber  she wasn t nervous about using it   The app is tracking who I am  who the driver is  and where we are  so I had protections in case something goes wrong   Uber had no brand association and she was the first of her network to give it a try so had no personal recommendations  but she knew how the basic idea worked  and that gave her the confidence to try it out   Conversely  even when the something comes recommended by others  some people have a tendency not to trust something they don t understand and will refuse to engage with it at all  I spoke to Bill  a man in his 50s  about his technology habits and he said that he always trusts people over technology   I don t put my credit card information up on the internet because I never know where it s going or what will happen to it   The opaque way his data is handled on the internet makes him loathe to trust a website not only with credit card information  but with any personal information at all   Don t assume that just because your product is easy to use you don t need to provide demos and directions  Even the best designed product could still benefit from creating paths for users to better understand how it works on an intellectual level  That can breed comfort with your product and through it increase engagement   Re establishing Trust  Establishing trust at the beginning is much easier than regenerating trust after a breach  If you lose that relationship with your customers  the only way to regain it is with a full court press on all three levers  Provide ways for people to experience your product first hand  turn them into advocates for you in whatever way possible  and make sure you re clear and transparent about how things work so that people begin to understand your product  If you do all those things right  you ll hopefully regain their trust over time   I ll be continuing this research into trust and privacy over the next few months  If you re interested in learning more about the work I m doing and would like to view the results at the end  please vote for my session in the SXSW panel picker  I ll be sharing user attitudes towards privacy  of which this article is just one of the first steps,"[542 1316 561 154 691 610 985 1390 1204 595 537]"
552,training-dataset/product/116.txt,product,Behind the messenger  the right kind of disruptionAt least Wait But Why tries to be apologetically funny about being disruptive   But whether it s on our phones  on websites  or even inside apps  disruptions such as modals and pop ups have become a painful fact of life  Businesses want us to do something  and it almost never matches what the customer wants to do   And let s be honest here   Intercom has contributed to this pop up epidemic  We ve heard from many users that they found messages intrusive  so it s something we consciously set out to fix in our new messenger   The best messaging experience is when the user feels in control  Yet disruption has always been far from our intent  Our mission is based in part around helping businesses send relevant messages to targeted customers  But just because a message is relevant doesn t mean it s not disruptive  It depends so much on the context of who s receiving the message   where you are  what you re doing  and even your current frame of mind   One behavior we ve seen repeatedly in usability testing is users immediately closing modal pop up messages  without even scanning them  You probably do it yourself every day  It s like an automatic Pavlovian response  Time and time again we ve heard users say   Oh  I just close those pop up windows as soon as they come up    The irony here is that businesses think disruptive pop up messages will give them the best chance of being seen  But by doing so  they actually make their messages less effective  Even if they re relevant and timely  disruptive messages are more likely to annoy and overwhelm  Customers don t engage with the message at all  despite being forced to view it   After hours of watching user tests on web and mobile  that s the critical ingredient we observed   users want to be in control of their attention  and ultimately their experience   Giving users just enough information  So we wanted to design a messaging system that was flexible in how it could ask for attention  Each message type  a post  note  or chat  can be delivered as a snippet notification  Or if you really want to minimize disruption  you can just use a badge notification   This flexibility means that customers can read your message when they re ready  They can finish the task they came to your website or app to do  They can even come back tomorrow and read your message if they want  Instead of software bombarding them with messages  they re in control of the conversation   By being less disruptive you actually get higher engagement   We ve seen that when you put users in control  they engage much more deeply with the message  Sometimes they ll still open it straight away  but because they chose to open it  they re much more receptive to the message  The irony is that by being less disruptive you actually get higher engagement   And just like in the real world  sometimes you have a lot to say  but you don t need to shout it from the rooftops  You can tell a full  rich story with the post message type  but deliver it as a snippet  It s like the person at the party who has a funny story to share  but is polite enough to wait for their turn to talk   A final point here on respecting the end user  When you dismiss a snippet  we ll never show it to you again  On any platform  Your users get to choose how they interact with messages   period  Once dismissed means always dismissed   Encouraging the right behavior in your product  Sometimes businesses need to be disruptive  But more often than not it s the unsavory side effect of immature software that simply can t distinguish between different levels of disruption  For too long we ve witnessed a one size fits all approach to interruption that completely misses the subtleties of how we re naturally attuned to communicate   So what can we takeaway   Interrupting users is not always the best way to get their attention  Less disruptive content can actually make users engage more with content   Respectful communication between business and customers doesn t have to be a myth  When a user feels in control of the conversation  they re much more receptive to communication   There s no one size fits all format for messaging  Different types of content have different objectives  so businesses need a range of options to express content   Ultimately we believe our new messenger takes a step forward to making messaging technology more human  by being more personal  less disruptive  and simply more respectful of end users  That s why we ve built these good manners into our product   so that our customers can be friendlier  more gracious hosts to their users   Editor s note  This is the third of five posts explaining the thinking behind our new Messenger   Part 1  Reinventing messaging all over again  Part 2  Making messaging human again  Part 4  Building a cross platform product  Part 5  Closing the gap between data and

553,training-dataset/product/1233.txt,product,9 tips to help you rock your first  or next  conference presentationA few years ago  my design team encouraged me to submit my first ever conference presentation proposal  I carefully put together my submission  spent some time second guessing myself  and then finally pulled the trigger   Imagine my surprise a couple of weeks later when I got an email saying they d accepted my proposal  I was elated  Overjoyed  Mega pumped  I was going to have the opportunity to share some of the research I d been working on with the UX and design communities   45 seconds later  I was panicking and considering moving off the grid to a cabin in the deep woods with no internet access so I could pretend I never got the acceptance letter  I m an introvert  and public speaking is definitely not my forte   Even though it was borderline terrifying  I was really passionate about the topic  so I wound up going for it  As it turns out  even though presenting at a conference was draining  it was also kind of fun  So much fun that I did it again  And then again  and again and again   I learned some valuable lessons after my first presentation experience and thought some aspiring conference presenters might find them helpful   1  Make an outline first don t touch that deck  When I put together my first presentation  I whipped out PowerPoint and started adding some slides  Then more slides  Then 8 godzillion more slides   Then I realized that my presentation was out of order  confusing  and had no flow  I got frustrated and slammed my laptop shut   Sorry  MacBook    The second time I put together a presentation  I made my outline first  It made the process about 9000  easier   2  Once you have an outline  pick graphics to support your points  Seriously  Keep your hands off that deck  Take a look at your outline  then grab graphics to support your points  Don t be afraid to use amusing graphics and GIFs   3  Open your deck program and go to town  Alright  you now have permission to open up your deck program and add your slides  Your flow has been defined  so creating the deck will go relatively smoothly from here   4  Limit the words in your slides  Your audience will view your presentation from a distance  so use large fonts and as few words as possible in your slides  If you can skip the words and just go with graphics for some slides  even better   If you re doing a presentation that requires a bunch of text  I did one on a research method once that required showing tons of equations   sprinkle pictures in between the boring parts to keep people from falling asleep   To improve accessibility  make sure you describe the images in your deck as you present   5  Write a transcript  Writing a transcript is awesome for several reasons  First  if you post your presentation online  people who attended your session will be able to get a refresher on the details   Secondly  if people didn t attend your live session  they ll still be able to learn from your presentation   Thirdly and in my opinion most importantly writing a transcript makes your presentation more accessible   6  Tell stories  After watching a presentation  people remember stories the presenter told far more often than they remember detailed facts or figures  Want to make a lasting impact  Weave stories into your presentation   Related  Improving UX with Pixar s 22 rules of storytelling  7  Make sure your presentation works both online and offline  Luckily for me  before I headed to my first presentation  a seasoned presenter told me you should always have a copy of your presentation that could be presented completely offline  If you re using an online deck program  download a copy too  If you re doing a live demo of a product  get screenshots or a screencast of what you ll be walking through just in case   The woman who gave me that advice saved me from having an absolutely horrifying first presentation experience  About 10 minutes into my 50 minute presentation  the wifi in our building tanked  booting everybody offline for 15 minutes   But I just whipped out my thumb drive and carried on   8  Back up your backup  During the same conference  I attended a session in which a presenter s thumb drive failed  It just straight up flatlined  He didn t have a backup  and we were using the venue s laptops  so he was completely out of luck  He got through it by giving a lecture and offered to post his slides once he got back to his personal machine  but it was one of those worst case scenario situations   After witnessing that trainwreck  for my next conference presentation I had a copy up on an online deck service  and in case their service went down I uploaded a hard copy of the presentation to Dropbox and emailed myself links to both and I had a copy on a thumb drive in case of any wifi issues  I took no chances   9  Stop editing  My final bit of advice  Leave your presentation alone once it s complete   I spent weeks working on my first presentation  And then I kept tweaking it daily for months leading up to the event  This is a surefire way to drive yourself insane  I was even still editing it the night before the conference   Don t do that to yourself  Edit what needs to be edited early on  then walk away  Unless  of course  you re using stats and they change   If you ve uncovered tips and tricks that could help other people in your industry be more productive at work  it s really not fair to keep them to yourself  Now that you ve got some presentation tips under your belt  start submitting proposals and get up there and share your knowledge   I m looking at you  too  introverts,"[553 1152 833 478 380 191 369 628 561 505 327]"
560,training-dataset/business/987.txt,business,Hiring More Women Can Strengthen Your StartupDiversity is a hotly debated topic in the startup world  and for good reason  While critics of diversity may argue that making startups more inclusive can result in the loss of talented employees  proponents of diversity argue that going the extra mile to recruit female workers yields a plethora of long  and short term benefits for the company   The Founder Institute is looking for promising female founders  Click here to apply for our Girls in Tech Fellowship   In the MakeUseOf article   Women in Tech  What Future Tech Companies Need to Know   Rob Nightingale lists several startling facts about the state of females in the technology industry during the last few years  Here are some of the more surprising takeaways   In 2013  in a sampling of 84 leading tech companies  females only accounted for 12 33  of engineers employed   While 57  of occupations in the workforce are held by women  in computing occupations that figure is only 25    In 2012  20  of chief information officer jobs  CIOs  at Fortune 250 companies were held by a woman   Women s choices impact up to 85  of all purchasing decisions  not just in the United States  but in the world   As you can obviously see  women are drastically underrepresented in the  unfortunately  male dominated world of startups  yet because they take up half the world s population  are one of the largest consumers of technology products  Why is there such a disparity between the producer and the consumer  The reasons for this are multifarious  too much so  in fact  to go into in this article with the attention it deserves   However  what this article can do is help you and your startup to work towards closing the gender gap while also setting up your company for success at the same time   Why Should You Hire More Women   As more and more companies have taken extra steps to hire female talent in recent years  the benefits of having a more gender inclusive workforce continue to manifest  In the Wall Street Insanity article   14 Ways Businesses Benefit From Having Women In Leadership Positions   Sarah Alender lists out a multitude of reasons why companies should include more women in their teams  Below are just a few of the more compelling reasons   Women comprise the majority of users of tech based products  and yet most startups still mostly hire men to build those products  Including more women in your team ensures that you re getting the female perspective  which leads to a better experience and increased engagement for your female customers   Studies have shown that companies with more females in leadership positions experienced considerably higher financial performance than those with fewer female leaders  If you have a diversity of opinion at the top of your company  this will only lead to better management and better business decisions   In general  women tend to have slightly higher integrity than men  refuting the notion that sociopathy is necessary to be an effective leader  Integrity is an important leadership quality  as it increases the potential for being perceived as a role model  and is synonymous with openness  which is critical for making important decisions   Female team members often produce better results than men  Never believe that femininity means a lack of drive and strategic thinking  Because women are just as dedicated and hardworking as men  if not more so  making the extra effort to add more women to your team can lead to increased productivity   Women are just as innovative as men  if not more so  If you are planning to launch a tech startup  or are in the middle of running one right now  then you must certainly appreciate the value of having team members who can think outside the box and hack together solutions on the fly  If you are a fan of innovation  then you probably have a fairly female centric office  And if you are a fan of innovation  but don t have many  or any  female employees  then why don t you hire more females   How Can You Make Your Startup More Inclusive to Women   While hiring more women for a more rounded company can lead to plenty of benefits  it s nonetheless a considerable endeavor  and must be handled with care  sensitivity  and foresight  Luckily  the Startup Grind article   Why Diversity Matters in Startups   by Koh Kim  outlines several steps that founders can take to make their companies more female friendly  Here are some of the most important points   Create a more inclusive environment in the office  Working at a startup can be difficult for anybody  as each day  and sometimes each hour  can bring about a whole new set of challenges  so it s important that all employees can work in a comfortable atmosphere  And because the workforce is generally dominated by men  women can often feel out of place and less likely to contribute their ideas  which isn t good for anyone  Keep the lines of communication open for everyone  not just for men  and ensure that everyone s feedback is welcome   Promote women as leaders and support their career advancement  Taking the time to identify and acknowledge talented female employees  especially in the form of high profile initiatives  will enhance your company s profile and establish it company as a hub of diversity  and can attract even more talent to your company  One way to do this is to create an internal talent pipeline designed specifically to recommend and advance female workers and increase visibility among colleagues and managers   Acknowledge the contributions of your female employees  Too often  male leaders only give notice to the feedback and ideas of their male colleagues  even when females offered the exact same contributions first  Make the effort to listen to your female colleagues  opinions in meetings and ensure that they will be credited for their endeavors  Doing this not only breaks the cycle of men only praising each other  but encourages male employees to respect their female colleagues   The most important thing we can do now is to retain and nurture our current female and minority talent  provide the same growth opportunities and stretch assignments  and promote the best performers to leadership positions     Koh Kim  Writer  Startup Adviser   Gender inequality is very real  and it s having a very negative effect on our society  However  equipped with innovation and creativity  we can make gender inequality a thing of the past  It is now up to you  the next generation of tech pioneers and startup leaders  to build a brighter future for everyone    She is powerful and determined image by Shutterstock,"[560 1056 878 1266 284 131 1011 1316 51 259 1171]"
561,training-dataset/product/1392.txt,product,Insights and lessons from some of the best people in productThe foundation of our blog has always been sharing the lessons we ve learned building Intercom  When we kickstarted our podcast in Summer 2015  the job was to supplement this with a set of new  mostly outside voices   many of who taught us a thing or two on our own product building journey   and create a long form platform to share their equally valuable lessons  Intercom  after all  is about conversations  The program started as an experiment with a Macbook Air  clunky USB mic  fluorescently lit  claustrophobic call room and a curiosity as to whether readers would actually become listeners  Fast forward 18 months  and we ve two in house studios  Dublin and San Francisco   a weekly publishing cadence  and more than 26 hours of content from leading thinkers in the areas of product management  design  marketing  support and the business of startups  Together these conversations tell the full story of a product lifecycle  So to mark our 50th episode  we pulled a collection of our favorite lessons and insights to illustrate that  You ll hear from  Bob Moesta  President of the ReWired Group and Jobs to be Done architect  Julie Zhuo  VP of Product Design at Facebook  Michael Pryor  CEO at Trello  Matt Hodges  Senior Director of Marketing at Intercom  Samuel Hulick  Founder of UserOnboard  Sarah Hatter  Founder of CoSupport  And Jason Fried  CEO at Basecamp Each shares their take on a particular aspect of product  from pinpointing the Job to be Done to creating successful users and deciding when to rebuild  If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed  Bob Moesta on identifying the job of a future product Des Traynor  How do you apply Jobs To Be Done when your product does not yet exist  Bob Moesta  There s actually no new consumption  They re already getting the job done one way or another through a different category  We help people find the analogous categories  products  or situations where people are trying to make progress  but they can t  That s where your technology would fit into it  Part of that is figuring out what other industries to look at  We did some work for somebody who was doing a home health care product that doesn t exist  At the end it was like   Why did somebody buy First Alert  Why did somebody rent a home health care person to come in and see their parents   There s actually no new consumption  If we understood those contexts  because they re trying to fit into those kinds of situations  the context wrapped around that progress is literally the same  We can then say   Based on our technology now  what are the trade offs we re willing to make   Des  When you say there s no new consumption  how does that gel with the idea of something like Snapchat  Are you implying people always switch from something  Bob  They always switch from something  If I mapped the day of a kid five years ago before Snapchat  it was either Facebook or Twitter  They were doing something else  The reality is that there s no more time in the world  You can t create time  and so now they re choosing to do Snapchat and not do something else  That s what you have to be able to understand  The part of Jobs is to understand what they are firing  What did they stop doing  Did they want to stop doing it  or do they miss it  Des  When you hear about emerging industries  a popular one at the moment in the Valley is this idea of customer success  Are people also switching to customer success from something else they thought did the same job  Bob  They re switching platforms  There s a great book called How To Fly A Horse  and it talks about the evolution of innovation  and that innovation is really about creation and creating things  It s the hard work and the fact that all things are really just evolutions of another  Though the business might call it a new category and the industry might call it a new category because of investment  most categories are created because the returns are different and the investment criteria are different  The reality from the consumer s side is it doesn t work that way  Julie Zhuo on why users use a product Adam Risman  At Intercom we talk a lot about the Jobs to be Done theory and believe that people primarily use products to get a job done  They make a switch because another product will do something better  easier  faster  etc  You ve said that in the future you think products will be used because because of style and how it makes someone feel  not because of necessarily utility  Could you explain that  Julie Zhuo  I do think that the Holy Grail of good design is experience that s useful  easy to use and accessible and enjoyable  To consider something really well designed  it s going to check all of those boxes  There is this hierarchy  I don t think people use stuff even if it s easy to use and enjoyable unless it s useful to them  A lot of times when you have multiple products or services that fulfill that useful need  then the next thing you look at is   Which one is easier or more accessible to me  Which one s cheaper  Can it get this thing that I needed to do  finished  faster   Then if that s all equal  what people start to look at is like   I ve got all these products  they all fulfill this use case  they re all quite accessible and easy  and now how do I differentiate    Julie s  Ambition Hierarchy for Designers   See her full post on Medium  The way people then differentiate is through how it makes them feel  Look at clothing  Thousands of years ago  we looked at clothing simply as a function of usefulness  I need fur to keep me warm in the winter  As time passed  it s like   Great  now I ve got lots of things that keep me warm in the winter   What s easier for me to access  Is it cotton  What s cheaper  You get to this market where how most people pick their fashion is usually a factor of cost and then style  We spend a lot of time thinking about all of these different brands and it s like   If I wear this  how is that going to make me feel  How is that going to make me look   The competition is around that highest rung  It s less and less about   I have to get this thing because it s the only thing that is going to make me feel warm and fulfill its functionality   As products evolve and our technologies become better and it s just easier to have more competitive products in the marketplace  the competition just moves higher and higher up in that pyramid  Michael Pryor on how to build a pricing model that scales Des Traynor  Our advice came from Jason Fried  He basically said   Rule 1  start charging something for the damn product   We started at  50 per month  You could be Adidas or you could be two people in a shed having just started your first company  We were charging you 50 bucks  What that did do genuinely was cut a lot of the  never going to pay anyway  type of customers  It gave us a bit of clarity  What did you see in your own similar experience  Michael Pryor  We were solely focused on the product at that time  We were trying to build out the product we were making  taking the profits from FogBugz  Trello was still inside Fog Creek  We were investing in ourselves   you can think of it as we did the seed round  We weren t too worried about the monetization  We knew that that was going to come  but we started to see people were afraid to use Trello because they were like   There s no way to pay for it  They re just going to shut down   We were like   We re not charging people and that s friction  Okay  We need to put down a dirt road for people to see how this is going to happen and we can go pave it later   We then started arguing about the pricing  It s a collaboration tool  Can you charge per user  That inhibits the growth  at that time   We went around and around  Joel finally said   It doesn t matter  We just need to pick something  so we should do this flat rate because people will pay for it   He was right  It was a good solution for that moment in time  We left it for way too long before coming back to it  That was the problem  You want to align your pricing with the value that you give people  We settled on per user pricing eventually because that was just understood by a lot of people  We weren t going to invent a funky pricing scheme based on the number of boards or lists or cards  You want to align your pricing with the value that you give people  Bigger companies pay more and smaller companies pay less  That s one axis that we have  and we have different plans  If you re just a solo user you can use Trello Gold  which is for superfans of Trello  For business type use we have Business Class  For large organizations we have an enterprise version of Trello that has enterprise type features  In the future I could see a world in which you re basically solving a very specific use case with a board by turning on a couple Power Ups and essentially turning Trello into a lightweight CRM  or maybe a lightweight applicant tracking system  There would be a Power Up that does that and maybe you pay extra for that  There are a lot of different axes that we can do  We re expanding with that and learning  Des  Would you consider specific revenue share with Power Up developers  Michael  I m open to that  There s already people building tools on top of Trello and charging for those tools  We don t collect the money  People go to the other website and sign up for that  I already see a market for that kind of thing  Des  If you could roll back and have this pricing pattern from the start  would yo do it  Michael  I don t know that I would ve done the flat rate thing  I would ve skipped that  We ve raised our price a couple times and learned things  We also did a thing that Slack did   we call it smart billing they call it fair billing   where if you re not using the product  we stop charging you for the person automatically  We did that a year ago  and it s been a burden  It just makes our recurring revenue look really weird  People get all these 4 cent charges or credits  It creates a lot of confusion  It turns out that most people don t really care too much about this  Des  I ve always thought it s clever to have smart billing or fair billing  It s a marketing solution to a participation tax problem  Michael  That was the idea  that if you say this to people then they ll just add everyone in their company and not think about it  It turns out that I don t see that actually happening in the numbers that much  We re seeing a lot more cost associated with it instead of the perceived benefit  Des  I can imagine there s all sorts of messy complexity in your billing logic there  where you re charging people for partial prorated months  because they logged in and clicked a link or something  Michael  Yeah  it s very confusing to them  and it s confusing to us  If I went back in time that s another thing I probably would do differently  Matt Hodges on telling your product s story Matt Hodges  There s a very powerful quote that I like from Simon Sinek   People don t buy what you do  They buy why you do it   It s really important to focus on the why  What are you delivering to the customers  That comes through storytelling  People don t typically come and buy a product just because of its features  They buy a product because of the value it delivers  so it s really important to think about the end to end story you need to tell  It s important to start with that at the very beginning because it s going to guide the solution you build  You should obviously focus on building a solution that solves the problems of your customers and the Job Stories that your product team has outlined  but if you can t tell a cohesive  compelling story  it s going to be very hard to sell that to people when you actually do take it to market  Des Traynor  Is that because it just won t resonate  What makes it hard to sell  Matt  It definitely depends on the magnitude of the thing you re taking to market or announcing  There are simple features that don t require you to tell a story  There are things that people know that they need  A good example might be automatically assigning conversations to a particular team or teammate  People know that they need that  You don t really need to tell a story around it  You can benefit from telling a story  but people know that they need that particular feature  When you ship new inventions or a completely new take on solving a problem that people have  you do need to tell a story to help people understand why they need it and why your solution is a better approach  Des  In the case of those features where people basically want them and you re not necessarily changing behavior  then you don t need to tell a new story in a sense  It s like   Hey  that thing you thought we d have  we now have it   or   Hey  that thing you thought would work  now works   Whereas when you re actually looking to change customer behavior  that s when you need something stronger  Matt  Exactly  You need to convince people why they should invest the time changing their behavior  As we know  changing people s behavior is incredibly hard  You need to convince them that the way they ve been doing things is either wrong or is actually not the best way the could be doing it  That s why storytelling is important to capture their attention and encourage them to invest time in learning more  Des  How does it work when you have a concept of a story and you re trying to keep that consistent while also developing the product  Product development isn t linear  You learn new information  you adapt  you change things  you scope in more stuff  you scope out some stuff  Are you constantly rewriting the press release  Matt  It s important to define what we mean by the story  and there are two different stories in my mind  There s the story that the media and the press are going to latch onto   a particular or narrative that they re going to find interesting and they re going to want to write about  Then there s the story that you re actually going to tell the people who are going to buy this thing  and that s what you should be focused on from the very beginning  At Intercom  we re fortunate to have a pretty good process in place for building product  and everything that we build starts with what we call an Intermission  which is our quirky name for a project brief  Its goal is to give the product team and  in our case  the marketing team  a shared understanding of what we re building and why     Download Intermission template in Word or PDF format More recently  we ve started to inject marketing into that process  In that Intermission we have a section that talks about the story that we want to tell once we have built a solution  The reason for that is that we want to have alignment between the product team and the marketing team such that throughout the development process  we can constantly check as we re designing the solution and making decisions around scope about what stays in and what needs to get dropped in order to meet a specific deadline  We can revisit and make sure that we re not breaking the story that we want to tell  It s important to separate the press angle from the actual story that you want to tell to your customers and your prospective customers  In order to get there  it s important that you have a really strong understanding of the competitive landscape  Before you can even write your story  you need to have a strong understanding of what problem you re solving and why  and our product team does a great job at understanding that by talking to our customers  You also want to look at other solutions that might solve that problem or might have a product that could be hired for that particular job that needs to get done  You ll want to go ahead and conduct a really in depth competitive analysis  Based on who you know you re competing against  you want to look at who else has it  how they describe it  how they position it  and how it works  From that  you can start to form opinions on where you win and where you lose  From that analysis  you re going to walk away with a set of unique selling points  which are going to help you formulate that story and that pitch for when you do take it to market  Samuel Hulick on finding onboarding inspiration outside of software Samuel Hulick  A lot of times what you re creating when you re creating software is less of a tool and more of an environment for accomplishment or activity  Any time you design an environment it s going to have a natural getting started process where people are figuring out what it is they need to be doing and how  One of the best IRL onboarding examples is when I get out of town and rent a cabin on Airbnb  When I arrive maybe I ll have phone service or maybe not  How easy is it to find where the key is or the key code is located  If I do get in  can I find how to turn on the lights and the heat  Do I know how to access the internet  If it comes with a sauna do I know how to turn that on or not  A lot of times you ll find that the hosts have clearly anticipated all of the questions someone might have upon entering the environment of their house  and everything is laid out right where someone would most intuitively encounter it  Other times it s a complete nightmare  You have to find this one scrap of paper that s hidden underneath a shelf  It s a very similar process where you re looking to transition people into the mode of life that they were hoping to receive when they decided to pull the trigger on  a purchase   Sometimes you can do that really reliably  and sometimes  if you don t pay a lot of attention  it becomes painfully obvious  Geoffrey Keating  That s probably the challenge for some of these on demand companies   some of the variables are out of your control  It s a two sided marketplace  How do companies like Uber  Lyft and Airbnb design around that  Samuel  The design responsibility is as local as the control is  If a host wants to get good ratings and get more people to come and have more positive reviews they can approach it in a conscious  considerate and hospitality oriented way  If they don t decide to do that then they will suffer whatever types of consequences the marketplace determines based off that  I can imagine that being a concern for Uber or Lyft or Airbnb  but at the same time what they re creating is a larger system that hopefully has some self regulation to it  Geoffrey  What can we learn from industries outside of software  Slot machines and video games are two industries well adapted to user onboarding and retention  Samuel  In both cases those have been very influential in my study of onboarding and the research that I have done in my own life  Video games have arguably been around longer than software  at least in the mainstream  and in a lot of ways the getting started experience is a little bit more mature and articulated in that medium  There are things like first level design and tutorials that are part of games and things like that  I ve been able to draw from a really rich pool there in terms of insights and inspiration  Natasha Dow Schull explains how casinos onboard their customers You mentioned slot machines  There s an amazing book written  about this  by Natasha Dow Schull  Addiction by Design  If you look at casino floor layouts  their climate control  lack of clocks  things like slot machines and even free to play games like Candy Crush  they have really gotten people s brain chemistry figured out and turned addiction to a science  It s regrettable in a lot of ways  as far as the predatory and Machiavellian practices they employ  but at the same time what they re learning can just as easily be used in service of helping people become successful   Ignorance is not something to your benefit  so learning the tools that people who maybe have more questionable ethics are using can be helpful  as long as you re following your own Hippocratic oath  Sarah Hatter on how great support improves product Sabrina Gordon  There s a line I love in CoSupport s Manifesto that says  Feature requests aren t annoying  they prove someone likes what you built and they want to use it more  Stop being so defensive   Could you expand on the whole idea of how the support team can help improve your product  Sarah Hatter  Startup founders and mid market  mid level companies are my favorite audience because they really get it  Startup founders  provided they haven t taken a bazillion dollars in funding and someone else is running the ship  they have the most risk  They have the most on the line if something doesn t work out  They are the ones who are trying to figure out   how do we create the best experience possible to gain those loyal customers who will continue to pay us money   Especially software services   someone s going to pay me  49 every month  how am I going to convince them to keep doing that  We got a lot of really bad advice when apps were launching  when people were doing software as a service 10 15 years ago for the first time  there was a lot of the designer s rights  If someone wants this feature  we re going to say   no  we don t like that feature  so we re not doing it  you don t need it  We re going to retrain people how to work based on the constraints of our product   And for a good five years everyone got really   Yeah  The engineer s right  the designer s right   All these companies started failing  and they re not failing because they said no to a feature request or didn t improve based on user insights  They failed because their core belief was that the customer insight of experience didn t matter as much as what the designer wanted to matter  When I speak at conferences  I m primarily speaking to people in that startup founder  micropreneur stage and I m convincing them  you get someone on the front lines who s empathetic  who s understanding  who s really intuitive about people s needs  and they re keeping track of every single request  words that are being used  and the tone that s coming across from customers  They re keeping track of every bug report and every feature request  This especially is a big thing a lot of people tend to ignore  They don t think it s relevant in early stage life  but I think it is  If you have the right person on the front lines  they re triaging up to your product people   this is a trajectory for us to acquire more users and make more money   At the end of the day  that s all it is  It s not feature bloat  People are very scared when they hear   listen to feature requests   They re like   well then we re just promising that we re going to build everything  and then we have feature bloat   That s my cartoon boardroom version of a startup founder s voice right now  Building a product with empathy of the customer in mind really does matter  I don t think that s what that means  If you re pruning to people  your experience with this matters  your experience using every single button that you click becomes a habitual part of your day  This isn t just a transactional experience that we have  like the Mitch Hedburg joke with the doughnut  I don t need a receipt for a doughnut  You give me the doughnut  I give you the money  end of transaction  That s not what we want to build  If you want to build it that way  then you can go work for Samsung or whomever  but if you really want to build a company and a brand and a product that lasts and impacts people s lives  makes their lives easier  and makes them loyal to you for 10 plus years  you have to come at this idea that building a product with empathy of the customer in mind really does matter  The endgame is we make more money  That s what it is  I ve never ever ever told somebody to listen to people and kindly reference and track feature requests and talk about it with product  who said   I went bankrupt because of that   That s never happened  I talk a lot about hiring people who have that intuition  because I m really anti phone support  It s too emotionally charged  it costs way too much money  and companies end up offshoring it because it s so expensive  so people end up getting this bad experience  I always say   Why do people want phone support  Why do they want a telephone number to call   It s not because they want to stay on hold for fifteen minutes  it s not because they want to get accidentally cut off  it s not because they want to repeat their problem to four middle managers before they get someone to give them a coupon code  They want to trust you  they want to know that you re a human being who can help them  They want immediate help to an immediate need or to fix something  What is the root cause of someone saying   Can you add another checkbox here  or a dropdown here  or can I add another user here   What s the use case  Why do you need that  And we may find that s not what we need to build for this person  We need to build a whole other scenario that fits around this subset of users who we could acquire if we just had this extra feature with this extra scaling capacity  Jason Fried on when a successful product calls for overhaul Des Traynor  One thing that s really interesting to me is how your release patterns have changed  You now seem to release a new ground up version of the product every few years while still maintaining the previous ones  Why are you doing that  Jason Fried  It s averaged out to about every four years we do a major new release  ground up  We do that because at a certain point  you achieve the  local maximum   Think about it like a car  Cars have generations  You have the Porsche 911  which has been around for 50 years  You have the Honda Accord  which has been around for 40 years  But every 5  6  7 years  there s a new chassis  a new engine  a new idea  They start over from scratch  but it still follows the same pattern,"[561 154 610 327 1390 529 680 1316 987 232 691]"

567,training-dataset/business/480.txt,business,To Quickly Build Trust  Tell Your Origin Story   The Mission   MediumTo Quickly Build Trust  Tell Your Origin Story  Photo credit  Leo Leung  People want to know why you do what you do   If you re an entrepreneur  your investors  customers  and employees want to know why you founded your company  Apply for a job  and recruiters ask about your career path  If you re a freelancer  everyone is curious about how you got started   Why do we crave origin stories  Because they reveal character  Superman is a good guy because his planet exploded  his parents sent him to Earth  and the Kents raised him to fight evil  Steve Jobs became a trusted CEO  in part  by bouncing back from failure  My dad thrived as a home builder  but only after terminating a partnership with a prominent colleague whose practices he found unethical   In other words   Your origin story helps people decide whether or not to trust you   How to Craft a Powerful Origin Story  The 5 Essential Elements  In strategic messaging and positioning engagements with CEOs  as well as business storytelling workshops for teams  I ve helped hundreds of people construct origin stories  The best instantly convey not only trustworthiness  but also traits like commitment  persistence  and curiosity   So what makes a great origin story work   At the heart of every great origin story is a single event that forever changes the course of the teller s life  Typically it arises out of failure or disappointment  sometimes it s an unexpected discovery  Very frequently  another person illuminates a new way forward   Can you pinpoint the event that set you on your current path   Yes  we all have one   The event doesn t have to be life changing in the  I won the lottery  sense  though congrats if that happened   It just has to reorient you towards what you re doing now   Once you ve identified your event  construct your origin story around it using the following five components  and tell it in this order   1  Once upon a time   How was your life before the life changing event  Most importantly  what did you want back then  Share relevant details  How old were you  Where did you live  When did this happen   No  you don t literally have to start with  Once upon a time     For example  here s the  Once upon a time   for my origin story   Back in the dot com years  I was living in Manhattan  struggling to fund my startup  It was not going well  One VC attached a hand written note to his standard rejection letter   Andy  I rate every business plan I receive on a scale of one to 10  Yours is a one   At the bottom  he wrote   P S  Not a compelling story    2   Then one day    Next  describe your life changing event  If possible  tell this section as a scene with details that the listener can sense  visualize  hear  smell  etc    Again  here s mine   One day  I m walking up Broadway  when I notice a huge sign in the window of a Barnes and Noble  The sign says   For anyone who wants to tell a compelling story   and it s pointing to a book about screenwriting  I buy the book   3   Because of that    What relevant events were then set in motion  What obstacles did you have to overcome  Basically  describe what happened next   That night  I read the book from cover to cover  It s written in the language of feature films  three act structure  etc    but much of it seems to apply to telling the story of a startup  I rewrite my pitch and send it to a new batch of investors   4   Until finally    What was the turning point   the moment when you really committed to the new path  It s especially effective to reflect here on how you changed and what you learned   After receiving the revised pitch  several investor groups invite my team to their offices  and four months later we have a term sheet from a prominent Silicon Valley venture firm  The numbers  the team   all remained same  The only thing that changed was how we told our story   5   So now    Last but not least  describe what you do now  and connect it to the story   So now I help leadership teams craft strategic messaging and positioning  which is really just their story   the story they use to power fundraising  sales  marketing  recruiting  and product  I also teach storytelling workshops for teams  And I can trace it all back to my failed pitch   Swap Origin Stories with Others to Quickly Build Stronger Relationships  Once you ve drafted your own origin story  tell it a few times to see what works  That s not to say you should introduce yourself to strangers with  Once upon a time     But if you re embarking on a relationship with someone new   a customer  a prospect  an investor  and they ask  try it out  Pay particular attention to where they lean in   Also  ask others to tell you their origin stories  Listen closely  and you ll quickly learn about their character  values and desires  which can be helpful in all sorts of relationships   As one woman in my recent General Assembly workshop said after swapping origin stories with a classmate   There s something about sharing these stories that makes me feel instantly connected,"[567 1314 232 987 868 561

575,training-dataset/product/1082.txt,product,Finding Flow in Your Product Management Career73 Flares 73 Flares    A few years ago  I wrote a couple of blog posts about working as a consultant in product management  At that time in London   we re talking 2011 2012   it was  dare I say  a bold step to leave a full time  good product position to go freelance   I m happy to say that over the past few years  I ve never once regretted making that move  Five years on  I m still independent and have had a chance to work on some amazing projects that have given me the opportunity to learn so much and extend my dossier to mentoring  coaching  teaching  organisational design and transformation  It s been a good run and I find that I truly enjoy the challenges that this variety of projects has brought me   Throughout this time I ve continued to hear from product managers who read those original posts and are curious about taking that step into freelance  Typically  there s a spike in contacts at the start of a year  and yet again in the last few weeks many people from around the world have been getting in touch to ask about product consulting and freelancing   New Year  new you   The trend makes perfect sense  as many of us take time out over the holidays to consider changes we may want to make in the new year  New year  new you  right  What I find intriguing is that the interest in the topic seems to continue to grow  I receive more emails every year   In the spirit of continuing to educate myself as to why consulting works so well for me   and why it may work for you   I ve done some research into what can bring us fulfilment and happiness at work   Before I continue  full disclosure that I m neither an organisational behaviourist  nor a psychologist  I m just an interested party who loves to understand what makes us and the organisations we work in tick   Caveat complete   on with the research  There is so much available about being happy and more efficient at work  but not always a direct correlation between those two  by the way    Find Your Flow  One of the areas that caught my attention was flow theory  developed by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi  For those of you unfamiliar with the theory  Csikszentmihalyi describes a flow like experience as    being completely involved in an activity for its own sake  The ego falls away  Time flies  Every action  movement  and thought follows inevitably from the previous one  like playing jazz  Your whole being is involved  and you re using your skills to the utmost    According to Csikszentmihalyi  when in flow people report  feeling more active  alert  concentrated  happy  satisfied and creative    Not a bad way to feel  eh   Like many of you  I ve tried to create products that enable users to enter flow  sometimes with more success than others  As a consultant  I ve also seen many organisations try to create a culture in which their product  design and development teams can live in a continual state of flow and be  in the zone   Again  some with more success than others   Hopefully  we can all attest to the sort of highs that we experience with moments of flow  but have we thought about what is the optimal situation to create flow for ourselves  Personally  I was curious if there is a relationship between the style of work that I have with consulting and feeling flow   Obliged to Work  With those questions in mind  I recently read an article called  Optimal Experience for Work and Leisure  by Csikszentmihalyi and Judith LeFevre  1989   For those of you interested in more details of the study  you can read it here  For those others of you who want to jump to the findings  here s a summary  Contrary to Csikszentmihalyi and LeFevre s initial expectations  flow occurred three times more often for the study participants in work environments than leisure   Leisure was defined as activities like reading  watching TV  socialising  daydreaming  games and sports   The study concluded that  the most positive experiences in people s lives seem to come more frequently from work than from leisure    There were two noted exceptions   in areas of motivation and relaxation  participants were much less  sensitive to flow  at work  This led Csikszentmihalyi and LeFevre to a great paradox that I m sure we have all felt  while we have many more positive feelings at work than when we binge watch the latest series on Netflix or browse Facebook  in general  we say that we wish we were doing something else when at work   Here s where I felt this study became really relevant  at least to me   Csikszentmihalyi and LeFevre hypothesised that this was because we feel an obligation toward work that we don t feel at play   Apparently the obligatory nature of work masks the positive experiences it engenders    So  it seems  if we don t feel obligated to work but instead see it as a way to bring fulfilment to our lives   we may enjoy it more   All About Choice  For me  this was a Eureka moment  As a consultant I don t feel obliged to have a regular day at an office  and if I m at an office regularly it s my choice  The projects I work on are my choice  In my mind  I ve brought a sense of free will to my approach to work that makes it feel much less of an obligation and more of an opportunity  And  while I m often working more hours as a consultant than I did in my full time job  I don t mind  because it doesn t feel like an obligation  It doesn t feel like work   I m not saying that everyone should go freelance  or that it s right for you  Only you can answer that  I think Csikszentmihalyi and LeFevre s findings provide a great suggestion that can be applied to your existing work experience  Can you shift your mindset about work  Realise that work is a place of opportunity for fulfilment and flow   not an obligation   This may not be an easy thing to do  and for me it took changing my way of working entirely to make it happen  When you get there   your own career flow   it feels great  and I do believe my opportunities to experience flow at work have grown significantly   Now  it s up to you  It s a new year   filled with 12 months of opportunity  How will you approach your work in 2017   If you d like to see more from Csikszentmihalyi  check out his Ted talk here,"[575 456 1316 154 609 313 801 799 51 825

583,training-dataset/business/1408.txt,business,When Fear Is a Competitive Advantage   4 Steps to Make It Work for YouEntrepreneurs are psychologically unique  In a world where up to 90  of startups fail  the most enduring visionaries will push through  energized by the idea of experiencing freedom and success alongside the 10  who beat the odds  They re resilient  They re adaptable  They re extreme risk takers  The most successful entrepreneurs tend to run toward uncertainty and threat instead of running away  Why  The reason  at least according to psychologists  is that successful entrepreneurs tend to have one mindset about fear that the rest of us simply don t share  at least not to the same extent  If harnessed in the right ways  understanding our fears and anxieties can lead us to breakthrough self discoveries  innovation  and creativity  For exceptional entrepreneurs  noticing fear is a competitive advantage  it s an emotion that we dive into with curiosity  passion  and a hunger for exponential growth   The good news is  these critical mindsets around fear can be learned   Serial entrepreneur and executive coach Justin Milano has experienced success and failure   but it s the failure that changed his life   I was building a company to solve one of the greatest environmental challenges we face today  food waste   he says  Then  his greatest fear became a reality  The company failed  and in the soul searching that followed  he saw his motivations in a truer light   I realized there was an unconscious part of me looking to do something grandiose because I didn t fully value and love myself  I was trying to prove my self worth   He wasn t afraid of his business failing  he was afraid of feeling like a failure  There s a big difference between the two  but they re often strongly related   At least  that s what Milano learned after a satisfying bit of symmetry  What seemed like his greatest failure led to his greatest success  co founding Good Startups  an executive coaching company for startups that focuses on cutting edge leadership psychology  neuroscience  and emotional intelligence  What he had started to understand intuitively  his eventual cofounder  Dr  Daniel Cordaro  Director of Wellbeing at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence  had already been studying across cultures for nearly a decade  In 2015  they teamed up to use their mix of scientific expertise and on the ground startup experience to help founders and their teams identify and manage their fears and anxieties  and more importantly  understand the deeper psychology blocking them from self mastery and sustainable high performance   There are a lot of entrepreneurs out there unconsciously trying to prove their self worth through their companies   In this exclusive interview  Milano and Cordaro break down a 4 step process to transforming your fear and anxiety into a competitive advantage  You will learn   The important difference between fear and anxiety  How to uncover the sources of your anxiety  The neuroscience behind reliably transforming your fear into creative power  Effective tools for navigating fear in the moment  When you practice and master these tools  the result is better decision making  expanded performance and energy  more inspirational leadership  and a doorway to self mastery  It s scientifically evidenced    The best entrepreneurs of our time experience fear   says Milano   It s their relationship with fear that differentiates them    Step 1  Understand Your Relationship to Fear  First things first  to transform your relationship to fear and anxiety  you need to define what you re dealing with   Fear is a raw emotion that happens instantly to ensure our survival and safety  like getting out of the way of a moving car   says Cordaro   With anxiety  we are anticipating future threats based on our imagination  or trying to avoid painful experiences from the past  again based on mental projections  Fear typically lasts seconds  and anxiety is often chronic and can last for days or even months    Milano offered one of his favorite quotes from Mark Twain to demonstrate anxiety in action   I m an old man and have known a great many troubles  but most of them never happened   As entrepreneurs  every day we are faced with uncertainty and risk  and when things are unknown  it s natural to have anxiety  Some common anxiety thoughts include   What happens if we run out of money    What if this product launch fails  will I get fired by the board   In Milano s experience  even his clients that are thriving at the highest level experience chronic anxiety thoughts like  Where is the next big win going to come from   or  How do I continue justifying this massive valuation    The key point is that 99  of the time when people say they are experiencing fear  they are actually experiencing anxiety around events that may never happen  When this anxiety is playing like a broken record in our subconscious mind throughout the day  we are hanging out in our limbic brain  specifically the amygdala  which is responsible for our reactions to threat  When we are seeing the world through the lens of threat  we experience tunnel vision and limited possibilities   When we only see limited possibilities   this dramatically impairs our decision making ability  which as an entrepreneur  is one of our most important leadership assets   said Cordaro   Whether we like to admit it or not  every decision we make goes through an emotion filter first  and fear is one of the most powerful emotion filters  Think of it this way  Are your decisions different from a place of joy and happiness versus sadness and despair  Most often yes  so it s important to recognize that emotional intelligence is an essential skill set for entrepreneurial leaders    Step 2  Uncovering the Sources of our Anxiety  Once you recognize that what you are experiencing is most likely anxiety  the question becomes how do you release the grip of anxiety so you can operate with expanded awareness and creativity   Milano offers that the first step toward uncovering the source of your anxiety is to pay attention to your attachments to certain outcomes and identities   Anxiety is the fear of more fear  It s fueled by attachment  It is rooted in the need to control the things around us to keep our reality known and safe   Milano suggests that founders suffering from anxiety walk themselves through these questions   What expectation  idea  or outcome are you attached to  A specific investor  A specific client  A certain type of product working  Being cash positive in six months   What identity is driving the attachment  Have you created an image of yourself as the next game changing entrepreneur to investors  the press  and your team   Consider this example  A founder tells her investors that the company will be cash positive in six months  Then inevitable obstacles set in  and it becomes clear that goal is unattainable  It would be easy to descend into a morass of anxiety and what ifs  Will the board let me go  Will the team start questioning my leadership   A leader who has practiced uncovering their attachments  on the other hand  can see things in a more productive way   The healthy thing to do is acknowledge the attachment to a certain outcome  soften your grip on it  and use your creativity to design a new path based on reality   says Milano   You get to what s really true and face what s actually happening  Then you can say to your team  from a place of integrity and clear headedness   Looks like it won t be six months  Looks more like 12 months  Now that we know that  here s what we re doing about it     Attachment to identities can be harder to relinquish  but it s critical to consider  Many founders  whether through their own strategy or the attention of the press  assume the mantle of  the next big thing   Suddenly  they re not just building a product and running a company  they re living up to very public expectations   Now if your product launch isn t working very well  it starts to threaten that identity  Not only is your product broken  but you re a fraud  a common human fear   That s one of entrepreneurs  biggest fears  I went out there  I sold all these friends and investors on the next big thing  and it didn t work  I m a fraud    What this speaks to is the power of humility   says Milano  The most inspirational leaders know that it s not about them  They acknowledge challenges and respect the competition  and they are prepared for ups and downs  And importantly  they communicate this to their team and investors   They say   This isn t about me  This is about all of us collectively working together to achieve this beautiful mission  We re going to face some bumps along the way  and what s important is we navigate them together  as a team and a board    Cordaro adds   It s important to know that it s ok to have certain identities  it s totally natural and part of being human  Just know that all these identities come with hidden expectations that can add up quickly  It s much more pleasant to make decisions as a leader from a place of what s best for the company and society  as opposed to maintaining a personal identity    Once Milano and Cordaro support their clients in identifying their unconscious attachments and identities  they go a few layers deeper into the three main sources of fear  which they call  the three cultures of fear    The Culture of Scarcity  The belief system that there s not enough resources  e g  time  money  etc     The Culture of Aversion  The belief system that says  I m having the wrong experience   or  I shouldn t be feeling this emotion    e g  shame  guilt  etc    The Culture of Unworthiness  The belief system that  I m not enough  just the way I am    The Culture of Scarcity is familiar to most entrepreneurs who are often scraping by financially or working 16 hours per day to achieve the next big thing  In relation to time scarcity  Cordaro says   What s interesting is that Silicon Valley is one of the most abundant places on the planet in regards to financial resources  yet when it comes to time  it is one of the most impoverished places on the planet    Milano and Cordaro offer that the Culture of Scarcity is a myth  deeply rooted in unconscious societal programming that can be transformed with awareness and new habits  This practice is important according to Cordaro because  when scarcity dominates  selfishness  hypercompetition  and creative stagnancy do too  When abundance dominates  generosity  cooperation  and rapid transformation are there too    When working with clients  Milano and Cordaro take people deep into their individual scarcity programming to write new  more empowering stories for their lives   Reject the Culture of Aversion  Cordaro notes that the goal should never be to eliminate fear  but rather to acknowledge and accept it  He sees the same pattern unfold with all the entrepreneurs he coaches  First comes a great idea  and the drive to make it a reality   It s very exciting and really fun  It s very desire and creativity driven   Then they start actually building a company  and things get in the way   and anxiety sets in   Now there are things that are getting in the way of my vision  there are things that are coming up against these visions I have for how I want the world to be  Fear is a natural part of this process    Adopt this mindset  and fear stops looking like a threat  it s merely part of the package   In Milano and Cordaro s experience  the following shift in mindset can have a profound influence on founders  When a product fails  when the new app gets two stars in the App Store  when funding isn t coming through  successful founders don t get caught up thinking   This is the wrong experience  This isn t the way it s supposed to be   Instead  they accept those obstacles as part of their experience   the only one they can and should be having  They use the experience as a growth opportunity to become better  stronger  and more inspirational leaders    When your product isn t working  you need that feedback in order to actually create a product that people do want   says Milano    Every time you re experiencing fear and anxiety  there s information and data that wants to be uncovered    Anxiety lets you know when you need to kick into gear  The problem  Milano notes  is when you simply stew in anxiety all day  every day  These emotions will not serve you well if they become chronic  And where there is chronic anxiety  there is almost always avoidance or aversion   That app with the two star rating  Customers don t like it   it needs to change   The person with a healthy relationship with fear can say   This is what s happening  I m going to accept that  embrace that  and receive the information  Now what can I do creatively to solve this    says Milano  Leaders with an unhealthy relationship to fear  on the other hand  often lose the opportunity to course correct  Stuck on how things  should  go  they miss the valuable signal that it s time to pivot   Moreover  avoiding feelings of fear only prolongs them   All emotions are here to provide us with information about the world around us  That s why we ve evolved to feel them  Emotions are data  they ve helped us survive for tens of thousands of generations  If we re not listening to an emotion  if we re not receiving that data fully  it s going to keep coming   says Cordaro  When you allow yourself to fully feel and accept an emotion  it dissipates very quickly  often in as little as 30 to 90 seconds   Seen that way  accepting fear isn t just a nice idea   it s a serious competitive advantage  That broken product or low rated app isn t going to fix itself  But you can effectively halve all of your problems by listening to your fear and letting it go  Cordaro asks   As an entrepreneur  do you want to double every single problem that you have  or do you just want to deal with the things that actually need to be worked on    Be an example for your team  Entrepreneurship is a roller coaster  Let s accept that and fix what we can  There will be no freaking out   Develop an Unshakeable Sense of Self Worth  The final culture of fear is the Culture of Unworthiness   This one goes beyond entrepreneurship  it is an epidemic of the human species   says Milano  The belief system is that  I m not enough just the way I am  I need to achieve something extraordinary to generate fulfillment   This is the culture that had hit Milano the hardest so many years ago   Often when Milano asks his clients if they are looking to prove something to themselves  their family  or society by building their company  the answer is a quick  reactive  no    Most people are not consciously aware of how powerful the Culture of Unworthiness is until they make a major mistake or  fail   I certainly wasn t aware of it    Milano offers that one of the quickest ways to determine if you have some work to do around your own sense of worthiness is to ask yourself the question  If my company completely fails and I fall flat on my face  will I still love and accept myself unconditionally   When Cordaro and Milano ask this question in their virtual group coaching sessions you can often see people stop breathing even through the video conferencing technology   It s a powerful and shaking experience   Milano says   We live in an entrepreneurial culture that  glorifies entrepreneurs as modern gods   says Cordaro   We worship those who achieve impossible tasks and create things that few have only dreamed of  kind of like what Elon Musk is doing with electric vehicles and clean energy  These are extraordinary people  for sure  but when we pin all of our self worth on becoming exactly like them  however  we re asking for trouble     When we are faced with the loss of our dreams and ideals  a natural response is a feeling of low self worth   says Milano  For him  this was the greatest gift of his food waste startup failure    Through that experience I was forced to marinate in my feelings of failure and low self worth  and learn the vitally important lesson that no success and achievement will ever fill the gap of self worth within   he says   No expensive houses  shiny cars  or flashy press headlines will ever provide true fulfillment  I am now experiencing what it feels like to be of service and create for the sheer joy of it  without the requirement for my company to validate my self worth  In my opinion  this is one of the most important skill sets an entrepreneur can cultivate    Through that experience  Milano now leads his clients into their unique personal experiences that are the sources of their Culture of Unworthiness   Maybe your parents didn t tell you that you were good enough  and you re trying to prove that you re worthy   he says  Other times  the sabotaging hang ups are professional in nature   the traumatic experience of having been fired as CEO is a prime example  and now you want to prove you can be CEO    In Cordaro s experience as a psychologist  learning to conduct this sort of self enquiry can be transformative for founders   One of the most powerful things that I ve seen people do is simply develop a curiosity about who they are and why they behave the way that they do   he says   It s that kind of attitude that allows people to be the most impactful they can possibly be in society    Step 3  Move from Fear to Desire  Once you do the courageous work to defuse your unique sources of anxiety  you are then free to transform your anxiety into something far more useful  like creativity and innovation  Cordaro shows us how to do this through cutting edge neuroscience    If you remember one thing from this article  remember this  Every fear is mirrored by a desire   says Cordaro   They are two sides of the same coin    Terrified of public speaking  That s because you desire to share a compelling  well articulated message  Worried you won t get funding  That s your strong desire to raise money and build a successful business  Afraid of failure  What s underneath that is your desire to have a positive impact on humanity   This isn t just a hunch  it s actually deeply rooted in neuroscience  Most of us are at least vaguely aware of the amygdala  that part of the brain  right behind the temple  that perceives threats   the  fight or flight  portion of the brain  When the amygdala perceives a threat  one of its jobs is to stop sending information to the cortex  where we engage in higher level thinking and rational decision making   What most people don t know is that right next door to the amygdala is the nucleus accumbens  which is responsible for desire and all things that make us crave feeling good   Scientists have tried to find where the nucleus accumbens stops and the amygdala begins  and they can t find it  These portions of the brain are intrinsically involved with each other  When the amygdala fires  the nucleus accumbens is firing as well   says Cordaro   Entrepreneurs are typically driven by massive desires   to solve big problems and change the world  It s natural  then  that they experience more fear than the average person  too   But when you re aware of what s happening in your brain  you can reliably shift from your fear based limbic brain  which is where the amygdala is  into the neocortex  which manages higher level functions like judgment  decision making  and creativity    A healthy relationship with fear is the doorway to the part of your brain that optimizes judgment  decision making  and creativity   Milano and Cordaro developed a five question exercise to help their clients understand what their anxiety is telling them in the moment  and shift toward consciously pursuing their creative desires  Why is this process important  Very simply  it gets your brain unstuck from fear based  animalistic reactions and allows you to rapidly shift into creative problem solving mode   What s the fear or anxiety   Where do you feel it in your body   What is the desire being mirrored  What is the desire underneath that anxiety   Once you discover the desire  do you choose to take action on it   If so  what are the creative action steps   Let s put this system to the test by bringing in a real life example of the number one most feared concept across all of humanity  it even beats death    public speaking  In a few months  you re going to give a high profile talk regarding your company s vision on stage in front of 2 500 thought leaders and influencers  Anyone would feel some level of anxiety  especially for those of us who aren t public figures for a living   What s the fear or anxiety  This should be an easy one  but this is where awareness begins  Failure  Bombing the talk  Being the subject of ridicule and scorn  or even worse  silence  from this massive audience  Missing an extraordinary opportunity to inspire major influencers in your space   Where do you feel it in your body  Milano and Cordaro recommend taking time to get out of our heads and into our bodies   When it comes to anxiety  living in your mind only leads to rumination and getting even more stuck in our fear stories   says Milano  Take a moment to notice where the fear and anxiety sensations live in your feet  legs  torso  arms  and face  Cordaro says that for him  anxiety feels like  my heart is beating faster  palms are sweating  and I have a slight tightness in my chest and throat  When I feel that  I know that anxiety data is incoming   Milano most often notices fear and anxiety in his belly  and  by simply locating the sensation of anxiety in my body  and taking a deep breath into it  I move into a place of presence    What is the desire being mirrored   This is your big opportunity to flip the coin to the other side   says Cordaro  It turns out that your anxiety stories aren t rooted in what can go wrong  but rather what you want to go right  For the talk  you want to be a source of inspiration and an amazing representative for your company  You want to deliver a clear message and be heard  You want to activate like minded people and invite them to join your mission   Do you feel the shift in how you feel when you move out of fear and into your desires   asks Milano   It s a game changer  because you ve just opened up your brain to higher levels of thinking    Make the choice  Fear feels like we re being backed into a corner  like we can t escape  but it turns out that we re simply denying ourselves a critical freedom  the choice to tackle this challenge and act on our desire  Milano and Cordaro teach that by asking ourselves  Do I choose to get creative and make this desire a reality    we open up the possibility of releasing our fears completely   Fear shows up when we experience the illusion of being out of control  and desire is exactly the opposite   it s the illusion of being in control   says Cordaro   Making this choice calms the mind and allows us to move forward with clarity and determination  In the end  we want to find the balance between desire and fear  and release our attachment to both  It s walking the edge of the coin  instead of getting stuck on one side    Get creative   Now that you ve started to release the grip of fear and anxiety   says Milano   it s time to use the power of your cortex to start coming up with innovative solutions to act on what you really want   You want to be an inspiration and a great representative of your company  Learn the dynamics of great storytelling by watching TED talks  or hire a writer to help you craft the perfect message  You want to deliver a clear message and be heard  Take some public speaking lessons and practice that talk in front of your team  and strangers  as a top priority  You want to activate like minded people and invite them to join your mission  Have your team work on getting intel on all of the major attendees  and create a networking strategy that sets you up for success before you even get on stage   The list goes on  and that s the point  You ve opened yourself up to possibilities  and freed yourself from the rigidity of fight or flight mode    Step 4  Practice Fear Melters  So you ve gone through the process of understanding fear  uprooted your cultures of fear  and transformed your fears into desires  But how do we deal with in the moment spontaneous feelings of fear that may arise  let s say  in the middle of your talk when someone asks a piercing and unexpected question  In Milano s experience  there are several common physical experiences that are dead giveaways you re having a fear reaction  sensations in the belly  sweaty palms  increased heart rate  rapid breathing  and even accelerated speech   Become adept at recognizing these physical manifestations  and you can also develop the skills to overcome fear as it strikes  Whether you re standing at a podium or opening an investor email that s unlikely to contain good news  a few simple actions can jog you out of paralysis and into presence  Milano and Cordaro offer three examples here   Breathe  You re about to get on stage for your talk  and you feel like you might hyperventilate and forget everything you wanted to say  It s time to breathe  Get comfortable and close your eyes  Feel yourself breathe cool air in through your nose and exhale warm air through your mouth  Repeat this for a few breaths  then open your eyes and notice the space around you   Move  You make it on stage and are about to begin  when you feel a crippling paralysis  Your knees are frozen  and you have that deer in the headlights look on your face  It s time to move  When your body freezes in fear  by gently wiggling  shaking  or bouncing you can stop that fear in its tracks  If you are feeling the adrenaline rush of a  fight or flight  response  plant your feet firmly on the ground to experience that sensation of rootedness  like a redwood tree  These simple body movements are fear  pattern interrupters  developed by Milano s friend Dr  Kathlyn Hendricks  who is an expert on Body Intelligence   Match  Match the experience  that is   There is a great quote by Fritz Perls  who said   Fear is excitement without the breath   When you are feeling fear  you are often excited   says Milano  So lean into that excitement and match it with your words  When you re speaking  for example  start by telling your audience   I m excited to be here    Research shows that the second you match your experience by saying  I m excited   your nervous system relaxes   Just as founders need to recognize fear in order to move past it  they also need to recognize creative energy so they can welcome it with open arms  Here  too  the body offers the most reliable indicators   You feel spacious  balanced breathing  Your gut relaxes  and your adrenals and heart chill out  You begin having fun  seeing more possibilities  generating a sense of trust  and the world looks friendly  You make clear decisions from a place of balance   says Milano   If you experience anxiety daily   if you move through every day thinking   I m overwhelmed   for example   odds are good that you re not letting yourself feel anxiety fully and understand why it s there  That s when taking the time to get present is the most powerful tool in a founder s arsenal  Stop  Walk through the  fear melters   Establish a meditation practice   Mindfulness is all about being aware of what s going on so you re not at the mercy of it    The goal of meditation is not  as many people assume  to be more calm and peaceful  although those are certainly positive side effects that you can expect from a regular practice   it s to see one s experiences through a different lens   One of the main reasons we engage in mindfulness practices is to sharpen our attention muscle so that when these feelings of fear and anxiety come on  we can catch them at a much earlier stage and simply let them go   Then  in turn  you can choose how you will respond  prioritizing the actions that will most benefit your unique offering to the world   Sure  fear and anxiety will eventually make themselves known without help from mindfulness  but left unchecked  they ll do it by landing founders in a state of total burnout   At the end of the day  when it s four in the morning and you haven t gone to the bathroom or eaten all day  that s when you ll notice that you need to do something to improve your well being   says Cordaro  That kind of passive anxiety management isn t just personally taxing  it drains your company s most important resources  too   It s so much easier to live each day kind of like a judo master  working through the energy of your emotions  than to have to take a month off to recuperate  come back full steam  and then just do it all over again  Most of us can t afford to do that  and we shouldn t have to    The reality of emotional intelligence  is that it needs to be developed  As with any new skill  it takes practice  new muscles must be flexed  But as you do that  you will begin to find your relationship to your work  and your colleagues  meaningfully changed  Herein lies the competitive advantage of fear  understanding it  and learning how to transform its energy into massive creative potential    You can change your neuroplasticity  You can go from being a completely hyper  worried  caffeinated  crazy entrepreneur  because I was and come to a place with more balance   says Milano   As you start to apply these practices and tools  and you rewire your brain  you ll start to have a different experience in this world  One of the biggest payoffs to doing that is that the world no longer looks unfriendly  It has just as much potential as you do,"[583

techniques that they are currently using to increase their customer engagement and retention  Use this real life actionable business advice to increase your customer retention and engagement  Enjoy   At NinjaOutreach  our blogger prospecting and outreach software startup  we re always interested in three things   Activation  Engagement  Retention  Naturally data is always at the focal point of understanding how we can improve these critical metrics  While I always try to advocate speaking with customers directly  sometimes it isn t always possible  For example  maybe you have too many customers and not enough time  Or perhaps the opposite  plenty of time but too few customers wanting to meet   In our case  we have had phone calls with probably about one third of our customers  The other two thirds simply weren t interested or didn t have time  As a result we tend to look at the data to get deeper answers to our questions and through this data we have been able to see noticeable improvements in our activation rates  engagement  and retention with just some simple tactics   In this case study  I m going to show you the four ways we are using data and how it has positively affected our customer activation  engagement  and retention rates  Additionally I will include word for word templates that we have been sending out to our beta users  which you can use   Following Up With Inactives  Step one in the process is getting the customer to activate the tool  This can be more difficult than it sounds  Surprisingly  even customers who say they will activate it oftentimes will not  For example we have sent out over 400 login details for potential beta users  but have seen only about one fourth of them have actually logged in even though they requested the details  Consider how hard it is to acquire an interested lead only to find that 75  of them are not activating the software One simple thing that we have done is a follow up series with those who have not activated it  It works like this   If the customer has not activated the software within five days they get an email that looks like this   Subject  Have you activated Ninja Outreach yet  Hey Kevin  I just wanted to check in and see if you ve had a chance to download NinjaOutreach  As a reminder  here are your details  Email  your address License Key  your address Installation takes less than 5 minutes  Download Link  members ninjaoutreach com beta  If you d like me to walk you through it  please schedule a meeting at sohelpful me dschneid If there is a reason you do not want to or can t activate it  please let us know  Thanks  Dave  Key Features  Ask them if they have activated  Even if I know they have not  I think people prefer a less big brother approach   Give them a snapshot of all the details they need to activate  low friction     Remind them how quick easy it is to activate   Offer a meeting  Solicit relevant feedback as to why they haven t activated   5 days makes sure we are on top of activations while they still remember us  without being overly pushy  As you can see data is quite important  For example this email would be a nuisance to anyone who had actually activated the software  Additionally we need to know when 5 days has passed  so as not to follow up too soon or too late when the opportunity has passed  Although this email is relatively simple it has helped us activate over 20 users who likely would not have activated otherwise   Offering A Consultation After Activation  So they ve activated   now what  They re going to need help and guidance  Again it is all about timing and segmentation  We use our data to find out who has activated the software and then allow them 15 days to play around with it  after which we send them a quick follow up   Subject  Follow Up Meeting  Hey Kevin  I just wanted to check in and see how things are going with Ninja Outreach  We d love to schedule a follow up meeting just to learn more about your experience and what we can do to improve things  You can book a time with us here  sohelpful me dschneid If you re too busy to meet  then perhaps you can just answer these questions via the email  How often are you using Ninja Outreach  Daily  Weekly  Monthly  Never   What s one thing you REALLY like  Dislike   What is one value add feature or improvement that we could make for you  Thanks  Dave  Key Features  Offer to schedule a meeting for customer development   Offer an alternative solution to solicit the feedback you want  15 days allows the customer a No Rushed way to get used to the software  but also is right about the time when many people start to forget and move on   In addition to a number of meetings scheduled  we ve receive great feedback like   How often are you using Ninja Outreach  Daily  Weekly  Monthly  Never  If I were using it regularly  I would say it is Daily or Weekly   What s one thing you REALLY like  Dislike  I tried to find influencers by search word Virtualization and instead of listing people there were company blogs  like VMware  media websites etc that are useless   What is one value add feature or improvement that we could make for you  It would be great if the software provided people names and contact details   Funnily enough  our software does provide names and contact details  so this interaction allowed me to point her in the right direction   Follow Up with Trending Inactives  NinjaOutreach follows a SaaS model and customers are billed monthly  therefore it is important to retain them as best we can  Retention is best achieved proactively as opposed to reactively  that is  don t wait until the customer churns off to engage with them  We use our usage data to identify when a customer hasn t used the software in a while as an opportunity to reengage them and find out what s troubling them  Maybe it is a customer support issue that they simply didn t bother to ask about  or maybe they got confused by a particular feature and just gave up altogether   Here s the template   Subject  We miss you  Greetings Kevin  Our system tells us that you haven t logged in to NinjaOutreach in 30 days  We miss you  And we d like to hear from you  If you d like to talk to our CEO  yes  not customer support  our CEO  please call this number                 Or schedule a Skype Hangouts meeting here  sohelpful me dschneid He will be happy to pick up the phone  and discuss how you can continue to get the most out of NinjaOutreach  Thanks  NinjaOutreach Team  Key Features  I offer my personal cell phone number as the most direct way to get in touch and as a way to show my commitment   As an alternative we offer a meeting scheduler  30 days feels like the appropriate amount of time to try and re engage an inactive   Offering A Consultation  You may have noticed that we always offer a consultation  Why  We have noticed a difference in perception between those customers we met with and those customers we haven t  Although we don t have quantitative data to back this up  from our qualitative experience customers we met with tend to overall have a more positive opinion of the software  They find it more intuitive to use and they have a better understanding of all the full features suite  On the contrary  customers who go it alone tend to send me emails wondering why such and such a feature was not very intuitive  As a result  it s in our best interest to  Improve the user interface so that customers can seamlessly understand it   Meet with as many customers who are willing   Therefore  we have a meeting scheduler at a variety of different customer interaction points  such as   Our follow up series  Welcome emails  Our knowledge base  Conclusion  Our company is very much in the early stages and we don t actually have a lot of data at our disposal  We only have a few things such as activation times  usage  and some statistics from the website  However  even with such little data we can still make improvements on our customers experience that will probably affect the bottom line,"[584 117 154 327 561 406 936 1316 598 1045 691]"
585,training-dataset/product/885.txt,product,Multitasking is the best way to do lots of subpar workDistractions are everywhere from social media to emails  YouTube videos to instant messaging  and even colleagues and clients  Designers get paid for their skill and time  But how much time can we actually give our work in a distraction rich environment  How can we focus when so many things need our attention   MIT neuroscientist Earl Miller found that  when people think they re multitasking  they re just switching from one task to another very rapidly  And every time they do  there s a cognitive cost    The production of cortisol  the stress hormone  also increases when there s too much going on  which makes us feel exhausted even early in the workday   Creative professionals an umbrella expression that encompasses careers as diverse as designers  UXers  developers  writers  and product managers can t afford constant cognitive disruption   Breaking the multitasking myth  Most of us don t stop one task when another more urgent item hits our phone or inbox  Instead  we attempt both  Multitasking forces us to switch between tasks instead of focusing or singletasking through a workload  reducing concentration and increasing stress levels   Our brains reward us for what feels like productivity until we re smacked with the reality stick that reminds us there s still more to get done before an item gets checked off the list   We too readily accept these ideas and environmental constraints because modern working life demands we divide our attention into tweet sized chunks  Our brains release dopamine  rewarding us each time we cross off a small item on our to do list  But when all those little boxes are checked off  what have you really achieved   Email  social media  and instant messaging are neural addictions mental candy we eat all too readily  We may not want to eat our greens  but we have more sustainable energy when we do  compared to after scarfing down a bag of junk food   8 reasons why multitasking is bad for creative professionals  Stop multitasking and get focused  There s no easy  quick fix answer  unfortunately but there never is when you re breaking free from bad habits  That s how we should treat multitasking  as an unfortunate byproduct of an era when technology has made focusing on a single task more challenging than ever   Focus and discipline are in short supply in distraction rich physical and digital environments  Even the most disciplined creative professionals can use some help  Here are a few practical solutions for getting focused on one task when to do lists  clients  and colleagues are making it difficult to concentrate   Noise canceling headphones  Don t play the music so loud that it stops you from concentrating  since the brain can only concentrate on 1 6 conversations at a time  Work should take up the bulk of your concentration  but throw in music with lyrics and email  and suddenly you re over capacity  according to Julian Treasure  TED speaker and author of Sound Business  Instead  try binaural beats in stereo headphones  Neurophysiologists have found that these can shift the brain into a much deeper state of relaxed concentration  taking creative professionals into the zone   Meeting rooms create ideal isolation spaces  When necessary  book out a room and block out digital distractions  too just to spend a solid few hours working on a project that requires focused concentration   Block out a  do not disturb  time on your schedule  Put a do not disturb status on chat or messenger apps  or log out of your inbox and remove it from your phone  Blocking off time in a group calendar or placing a sign on your desk or cubicle are also effective ways to gain the mental freedom you need to focus especially if you work in an open office   Give yourself mental  time based boundaries  and start small  No email for an hour  Then 2 hours  then half a day  Reward yourself for prolonged periods of focus  Grab a coffee at Starbucks  or considering its sudden popularity  you might want to reward yourself with 10 minutes of Pok mon Go  Both act as rewards while you re also refreshing your mind for a new session of productivity   Over time  singletasking will feel normal even in a busy office filled with distractions,"[585 25 799 6 670 801 1285 609 313 691 154]"
586,training-dataset/business/321.txt,business,Why anti lean startups are backWe re living in an era  once again   in which startups are taking on some really gnarly technical challenges  These companies are building self driving cars  high speed transportation systems  AI autonomous agents  and mining 99  of the genome that hasn t really been understood yet in terms of how it affects the human body and disease   Many of these ideas aren t exactly new  We ve been exposed to the self driving car  Minority Report   AI that can perform a task start to finish  Her   and robots that can move like humans  Ex Machina   What s new is that it s now possible to implement some of our wilder technological dreams  As a result  today s startup landscape includes everything from products that came out of a hackathon and launch in a month to major ten year long moon shots and everything in between   That in between feels kind of new again because we ve spent the past decade focused on  lean startups   And during that time  a whole industry developed around teaching entrepreneurs how to be lean  The core tenets are familiar  get an MVP  minimum viable product  up and out the door as fast as possible  usually within weeks   get people to use it  iterate  get to v1 1  start amassing customers  learn and iterate from there  At this point  you might raise a few hundred thousand dollars and hire someone who s not building product  If you re lucky  you ll do a little bit of marketing  aka growth hacking  and watch that growth curve go up and to the right  Only then do such companies usually consider monetizing their customer base  which means identifying and building the additional features customers might pay for   The Y Combinators of the world have further popularized this particular way of creating a product and building a company around it  And the process has worked well for the likes of AirBnB  DropBox  and Stripe  It works particularly well when you can identify some inefficiency or pain in the market  unused spare rooms  file sharing systems that don t work across devices  inefficient online payments  and develop software to eliminate it   On the other extreme are companies like SpaceX  Tesla or 23andMe  These moon shots redefine what we think is even possible  No one would ever suggest that Elon Musk abide by the lean methodology  There is no notion of a buggy but usable v1 0 electric car  at the failure rate of a typical MVP  such a vehicle would harm thousands of people  No  these are hardcore  capital intensive technologies that resist current startup trends because of the audacity of their vision   But there is a middle path between these two extremes  That s exactly where a bunch of AI companies dwell  There s us of course  We make an AI personal assistant who schedules meetings for you  And there are many others  Clarifai is building visual recognition software  making computers see the world  Banjo lets you understand what s going on anywhere in the world in real time  The more general purpose Sentient provides an AI platform that can be used to solve problems in a variety of industries  What we all share is that data and AI in particular is at the core of our products   There s nothing wrong with lean but when you re pushing the boundaries of science  it fails miserably  Building an AI autonomous agent  for example  is not for the faint of heart  it has required about three years of R D   We ve written about it here and here   And research is just another word for really smart people   time which directly translates into money   This fact has some very tangible consequences  For one  you need to raise much more money up front to hope to build the most ambitious AI products  While a lean startup might raise a few hundred thousand after launching an MVP  we raised   2M just to find out whether meeting scheduling is a tractable problem that is  could we ever hope to train a machine to take over this task  start to finish   All that fundraising means that you have had to align many smart people  VCs  to bet on you and your vision  And this forces a certain discipline  There is no vague notion of finding your customers sometime in the future  You need to truly understand the pain and the customers who have it early in the journey   This gets to the another odd dimension of these anti lean ventures  which have what lean startups sometimes lack  customers willing to pay for them  This fact alone upends the usual freemium model  Don t get me wrong  I m all for lean  It s just that building an anti lean company allows for ambitious long term product development  which is how you build a truly intelligent agent in 2016  or any other ambitious AI startup   It took us almost three years  more than 80 people and  34 M in raised capital to get our product to market  Paul Graham and Eric Reiss would shudder at the thought  But we launched to a pool of eager customers willing to pay  and we think the sky s the limit from here   In conclusion  Not everything can be solved in 3 months and you should allow yourself to be super ambitious   Cheers   d   This post

589,training-dataset/product/727.txt,product,Staying one step ahead at Pixar  An interview with Ed CatmullThe cofounder of the company that created the world s first computer animated feature film lays out a management philosophy for keeping Pixar innovative   Ed Catmull has been at the forefront of the digital revolution since its early days  The president of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios began studying computer science at the University of Utah in 1965  In 1972  he created a four minute film of computer generated animation that represented the state of the art at the time   In his 2014 book  Creativity  Inc   Catmull chronicled the story of Pixar from its early days  when Steve Jobs invested  10 million to spin it off from Lucasfilm  in 1986  to its release of the groundbreaking Toy Story  in 1995  and its acquisition by the Walt Disney Company  for  7 4 billion  in 2006  But even more  he described the thrill and the challenge of stimulating creativity while keeping up with the breakneck pace of the digital age   Catmull recently sat down with McKinsey s Allen Webb and Stanford University professors Hayagreeva Rao and Robert Sutton for a far ranging discussion that picked up where Creativity  Inc  left off  They delved deeply into Catmull s rules for embracing the messiness that often accompanies great creative output  sending subtle signals  taking smart risks  experimenting to stay ahead of uncertainty  counteracting fear  and taking charge in a new environment as Catmull did when he became the president of Disney Animation Studios   The Quarterly  One of the questions we had after reading your book is how do you  as the leader of a company  simultaneously create a culture of doubt of being open to careful  systematic introspection and inspire confidence   Ed Catmull  The fundamental tension is that people want clear leadership  but what we re doing is inherently messy  We know  intellectually  that if we want to do something new  there will be some unpredictable problems  But if it gets too messy  it actually does fall apart  And adhering to the pure  original plan falls apart  too  because it doesn t represent reality  So you are always in this balance between clear leadership and chaos  in fact that s where you re supposed to be  Rather than thinking   OK  my job is to prevent or avoid all the messes   I just try to say   well  let s make sure it doesn t get too messy    Most of our people have learned that it isn t helpful to ask for absolute clarity  They know absolute clarity is damaging because it means that we aren t responding to problems and that we will stop short of excellence  They also don t want chaos  if it gets too messy  they can t do their jobs  If we pull the plug on a film that isn t working  it causes a great deal of angst and pain  But it also sends a major signal to the organization that we re not going to let something bad out  And they really value that  The rule is  we can t produce a crappy film   The Quarterly  So that s the rule  that s the strategy   Ed Catmull  Our real rule is to make a great movie  Our business is predicated on this  Of course  we need the film to be financially successful  and restarting a film is very expensive  But if we re to avoid becoming creatively bankrupt  we have to do things that are high risk  This affects the entire culture everybody keeps raising the bar  upping the ante in terms of what goes on the screen  This raises costs  so we have a continual struggle to reduce our costs   People coming in from the outside  as well as employees  look at the process and say   you know  if you would just get the story right just write the script and get it right the first time  before you make the film it will be much easier and cheaper to make   And they re absolutely right  It is  however  irrelevant because even if you re really good  your first pass or guess at what the film should be will only get you to the B level  You can inexpensively make a B level film  In fact  because the barriers to entry into this field now are quite low  you can get to B easily   If you want to get to A  then you have to make changes in response to the problems revealed in your first attempt and then the second attempt  et cetera  Think of building a house  The cheapest way to build it is to draw up the plan for the house and then build to those plans  But if you ve ever been through this process  then you know that as the building takes shape  you say   what was I thinking  This doesn t work at all   Looking at plans is not the same thing as seeing them realized  Most people who have gone through this say you have to have some extra money because it s going to cost more than you think  And the biggest reason it costs more than you think is that along the way  you realize something you didn t know when you started   Ed Catmull  center  works through story ideas with his team at a retreat for Toy Story 3    The Quarterly  You mentioned signals a moment ago  say a bit more about that   Ed Catmull  Restarting something that doesn t work is costly and painful  but in doing so  we send a major signal to our company  But there are other signals  too  We put short films at the beginning of our movies  Why  Nobody is going to go to a movie because of the shorts  and neither the theater owners nor Disney gets any more money because of them   So why do the shorts  Well  we are sending some signals  It is a signal to the audience that we re giving them more than they re paying for  a signal to the artistic community that Pixar and Disney are encouraging broader artistic expression  and a signal to our employees that we re doing something for which we don t get any money  While they all know that we have to make money and want us to  they also want a signal that we are not so driven by money that it trumps everything else   The Quarterly  Are there any other signals you d highlight   Ed Catmull  Here is a simple example  so simple that most people would overlook it  our kitchen employees are part of the company  I think a lot of companies overuse the phrase  our core business  for instance   making food for our employees is not our core business   So they farm it out  Now  in a lot of companies  including ours  there are certain things you do farm out  You don t do everything yourself  But this notion of  our core business  can become an excuse for being so financially driven that you actually harm your culture   If you farm out your food preparation  then you ve set up a structure where another company has to make money  The only way they can make more money  which they want to do  is to decrease the quality of the food or service  Now we have a structural problem  It s not that they re bad or greedy  But in our case  the kitchen staff works for us  and because it s not a profit group  their source of pride comes from whether or not the employees like the food  So the quality of food here is better than at most other places   Also  the food here is not free it s at cost  Making it free would send the wrong signal about value to the kitchen crew  Everybody loves the chef and the staff  We have people who are happier  They re not gone for an hour and a half because they re going somewhere else to get a decent meal  They re here  where we have more chance encounters  it creates a different social environment  That s worth something to us  to our core business   The Quarterly  You said that risk taking is critical to your artistic and  ultimately  your business success  Could you describe how you think about risk at Pixar   Ed Catmull  For me  there are three stages of risk  The first stage is to consciously decide what risks you want to take  The second is to work out the consequences of those choices  this can be fairly time consuming  The third stage is  lock and load   when you do not intentionally add new risk  The trick is to make sure you do stage one doing something that has risk as part of it   For example  when you re building a team for a film  if you have a team that s worked together before and it s exactly the same team  you know they know how to work with each other and that they can be very efficient  If you keep going this  though  you re going to end up with an ingrown team  On the other hand  if you build a team with all new people  then they won t see looming hazards  and they can fall apart  So you put together a blend  The mix of new and experienced people is a conscious risk taken at the beginning stage one  The second stage then is getting the group working as a coherent whole for the heavy duty work at the end of a production   Likewise  with technology  we know that if we don t change the technology from film to film  we can become extraordinarily efficient because everybody knows how to use it  But we also know we ll become out of date if we do that  So we introduce new technology  Sometimes it s a small risk and sometimes it s a complete replacement of the underlying infrastructure a huge risk  with great angst and pain  But our people buy into it because it s for the good of the studio  even though they know it will cause them so much trouble   Similarly  if you consider the stories themselves  they re all hard to make it doesn t matter whether it s an original film or a sequel  But there are different levels of commercial risk  If we re making a sequel to The Incredibles  it is low commercial risk  It is very hard to make  yet low commercial risk  A sequel to Frozen would be low commercial risk  However  if we make a movie about a rat who wants to cook or a trash compactor that falls in love with a robot  this is high commercial risk   But if we only made low commercial risk films  we would become creatively bankrupt  Again  we make conscious choices to assume different levels of risk  This isn t the same thing as risk minimization or spreading risk  In the case of Pixar  every film we have started in the last 20 years  except one  we have finished  These are our babies   Pixar s 2007 Academy Award winning film  Ratatouille   the story of a rat who longs to be a chef  was praised by critics for its imaginative premise and innovative animation   The Quarterly  In your book  you suggested that Disney Animation fell into a trap like that   Ed Catmull  When Walt was alive  Disney made impactful films  After he died  the quality went down  Then in the  90s  they had four more impactful films The Little Mermaid  Beauty and the Beast  Aladdin  and The Lion King  At that time  they thought they had found a template to consistently produce good movies  They said  animation is the new American Broadway   So every film was a musical with five to seven songs and a funny sidekick  and they kept doing that  Spectacular success doesn t lead to deep introspection  which in turn leads to wrong conclusions  You see this all the time  right  Successful companies draw conclusions about how smart and good they are  and then a significant number of them fall off the cliff because they drew the wrong conclusions   The Quarterly  You said the barriers to entry have fallen in your business  What other big changes are taking place   Ed Catmull  We can all see that technology is changing and  just as obvious  the way people spend their time is changing  One result is that major tentpole movies have become increasingly important because they bring a lot of people into the theaters  These are a great social experience  although I should add that none of us wants to see the smaller films marginalized they bring a lot of creativity into the industry  It is a real dilemma   Meanwhile  if you look out 10 or 20 years from now  will the changes we are seeing lead to new business models  Change is coming  and the impact isn t clear  In my career  I ve gone through many major transitions  If you pay attention  you can get it right about two to four years out  After that  we are doing a lot of guessing  I can see  though  that more people in this industry embrace change than ever before   On the hardware side of things in our business  the technological change  frankly  is driven by the gaming industry  Even though we were the originators of the graphics technology  which they fully acknowledge and are thankful for  we re just not big enough to drive people to design chips for us  So we are fortunate that there s this major gaming industry and that graphics chips keep getting better so we can keep driving forward   But there is nothing stable in this environment  Disney is in the extraordinary position of having three graphics and animation R D groups Pixar  Disney Animation  and now ILM  Industrial Light and Magic  acquired by Disney when it purchased Lucasfilm in 2012   In addition  we have two research groups at major universities to keep driving the technology  as well as research at Disney s Imagineering  Participating in and driving change are taken very seriously   For Disney s latest animated film  Zootopia   animators developed new technology to render the characters  fur accurately  using as many as two million individual hairs for some animals   The Quarterly  So it s about placing a lot of bets and hedging your bets   Ed Catmull  My own belief is that you should be running experiments  many of which will not lead anywhere  If we knew how this was going to end up  we d just go ahead and do it  This is a tricky issue people don t want to fail  They put a greater burden on themselves than we intend to put on them  I think it s natural because they never want to fail  One of the things about failure is that it s asymmetrical with respect to time  When you look back and see failure  you say   it made me what I am   But looking forward  you think   I don t know what is going to happen and I don t want to fail   The difficulty is that when you re running an experiment  it s forward looking  We have to try extra hard to make it safe to fail   The Quarterly  That s fascinating  Experiments are great in retrospect but not in prospect because you re scared   Ed Catmull  In addition to the asymmetry  there are two meanings to the word  failure   The positive meaning is that we learn through failures  But in the real world in business  in politics failure is used as a bludgeon to attack opponents  So there is a palpable aura of danger around failure  It s not made up  it s real  This is the second meaning  So we have these two meanings and  emotionally  we can t separate them  And we don t actually call something educational until after it happened   The Quarterly  So what can you do about that   Ed Catmull  On the film side  we are making more experimental films that aren t burdened with the expectation of theatrical release but give us the opportunity to try something riskier  For feature films  we try to make sure that a certain number are  unlikely  ideas  which force us to stretch   The Quarterly  It sounds as though you think a lot about fear and how to counteract its corrosive effects   Ed Catmull  Fear is built into our nature  we want to succeed and we respond physiologically to threats both to real threats and to imagined threats  If people come into an organization like ours and they re welcomed in  what s the threat  Well  from their point of view  they re thinking   this is a high functioning environment  Am I going to fit in  Am I going to look bad  Will I screw up   It s natural to think this way  but it makes people cautious   When you go to work for a company  they tell you something about the values of the company and how open they are  But it s just words  You take your actual cues from what you see  That s just the way we re wired  Most people don t talk explicitly about it  because they don t want to appear obtuse or out of place  So they ll sometimes misinterpret what they see  For example  when we were building Pixar  the people at the time played a lot of practical jokes on each other  and they loved that  They think it s awesome when there are practical jokes and people do things that are wild and crazy   Now  it s 20 years later  They ve got kids  they go home after work  But they still love the practical jokes  When new people come in  they may hear stories about the old days  but they don t see as much clowning around  So if they were to do it  they might feel out of line  Without anyone saying anything  just based on what they see  they would be less likely to do those things   Meanwhile  the older people are saying   what s wrong with these new people  They re not like we were  They re not doing any of this fun stuff   Without intending to  the culture slowly shifts  How do you keep the shift from happening  I can t go out and say   OK  we re going to organize some wild and crazy activities   Top down organizing of spontaneous activities isn t a good idea  Don t get me wrong we still have a lot of pretty crazy things going on  but we are trying to be aware of the unspoken fears that make people overly cautious  If you re just measuring yourself by your outward success  then you re missing a huge part of what drives people   The Quarterly  In light of your experience integrating Pixar and Disney  what do you think a new CEO coming into an existing organization should and should not do during the first month or so   Ed Catmull  When we came to Disney  we spent two months just listening  Obviously  John  Lasseter  the chief creative officer of Pixar and Disney  and I were talking with people  doing some coaching and so forth  But we drew no conclusions for two months  about people or anything else  We just watched  The idea is to pay attention to the psychology and the sociology of the people   When you come in and you re the new boss  everybody s rather nervous  They re trying to figure you out  too  So you should start with the assumption that everybody s trying to do the best they can  For me  it s not even putting people on a provisional basis by saying   well  we ll see how they work out   I m just assuming they re going to work out  When they start to falter  you help them  And it s only after you ve tried to help them and they don t respond after repeated tries that you do something   Here s another thing that isn t obvious that we tried to be very careful about  Let s suppose somebody doesn t work out  And you  as an experienced person  know fairly soon that they don t have the ability to do the job  If they re leading a team and you ve determined they can t do it  what should you do  The normal thing is to say   why would I waste people s time by letting a poor leader stay in place   We don t say that  The reason is  if we remove somebody as soon as we figure out they can t do the job  we ve just induced fear in the other leaders  They don t usually see things as fast as you do because they re focused on their jobs  It makes them think   oh  if I screw up  they re going to remove me   So the cost to the organization of moving quickly on somebody is higher than it is if you let the person go on too long  You make the change when the need for it becomes obvious to other people  Then you can do it  I will admit that there are a couple of times  though  that we waited too long  This is a hard part of managing   The Quarterly  As you look ahead  what worries you   Ed Catmull  Everybody talks about succession planning because of its importance  but to me the issue that s missed is cultural succession  You have to make sure the next level down understands what the actual values are  For example  Walt Disney was driven by technological change and he brought that energy into the company  This was sound and color in the early days of the film industry  Then  in the theme parks  he used the highest technology available to create experiences and animatronics   But after he died  the people left didn t fully understand how he thought  So it fell away from the company  and it didn t come back until Walt s nephew  Roy Disney Jr   used his authority to reintroduce the concept  He insisted on getting into a contract with Pixar  over the objection that our software wouldn t save any money  He said   no  I want it because it will infuse energy into animation   He was very explicit about it he understood better what Walt was doing   The question is   if Walt understood it  why didn t the other people understand it   They just assumed that he was a genius  without thinking about what he was actually doing  Thus  the value wasn t passed on  Today  much of our senior leadership s time is spent making sure our values are deeply embedded at every level of our organization  It is very challenging but necessary for us to continue making great movies,"[589 919 649 561 51 1316 154 1390 667 1145 456]"
590,training-dataset/product/69.txt,product,5 Signs Your Product Backlog is a Black Hole  And What to Do About it What is a product backlog for   In an ideal situation  your product backlog will be a lean  organized  and prioritized list of the things your team needs to do next  It could include product features  stories  tasks  bug fixes  and any other product related items that need handling  In other words  your backlog should function as a well ordered to do list of important product action items   But the key   remember  we re still talking ideal situation here   is that every item on the backlog is clear and easy to understand  Items should earn their place on the list  be slated for near term action  and be prioritized appropriately in relation to other items  And just as important  nothing should be on the backlog that doesn t belong there   Okay  that s the ideal situation  Let s talk about your backlog  If it s like most  your backlog probably looks more like a free for all list   a long  ever expanding and unorganized document capturing every thought anyone on your team has ever had about your product  Good ideas  Lousy ideas  Low priority tasks  High priority tasks  Super burning hot crisis management fixes  Brainstorms for other products  A grocery list   Well  that was probably a copy paste accident    And because the list becomes so long  so difficult even to look at  you lose track of which items are high priority  You have a more difficult time finding the right items to place into your next sprints or longer term development cycles   In fact  unlike the ideal scenario in which every backlog item is all but guaranteed to see some near term action  the items on your backlog are just as likely to disappear and never be heard from again   Here are 5 ways to know if your backlog is a black hole   and what to do about it   1  You hide it when company comes over   We don t mean this literally  of course  but the sentiment is the same  Your product backlog is so daunting that you don t want to show it to your developers in meetings  discuss it with colleagues or  frankly  even think about it   Tweet This   If you hide it when company comes over  your backlog is too long   ProdMgmtProblems  One of the easiest ways to spot a black hole backlog is that the list is way too long  Managing this type of backlog is a bit similar to hoarding  You re afraid to let go of any idea or thought relating to your product  but you haven t set up alternate lists or idea capturing tools  You use your backlog as a catch all document  because you don t have any other place to put those longer term or lower priority ideas   What happens  though  is that the backlog itself becomes useless  Like a hoarder sifting through a room filled floor to ceiling with boxes and trying to find the box labeled  half length orange string   you can t quickly distinguish the important and relevant items from the unimportant and irrelevant  You simply have to sift through everything every time  Your backlog is just a large  jumbled mess of uncategorized and unordered ideas   No wonder you hide it when company comes over   What to do about it   Sometimes the best strategy for cleaning up an unmanageable backlog is to take the scorched earth approach   Set yourself a rule  such as  If an item is more than a year old  and it s not a high priority  close it  Assuming you re using a project management platform like JIRA to manage your backlog  closing an item means you won t have to fully and permanently delete it   you can still honor your inner hoarder   but it won t show up on the list as you view it   Like decluttering a home  you ll need to be ruthless here   2  You re afraid to put good ideas on it   This is a perfectly logical concern because  well  it s a black hole   As a product manager  you re certainly no stranger to great ideas for your product  You have them  Your customers have them  Your marketing or sales folks have them  But not every good idea can be implemented right away   so you do need a place to capture and store ideas that are worthy but need to be shelved for the time being   And for two very important reasons  you can t afford for that place to be the backlog   First  adding longer term ideas to your backlog will only make the list longer  less organized  and more difficult to sift through to find the high priority stuff   Second  because these worthy ideas will end up on an ever growing list of other items relating to your product  you ll actually be increasing the chances that these valid ideas will simply be buried forever   What to do about it   The best way to ensure your great product ideas don t end up spaghettified  a great black hole term   look it up  and gone forever is to never put them in your backlog in the first place   Instead  create another platform to house your great ideas   perhaps a brainstorm page on your company s wiki  where people can contribute their product ideas and you can always easily find them   3  You keep needing to tag your priority items with stronger sounding status categories   like  Super Mega Ultra Urgent    to ensure you see them   Perhaps as you read the previous section just now you thought  But my backlog doesn t have to be a jumbled list where I can t distinguish the important from the unimportant  I can tag my items with higher and lower priority levels  and filter the view that way   That s true  But another very common symptom of unmanageable backlogs is that everyone learns to tag everything they add with the equivalent urgency of the Armed Forces  DEFCON 1   So here s another great shorthand way of determining whether your backlog is working efficiently or not  If you know that placing an item on it marked  Priority Level 2  means the item will never get dealt with  your backlog is a black hole   Which is why  when your development team asks you to order your tasks by priority  you quickly end up with seven items tagged  Priority 1    And of course this leads to a vicious cycle  where everyone learns to default to putting Priority 1 Ultra Mega FIRST on their items   because they know that tagging anything with Priority 1 Ultra Mega SECOND means it ll languish on that backlog list forever   Indeed  this all by itself can become the true sign that your backlog is a black hole  You do only those tasks marked Urgent or Priority 1   Tweet This   You know it s time to trim your backlog when you start tagging things  Super Mega Urgent PRIORITY ONE    ProdMgmtProblems  What to do about it   When you find yourself needing to continually heighten the levels of urgency on your list  that means either that you need a better prioritization system  or that your backlog is simply too long   or both   But whatever the reason  the smart course of action is the same  You ve got to prune that list   4  You don t know what half of the items on the list even mean   If your organization is like most  just about anyone can add an item to your backlog  When things are manageable  this process is fine   But what if a QA tester adds an item to your backlog that reads something like this   Sporadic blockage of internal transmission messages detected    Huh  you wonder as you read this new backlog entry  What in the world does that mean  Is it important  Will it affect the customer experience   Now  if your backlog is manageable   only a few items  all well organized   you ll catch this little outlier quickly and be able to deal with it   Starting by asking the QA person   Huh    Because you keep your backlog lean  a potentially serious item like this won t sit unattended forever   But if the backlog is already way too long  adding yet another item all but guarantees the new item will be buried for a good amount of time before you catch it  And even then you won t be sure whether or not it s a priority  because you won t know what it means   What to do about it   Set a new rule for anyone placing items in your backlog  Demand a plain language explanation of the issue  feature  or defect  No developer speak  No QA speak  No court reporter style shorthand notation  Every item included on your backlog must be written in a way that is both understandable and actionable by the product owner   And don t forget  This rule should apply to you as well  Why  Because if your backlog is a black hole  that almost certainly means there are items on it that are many months or even several years old  If you aren t clear in your description of an item you include on the list  what are the odds that you ll remember what you meant 18 months from now   5  Just catching a glimpse of it makes you hyperventilate   In his time management book Getting Things Done  author David Allen describes how profoundly something as simple as a cluttered garage can affect us  Just walking by the garage door can sap a little of our energy  boost our stress level  and negatively impact our mood   That s because when we have an overwhelming task in the back of our minds   say  a 10 zillion item backlog  for example   there is a part of our brain that is continuously spending resources thinking about it  and the fact that we are failing to complete it  It s understandable why that can add to our stress and wreck our mood   This is yet another reason it s so important to keep your backlog lean  organized  and manageable  If you let it get out of hand  it can work on you behind the scenes  constantly undermining your productivity and enthusiasm   even when you re not consciously thinking about it   What to do about it   The best advice here is similar to our suggestion we offered in the first section  Roll up your sleeves  dig into your backlog  and radically overhaul it  Oh  and set up some new rules while you re at it   to make sure it never balloons to  hoarder  size again   Great ideas for the overhaul come from Allen s Getting Things Done book  For example  review all of the items on the list and purge everything that doesn t belong there  Again  this can simply mean  closing  an item   not deleting it completely  but removing it from the standard view you see every time you look at your backlog   Next  apply the two minute rule  If you can deal with an item within two minutes  or whatever timeframe makes sense to you   deal with it now  That could mean adding the item to an upcoming sprint  closing it or even fully deleting it   Then  with your remaining items   and if you ve handled the other steps aggressively  your list should now be looking pretty manageable   start applying priorities  sequencing and otherwise organizing them   This final step should leave you with a well ordered  organized and lean product backlog   one that looks a lot like the  ideal scenario  backlog we talked about in the introduction   And that means you re now on your way to more productive energy  faster backlog reviews  and ultimately a more successful product,"[590 95 905 154 914 1145 598 1285 1316 925 585]"

class of people  right  They must be smarter than the rest of us  Stronger  Luckier  Better   What if I told you billionaires are just like you   and that at one point  each of the fabulously wealthy people in this column struggled through challenges and issues much the same as those you re facing   Wouldn t you want to understand how they broke through  beat the odds and grew their fortunes into billions   These 5 self made billionaires are generous with their experience and have excellent business advice for you    It s fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure     Bill Gates  Bill Gates knows a little something about failure  One of the most famous and successful tech entrepreneurs in history  Gates was first a college dropout  Still  in his time at Harvard  Gates told his professors he would be a millionaire by the time he turned 30  He did them one better  in fact   by age 31  he was a self made billionaire   It wasn t an easy path  though  and even his epic philanthropy work hasn t produced enough good karma to completely insulate Gates from failure  In fact  his philanthropy efforts have sometimes failed  Gates admits he regrets some programs  such as science that didn t work or a lunch program the government failed to take over   Even so  he keeps trying  Each new venture is informed by the failures of his past  which has most certainly played a huge role in his earning the  2 spot on Forbes  ranking of the richest people on the planet  with a net worth of  81 4 billion    If you want to see the true measure of a man  watch how he treats his inferiors  not his equals     J K  Rowling  The world s richest author  J K  Rowling has maintained a deep respect and understanding for those living in poverty  After all  it wasn t all that long ago that she lived in it herself   Now worth an estimated  1 billion  those days are long gone for Rowling  yet anyone who has experienced destitution never really leaves that legacy far behind  Becoming fabulously wealthy doesn t make you any better than the next person   it simply means you have more money  Fortunes are won and lost constantly and Rowling s advice reminds us to be kind to those around us  regardless of who they are  After all  you never know when you may fall on hard times yourself and need those people to give you a hand back up    As I grow older  I pay less attention to what men say  I just watch what they do     Andrew Carnegie  The Internet has forever changed the way we communicate   and the vast amount of information available about individuals and businesses   The world is watching   Even start up entrepreneurs can find themselves under the microscope  to varying degrees  You may think your actions go unnoticed  but apps like Secret and social networks like Facebook mean nothing is ever really private anymore  not really   Customers are watching  Potential investors are watching  They re not as interested in what you say as what you do  Don t disappoint    If you never want to be criticized  for goodness  sake don t do anything new     Jeff Bezos  Grow a thick skin  you re going to need it   Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is a tech leader many

Pittsburgh and found his entrepreneurial spirit at just twelve years old  when he sold garbage bags to pay for a pair of shoes he coveted  After earning his B S  in Business Administration at Indiana University s Kelley School of Business  he did a short stint as a salesperson for a Dallas software retailer   and was fired within a year   Cuban s first business  MicroSolutions  sold to CompuServe

unremarkable daily habit   when he discovered something that changed his life for good  His company  Credit Karma  had finally broken into the mainstream  There it was  A thread about credit monitoring kicked off by a user suspicious that his company s free credit check service was a scam   including a passionate response from a user defending and extolling Credit Karma   Oh my god   Lin thought   That person doesn t even work for us   It was a purely organic moment   foreshadowing the word of mouth trend that would win the startup millions of users in the months to come   Ten years later  Credit Karma has established market dominance  with more than 50  of all customers hearing about the site from other users  It s Googled more than Geico   considered the standard bearer for companies that have managed to build sexy  personality driven brands in patently unsexy industries  Which makes it all the more surprising that Credit Karma pulled this off with a staff 1  the size of Geico s  a paltry budget  and no PR agency help in those early  critical  brand establishing years   At First Round  we get asked all the time how companies can capture mindshare and customer fascination when they have hardly any resources to throw at it  Well  Lin s company did exactly that to create a company now worth over  3 billion  and he broke down how for the audience at our last CEO Summit  In this piece  we share his answers with you   Three Early Days Exercises  Ironically  Lin had never thought branding was very important   To me  it was this nebulous thing big companies spent money on without any accountability or metrics   it didn t seem to make sense for us at the beginning   So when it came to getting the Credit Karma name and its message out there  they bootstrapped their own process  Along the way  they discovered three lessons they wish they d had from the start   1  Survey your founding team to find out who you are  not who you want to be   The first thing Lin and his early employees did was list adjectives to distinguish Credit Karma in the market  But what they ended up with   helpful  honest and pragmatic   didn t resonate with people  They realized they were talking about the company they aspired to create  not the one actually in front of them   Even if you say   Our company is this  this and this  it won t magically become that   says Lin   It s much more powerful to start with your team s honest beliefs and experience   You ll end up in a much more creative and unique place   Get there by asking your employees these questions   What personality traits do we all share   What words describe how we interact with each other   What beliefs are keeping us here  working on this idea   Aggregate responses and find commonalities  Then push back  Are the most frequent answers accurate  Do the words people write down describe the company at large    We ended up with a completely different list of words than we thought we wanted   Lin says   What you want to be and what you actually are are very rarely the same thing  We ended up rallying around  fairness    humility    helpful    relationship driven    integrity    In short  they weren t flashy and didn t lend themselves well to salespeak  But they were more honest   adding up to a more trustworthy brand   A brand is not something you can craft out of thin air  It has to reflect reality   2  Don t copy the brands you love   use them to position your company more precisely   Seizing on the elements you really love about other brands can quickly lead you astray  Everyone in Credit Karma s early team was enamored with Apple  and its obsession with perfection in particular   We thought of course we should be like them   Lin says   But perfection works for Apple in a way that made no sense for us  We re a company that always needs to be moving the ball forward rather than getting every single detail right  We need to be more accessible than Apple  and we have customers that expect us to always be iterating and improving    If I have one piece of advice for someone just embarking on branding  it s to not strain yourself trying to mimic other companies you think are ideal   Instead  use these other brands as foils to decide what makes sense to emphasize about your company  and what doesn t  Maybe you want to convey Apple s same emphasis on clean UX  but you need to iterate more  Maybe you love Amazon and want to project the same image of convenience  but your approach to customer service is different   Create three columns on a piece of paper  In the first  put the name of a brand you admire  In the second  write the adjectives that you want to borrow from them  In the third  place the attributes you don t want to embody  By running this exercise  you can use your favorite brands to more precisely position your own company without mistakenly following in anyone else s footsteps   3  Put your branding  don ts  upstream of your other priorities    Too often  talking about brand is punted in favor of tasks perceived to be more important like design and manufacturing   says Lin   This is misguided because your brand should inform every decision you end up making to set up your company  Knowing your brand will make sure you remain true to yourself as you navigate these other choices  make hires  build teams  grow    Run exercises 1 and 2 listed above as early as you possibly can before you make other critical decisions  At the same time  make a concrete list of the choices you will never make at risk of compromising  changing or betraying what it is you stand for  These convictions will become your guardrails   Write them down and never cross them   says Lin   For instance  one of Credit Karma s taboos was charging customers for their credit information  Doing so would fundamentally change the company s thesis  depart entirely from what they set out to do  and break a key promise to their market  All decisions made in the last ten years of its history have adhered to this central  don t   and their growth  partnerships and marketing have all revolved around it   despite critics  insistence that the model was unsustainable  If you don t clearly assert what it is you will not do  you ll always be at risk of doing it eventually  Install guardrails that will keep you from temptation   The Habits of  Courageous Branding   When Credit Karma launched in 2008  credit score companies weren t just unsexy   they were loathed  Too many of them falsely promised free reports only to spam people who signed up  To break through this noise and differentiate themselves  Lin s team had to venture far from their comfort zone in their brand messages and behaviors  These actions  taken together  defined a branding strategy that took serious guts   Pick where to prioritize brand over revenue   Even when people love your brand  they won t engage with it or refer their friends unless you make it easy for them  This requires building features to drive positive engagement  which can be a tough sell when you re just starting out   It can seem counterintuitive that features that don t generate revenue could be your greatest competitive advantage later on   says Lin   But we built credit simulators and tools to dispute credit report errors even if it didn t bring in money because we wanted to drive habitual engagement with the site    This is one of the key reasons searches for Credit Karma eventually outpaced Geico and its billion dollar annual ad budget   he says   When we started  we had zero searches  And it didn t change overnight  It took us five years to dispel the baggage that came with our business model  We had to invest in tools explicitly to turn this around   The lesson  your brand is like the foundation of a house  You want to get it exactly right before building on top of it  even if it takes resources away from revenue initially   Volunteer for trial by fire   During Credit Karma s early years  Lin spent hours in credit related forums conversing with people to clarify what the service was and wasn t   I would respond to 50 posts every night in addition to emailing 20 bloggers writing about us or the space   he says   Any PR person would have probably told me this was a terrible idea  People tend to be very cynical and pull out all of your flaws  But it was beneficial for us because it gave me a live pulse on how we were being perceived in the industry  It also allowed me to respond to and debunk the specific criticism surrounding our brand  It s better to face the music than hide from it  Confront negative feedback and engage directly with those giving it as a human being  not as your company      The lesson  As a CEO  founder  or early leader  take the time to interact with users directly  no matter what their experience is  Don t let customer service queries and complaints go unanswered  Don t send canned responses  Set aside regular  uninterruptible time to write back  follow up  and find thoughtful responses to people s concerns  Most of the time  they ll be so surprised to hear from you  that personal touch will find its way into conversation with their friends and colleagues  It will make a surprising difference for your reputation   Create metrics and benchmarks for customer or user  delight    A lot of startups strive to be data driven in their decision making these days  But this can mean measuring lots of different things   engagement  conversions  and revenue are typical  It s not as common to regularly collect  review and   most importantly   respond to data around customer delight   You want to implement metrics that actively measure whether new features are positively influencing the user experience   Net Promoter Score  NPS  is a clear choice here  worth using to make decisions and chart your roadmap  says Lin    Studies show that in any given category  the company with the highest NPS score grows two times faster than the industry average   he says   When you think about it that way  you realize brand is not something you can leave up to chance  It s something you have to put quantitative tabs on to make sure you re on the right track  Pay attention to NPS and it will not only grow your loyalty  but also your word of mouth marketing  which is beyond valuable  Today  over 65  of all Credit Karma users come to the site based on a word of mouth referral    Other metrics that reflect delight  percentage of returning users  how often they return  how often they choose to share your content through social media or email  and whether they engage with any built in referral tools  You want these numbers heading up and to the right  Don t overlook them  even if your board seems to be interested in other signs of growth   Track down and reward your champions   There s a category of users you want to endear yourself to over time   you ll know them because of their high NPS scores  their engagement with sharing and referral tools  and their penchant to write glowingly about you on forums and in blog comments  They re people who will tell many others about your product without you even asking  It s worth the effort to look for them and make contact when you do   Your super promoters drive irreplaceable value for your business   says Lin   They buy more  go out of their way to provide feedback  stay longer  and refer their friends  Deepen their loyalty by bringing them into your community    For example  Credit Karma tracked Reddit users who would come to their defense in comment sections  They reached out and asked them what more they wanted to see from the service  The feedback they got was that people were frustrated with inaccuracies in their credit reports  Fixing these issues was tedious and costly  They listened and deployed Direct Dispute in response  which allowed consumers to challenge inaccuracies in their reports with just a few clicks   Remember that your super promoters are not one size fits all   An offer for  25 savings may make a big difference to some consumers and not at all for others   says Lin   You ll hurt your relationships if you send too many emails that are not relevant to the audience  Customizing offers and letting people opt out easily are vital to retention   He recommends closely watching unsubscribes from communications with your super promoters in particular   It s the clearest signal of whether you re creating tangible value for that person   Credit Karma runs up to 15 A B tests a week to understand the behavior of these customers and tailor their service accordingly   Part of being courageous is having champions behind you  Don t get caught taking them for granted  You need people to stick with you as you place big bets   Once you define what you stand for  stick to it  It takes grit to redefine an industry   Running the Reddit Test  As you can tell  Lin is a big fan of Reddit   even though it s home to many of Credit Karma s loudest critics  In fact  that s what he likes about it  It s a valuable tool to see if the company s arguments will fly or die  what messaging works best  and how they can convert skeptics   If you re building a consumer product  you re likely to find current or prospective users on Reddit  You re also bound to find a surprising number of people passionate about any topic   even if it s obscure  They ll be pretty diverse  ranging from informed to supportive to clueless to hostile  And they re poised to be vocal and candid   that s what the site is known for  after all  Exposing your business model and marketing language to this audience can therefore be an extremely educational litmus test  says Lin   Will what you re saying pass muster with people who have no incentive to hold back  It s a way to get a rare moment of truth   In particular  Redditors tend to pick up on companies that have strayed from their values  or compromised on the don ts they may have set forth for themselves  It seems to be a particular talent among that crowd  Lin says  Points are awarded for clarity and sincerity   If people accept your responses to their complaints and pointed questions  it s a good indicator that you re being sufficiently genuine and transparent   Once you ve workshopped language on Reddit  you can take what you ve learned and apply it to your broader audience   Credit Karma s most important  and common  Reddit test focused on the company s most asked question  Is it really free  Essentially  what s the catch  To refine how they were talking about their model and maximize incoming feedback  Lin decided to host an AMA  Ask Me Anything  thread on Reddit in 2014  Under the username CredditKarma  he proved his identity and braced himself  Immediately  he was hit with the question   Isn t this a scam     I thought   If we can survive opening the floodgates on Reddit  that will confirm that we re being self aware enough and communicating this super important idea clearly    he says   I thanked the user for asking the question and  as directly as I could  explained the business model  I stressed that we never sell user information and how we were opposed to scammy tactics  I made a point of not being defensive or hiding anything   His response became the most upvoted comment in the thread  immediately visible to users clicking into the thread or searching for Credit Karma   No one yelled   That s bullshit   It was the big vote of confidence in the values we built the brand around    Lin recommends that other entrepreneurs check out Reddit conversations about either their products or the category they re building in  What are people saying about similar companies or competitors  How might you respond to those questions or complaints  Find entry points into related conversations in relevant subreddits and present yourself as a transparent source of information  It s very rare that this audience gets to interface directly with a founder or CEO  Consider starting a thread yourself to ask pivotal brand question you ve been stuck on  There are very few sandboxes where candor is a prized attribute   where you can get honest feedback while winning loyal fans at the same time   Reddit isn t the only place this is possible  Product forums are also great sources of educated and honest commenters who care enough to tell you what they think without holding back  They ve seen enough to call bullshit  but appreciate well built products messaged honestly  When you re running a startup  focus groups might not be feasible  Running your brand strategy by these people who love rendering opinions for free is a low lift way to see where you need to make alterations before deploying it for the rest of your customer base   On top of that  frequenters of niche product forums and subreddits are often so excited about the products they re discussing for free  that you can learn from their enthusiasm  If you re building a company in a less engaging market  creating an exciting brand around it can seem daunting  Look at the words and adjectives used by people who are genuinely jazzed about these topics  What features or offerings light them up  How do they describe them to each other  Take notes on the lexicon they use about what you re doing  They might come in handy when you re explaining why your broader consumer base should be pumped as well   What It Means for a Brand to Be Sexy  Despite all we ve written about branding on First Round Review  we still hear from companies that believe they can t build a compelling brand around what they re doing   it s too niche  too technical  too wonky  too boring to communicate  they say  If anyone can prove them wrong  it s Lin  It just takes a different approach  And it s more than worth it  because brand should dictate a bunch of actions you take downstream  from how you interact with customers to how you determine which features to build next   A brand is sexy if it attracts attention from your specific audience  That s all  It doesn t have to set the world on fire  just a subset of it  So don t copy others  or feel like you need all the same bells and whistles of other brands  Find your unique voice that cuts through the noise for your customers by channeling the personalities on your founding team  and being honest among the people who are poised to care about your company most  Listen to what they talk about and the questions they raise  Make yourself vulnerable to criticism even if it s the last thing you feel like doing  And don t disqualify yourself early by thinking brand will never be a strength for you    Brand is not just what you show to the rest of the world  It s the living soul of your company   says Lin   It s the way you can constantly iterate and measure what s valuable for every one of your customers  Depending on the size of your company  there may be hundreds or thousands of conversations happening about your company every day    How your customers talk about you when they don t think anyone is watching is an underused measure of how strong your brand is    When that Reddit user clarified Credit Karma s mission  it was so meaningful to see someone take the time to correct another user and provide supporting research   he says   That s why a great brand is critical to building your business  It creates a band of followers who always have your back,"[595 202 782 1169 1189 97 154 561 1316 51 721]"
598,training-dataset/product/1024.txt,product,Love the Problem  Not Your Solution   Love the ProblemLove the Problem  Not Your Solution  I recently got asked about the most common pitfall that trips up entrepreneurs  Top on my list is Falling in love with your solution  I ve previously labeled this pre disposition for the solution as the  Innovator s Bias    In science  one of the ways we attempt to overcome this kind of bias is through reasoning from first principles  The same can also be applied in business   With first principles you boil things down to the most fundamental truths and then reason up from there     Elon Musk  As you ll see in this post  the  Innovator Bias  is a sneaky troll   rearing it s ugly head  not just during ideation  but throughout the innovation lifecycle  often when you least expect it  At each step  some of the most fundamental truths come from a deep understanding of problems before solutions   The Big Idea  When we first get hit by an idea  the solution is what we most clearly see and what we spend most of our energy towards  But most products fail   not because we fail to build out our solution  but because we fail to solve a  big enough  customer problem   All your initial energy should be channeled towards finding evidence of a monetizable problem  not towards acquiring more resources to build out your solution   So how do you find a  big enough  problem   Start by recognizing that your true job is to create a customer  not your solution   Customers are results or outcome driven  Look for a job they are trying to get done  jobs to be done  and study how they are getting it done  existing alternatives    If the job is adequately getting done  that s bad news for you because it s hard to displace an existing solution with a similar sounding value proposition  If on the other hand  you find the job isn t getting done  well enough   that s great news for you  The obstacles or problems getting in the way of the customer achieving their desired outcome is where you ll find space for innovation   This emphasis on problem versus solution was the core mind shift I wanted to get across with theLean Canvas and why I modified the original Business Model Canvas   When I heard entrepreneurs pitch their Business Model Canvases  I heard a lot about what they were going to build  value proposition solution  and a lot about how they were going to deliver it to customers  channels  key activities  key partners  key resources  customer relationships   But I didn t hear anything about why customers would need or want your solution in the first place  or how you would get them to switch from what they are doing today to your solution   No problems in your business model is a problem   The Lean Canvas isn t a better Business Model Canvas  but a different canvas all together  Even though I changed 4 boxes  it is simply the addition of the Problem box that continues to generate the biggest mind shift in the resulting business model   Pitfall  Most big ideas are too solution centric   Antidote  Love the Problem  Not Your Solution   The Ever growing Feature Backlog  Let s fast forward to a launched product   one with lots of customers  With lots of customers  come lots of new feature requests  Who do you listen to   If you listen to all your customers  pretty soon you ll have a bloated monster on your hands  Even if you listen to just your most valuable customers  you might still end up building stuff that even they don t use  The reason for this is that most feature requests are framed as solutions  not problems  And customers are often not good at devising solutions   even to their own problems    It s not the customer s job to know what they want     Steve Jobs  A better way to prioritize your customer feature requests is by first understanding the root problem that triggered the request in the first place  Where were they  What were they trying to do  Why   You can answer all these questions by simply applying the same jobs to be done thinking process from above   Here s an example from our LEANSTACK software   Feature request 1  I d like to be able to be export my Lean Canvas as a PDF   Feature request 2  I d like to be able to change the colors on the Lean Canvas   Feature request 3  I d like to be able to change the fonts on the Lean Canvas   Each of these were simple enough feature requests but rather than just implementing them  we got the requestors on the phone  We asked them what they were trying to accomplish  outcome  and explored why the current product was failing them  problem   In this case  what we learned was that these users wanted to use their Lean Canvases in investor presentations and the default view was not visually interesting enough   Once you understand the job  the axes of  better  get clearer   Instead of implementing their feature requests verbatim  we mocked up a  presentation mode  feature and showed it to them  That s what we ended up building   Pitfall  Most customer feature requests are framed as solutions  but customers are often not good solution designers   Antidote  Love the Problem  Not Your Solution   The Curse of Specialization  As you grow any product  things start to go downhill  To identify and prioritize issues  we invest in metrics  Good metrics help expose the leakiest buckets or bottlenecks in your business model  But simply asking your team for solutions to poor metrics can also cause an avalanche of internal feature requests in your backlog   Here s another example from our LEANSTACK product   Our metrics were starting to trend downward on completion rates of new Lean Canvases  activation   I brought this up in our weekly standup meeting and here s what happened   1  My designer proposed that we simplify the Lean Canvas creation workflow   2  My developer proposed that we add more features to the workflow  and  3  My marketer wanted to implement lifecycle emails that guided users through the workflow   Notice how the  Innovator s Bias  sneaked in here  Each of us are trained to be good at certain disciplines and when confronted with a problem  we automatically reach for our strongest tool  It s no surprise that my designer came up with a design solution  my developer came up with a technical solution  and my marketer came up with a  yes you guessed it  marketing solution   Rather than falling into the trap of collectively loving our shiny new features  after one too many over built features  we have learned to always fallback to first principles  We look for evidence of the problem before formulating or proposing any solutions   The problem with relying on metrics alone is that while they can tell you what s going wrong  they often don t tell you why  To get to why  you usually have to devise a learning experiment  In this case  instead of automatically buying into a UX solution  we decided to run usability tests with new users which invalidated UX as the reason for the drop in activation rates  We did uncover something else entirely that led to a different solution that worked   Pitfall  Metrics can only tell you what s going wrong not why  and your team will have a  different good idea  for how to fix it   Antidote  Love the Problem  Not Your Solution   Avoiding Failure  None of us like to fail but when I think of avoiding failure  I m often reminded of  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy    There is an art to flying  or rather a knack  Its knack lies in learning to throw yourself at the ground and miss    Clearly  it is this second part  the missing  that presents the difficulties     Douglas Adams  We spend so much time trying to  miss  failure that we fail to realize that  Failing is a necessary pre condition for breakthrough   If you run an experiment and only validate what you already expected to happen  you can pat yourself on the back  but there was no breakthrough  It is only through the exploration of the unexpected that you achieve breakthrough  The field of science and business alike is riddled with stories of such accidental breakthroughs  Penicillin  X rays  Microwave  Post it Notes  Velcro  etc   Breakthrough insights are often hidden inside failed experiments   Failing is par for the course when we attempt new things  There is a reason why the hockey stick curve is flat at the beginning  The trick to learning your way towards breakthrough versus avoiding failure is three fold   1  Eliminate big wipe out types of failures by employing small  fast  additive experiments   2  Remove failure from your vocabulary  I prefer the term  unexpected outcomes    3  Finally  chase every unexpected outcome to understand why   A pivot not grounded in learning is a disguised  see what sticks  strategy   Pitfall  Running away from failure only delays true breakthrough   Antidote  Love the Problem  Not Your Solution   One Final Takeaway  Before you go  I d like to leave you with one final takeaway  We pay a lot of lip service to perseverance and grit  but perseverance and grit will get you only so far if you are simply trying to brute force your solution   Starting with a solution is like building a key without knowing what door it will open  You can try testing your key on lots of doors or you can start with a door you want to open  When you fall in love with the problem  versus your solution  you start building keys to doors that actually take you places,"[598 561 522 154 883 565 327 1025 130 1306 1316]"
602,training-dataset/business/1217.txt,business,An introvert s guide to collaborationCollaboration is highly valuable within any company  It allows teams to move quickly on a project  make faster decisions and it helps people from different teams stay on the same track   Something I ve learned is that you have to master collaboration in order to progress your career and become the best at what you do  As an introvert  this has been one of my biggest challenges   Luckily I ve found myself in a position whereby as a Product Researcher  I get to spend a large chunk of time thinking deeply while I synthesise data or work on a report  I also have to continually push myself out of my comfort zone when I m interviewing users or carrying out usability testing  Win win situation right  Well  not all the time   In situations where collaboration is needed  and valued  on a project  it can be hard to pull yourself out of the why can t we do this over email mindset  Jumping from a  safe space  of focus to being in a room filled with people who all want to get their point across can be draining  I ve left some meetings where I feel totally exhausted and look across the room and see other folks invigorated   Not to be deterred or feel downtrodden by the fact that some teammates can partake in collaboration a lot more easily than me  I decided to be proactive and work on it   Caveat  This is a work in progress  I m still actively learning to collaborate as I go but I decided to share some tips for those of you who find collaboration highly rewarding  but hard to do     Make sure it s meaningful  Nobody wants to be in an unnecessary meeting so make sure your interactions with teammates are authentic  Don t waste their time with a face to face session where the team are essentially  circling the drain  over a problem and don t come to any great conclusion  A way of ensuring this happens is to use a quick checklist before proposing a collaborative session   Can this decision or next step be made by me alone   What are the risks of making this decision alone   Would this decision or next step benefit from other perspectives or ideas  Why   What teammates do I need to add this to this session   What will they bring to the session   Have clearly defined goals  Start at the end and figure out what you want to get out of each session  By setting an agenda  you set clear objectives  This will help you to mentally prepare for what s coming up  It s also just a good way to run any meeting since they can be expensive      Some super simple checklist items you can use are   What do I want to get out of this meeting   What are the top three topics I want to cover   If you can  plan   The best results often occur from unexpected  face to face collaboration e g where a group of people get into a room to figure out ways to solve a hard problem  This is fantastic and what should be strived for in any company  but for an introvert it can be pretty draining when this happens   The best way to be proactive about this is to spot opportunities early on in a project that could benefit from more collaboration  From a research perspective  this usually means I plan ahead of time for any kick off meetings  research plan run throughs  general project catch ups and debriefs  I then try to get these meetings into people s calendars as early as possible so that I can mentally prepare for them   Some other things I do are   Try to predict the questions that will be asked in the meeting  Jot down the main goals of the meeting in my notepad so it doesn t derail  I ve found this planning to really help when you ve got a day  or week  filled to the brim with meetings  Doing this leg work early on also helps to keep the amount of context switching you do to a minimum    Sincere apologies for the Johnny Cochran esque title   Get your point across  When you re an introvert in a room filled with BIG voices  it can be hard to actually get your point across  Early on in my career I really struggled with this and I got a great tip from my manager Sian  who by the way is the ultimate wealth of knowledge      She asked me to write down the top three things  usually research insights  that I wanted to communicate in a meeting where there were multiple people present  The aim was then to get at least one of those points across by the time the meeting ended   As I diligently practiced this in every big meeting I attended  suddenly I went from getting one point across to three  Then five  Then I noticed I was speaking out in meetings without even needing to write anything down   Practicing this gave me so much more confidence in what I was saying and it s been pivotal in how I communicate today   Make collaboration work for YOU  No matter what industry you work in  you re going to work with folks that strive for more collaboration from you  And that s perfectly fine  However  it s important that you don t try and completely change the way in which you work for someone else  It s imperative that you take feedback like this on board and learn from it but always treat working relationships as a two way street  Talk to these people and try and come to a mutual understanding  Find out what motivates them to want to collaborate more and share the processes that work best for you   Being introverted shouldn t be a reason why you don t get as far in your career as your extroverted peers  Remember  everyone has different working styles and this should be embraced  especially when it comes to collaboration   If anyone has tips  tricks and processes that work for them around this topic  I d love to hear them,"[602 249 169 380 1316 799 667 609 1145 1390 456]"
609,training-dataset/product/479.txt,product,Facebook s Product Design Director on maintaining a productive work environmentGeoff Teehan is a Product Design Director at Facebook who works on News Feed  interfaces  and feed ads with his teams  Previously  he was one of the co founders of the influential Toronto based design agency Teehan Lax   Recently we had the opportunity to chat with Geoff about his current role  what he s learned in the year since shutting down Teehan Lax  and some of his philosophies for maintaining a productive work environment   Tell us about your current role at Facebook   I m in charge of 3 main groups  News Feed  interfaces  and feed ads  Interfaces is our way of keeping standards and guidelines across all of Facebook  It s the group that looks holistically across the entire experience   There are other teams like search  profile  notifications  etc  that are in charge of some very specific areas of the application  As a result there s not one group looking after the whole platform outside of the interfaces group  Its role is to create standards and guidelines and make sure that the experience is great  A design manager works with me on that  as well as a team of about 10 or so designers   Feed ads is the advertising experience that you see on the News Feed  The design manager on that is Jessica Watson  and she has a team of about 6 designers   Then there s News Feed  I act as a design manager for that as well as the director  and I have about 8 designers on that team  In total  my whole group is about 25 people and we oversee a lot of the bigger parts of Facebook   I spend the bulk of my time working on News Feed  though I m involved on projects inside of that group and other groups  As a side project  our team works closely with the interfaces team we ve been publishing a lot of design resources  tools  and files that help the broader design community outside of Facebook   Since you mentioned being both a design director and design manager  what are the main differences for you in terms of your responsibilities in those 2 roles   As design director  I m there to support the design managers and set them up with the environment they need to run the product team  That means having a high level visibility around what they re working on  meeting with the design managers  and understanding what s working and what s not  Finding out where they may need help  and making the appropriate connections or giving appropriate guidance   On the design manager side for News Feed  I m involved more strategically in what we re doing  and from an execution and directional side of things as well   For the other 2 groups  the design managers maintain close relationships with the designers and the individual contributors underneath them to manage their career growth  The work I do on the other areas  interfaces and feed ads  is relatively minimal because I have great design managers who do the job there and can manage up to me when things aren t working   What are the most challenging aspects of the work you re doing   One is that this is a very large organization  and as big as it is  it s relatively flat in its architecture  There s a lot of autonomy given to the people doing the work  which is great  While there is process  there s not so much that it gets in the way of doing the work   There are also a ton of different working styles here  Sometimes  those things can be difficult to work with  There are people who have worked here for a while who are very proficient and good at what they do  They know the ins and outs of this place  and they like to work with a lot of autonomy and relative isolation much like a lot of designers  Some of them are very successful at that  I think that s okay  but I think as the company has grown  that becomes a little bit more challenging to work within   I really prefer and think we can do better work when we work in pairs or we collaborate a little bit more  Figuring out ways to get people working in a more collaborative way has been a challenge  You can t just put 2 people in a room and expect them to work together  There are certain dynamics and fit involved   There are also times in a project where you really do need to just sit  put your head down  and do some work  And there are times when you need to come up for air and regroup with other people  get other opinions  and jam on ideas   With regards to team management  are the challenges similar to what you faced when you ran Teehan Lax versus what you re facing now at Facebook   I think it s different  What came in the top of the funnel at Teehan Lax  at least in terms of the talent  were usually from the same walk of life  They came from similar companies to Teehan Lax  There wasn t and still isn t the type of atmosphere in Toronto that there is down here in the Bay Area  You get wildly different types of designers here  and that s a big difference  The designers who would come to Teehan Lax typically had been working at other ad or design agencies previously   As different as I like to think that Teehan Lax was  to a certain extent  our working style wasn t unfamiliar to people who were coming in the door there   Earlier on in your career  what was the turning point where you knew you wanted to start an agency rather than go work for another company   It happened twice  actually  When I first started in the mid  90s  I was working for a company that was doing web hosting  domain purchasing  and web design  Then the company went bankrupt   I decided to take a stab at doing my own thing  and I did that for about 2 years  Then one of our clients  a big digital agency called Modem Media  came along and I ended up taking a job with them  Making money again was nice  and so was not having to worry about some of the things you worry about when you own your own business  Focusing on the work as a young designer was a refreshing change and something I think I needed   That was great  but then it happened again  The dot com bubble burst and I didn t have a job anymore  I d been working with Jon  Lax  at Modem Media  and we decided to start our own thing  We figured we d do it for 6 months or a year  or however long the initial contracts we had would last  and then we d go get  real jobs    It wasn t until we signed 3 year leases for photocopiers that we realized we were in it for the long haul  Obviously we were subletting a space and we d bought equipment  and we even had one staff member  So it wasn t like we weren t committed  Even still  it felt like we could get out without too much damage   But signing the lease for the Xerox copier made it feel like something long term  It was like  10 000 or  12 000 it wasn t an insane amount of money  but back then it was this real commitment because getting out of that lease would be a big pain in the ass   You guys grew Teehan Lax into one of the more well known and admirable design agencies and about a year ago  you and your partners decided to part ways  When you ve built a business to the level you had  when do you know it s time to move on and try something new   I don t think you ever know  I think you guess  We had  for some time  thought about it and talked about it  but not in serious ways  We had people  agencies  and companies offer to buy us and most of the time  we wouldn t even entertain those ideas  It wasn t one thing that happened it was a lot of different things   We d done a lot of work  and we d changed a lot in how we did that work  We d really focused in on product design  and saw changes in the industry where product design was becoming internalized within companies   Figuring out what to do after an initial 90 day engagement and how to continually improve a product was difficult  Working at a distance and doing things for startups or for well established digital companies has its limitations  There were times where we embedded ourselves in companies  and I think that goes a long way especially if you re building something at scale  You really need to understand the inner workings  You need to work with a lot of different teams cross functionally  and that s very difficult to do in a 90 day contract   There were many other things  too  where even the personal desires of many of us differed  With everything factored in  we had to have that conversation and try to figure out the right thing to do  Could we have just kept running Teehan Lax for a while  Yeah  for sure  I think our desire to continue to want to reinvent ourselves had waned a little bit  It s a pretty exhausting exercise that needs to happen  and it has to happen on top of a lot of other things beyond just doing the work  Ultimately  nobody was really interested in doing that anymore   It was about growth  too the company just desired to keep growing  No matter how much you want it to stay one size or no matter how successful you are  the company just wants to grow  We talked about opening other offices  Again  nobody really wanted to do it  The challenges it presented didn t interest us  I think if we had kept going  it would have been like a sitcom that stayed on a few too many seasons and became unfunny   What was the thing about Facebook that drove you guys in that direction   We looked at a lot of different options for a long period of time and put a lot of thinking and due diligence in before landing here at Facebook  We met with a lot of great companies  and some not so great   Facebook painted a clear and compelling picture for us  They were incredibly open and honest about what they d be working on  what they valued  and where they wanted to take the company  They also did a lot of good research on us to understand what our strengths and weaknesses were  Early on we had open and honest conversations about some of that stuff  It was very genuine   Compare and contrast that to some of the other companies we talked to and in some cases  they just wanted us to come onboard and figure everything else out after  And that just doesn t fly   The other thing about Facebook is that while everybody at Teehan Lax didn t come along  Facebook probably worked the hardest to maximize as many people as they could  There were some people who simply weren t interested  and then some whose roles inside of our company just made little sense at Facebook  It wasn t perfect by any means  but it s something that made sense   It s been a year since the announcement of your agency closing  Looking back  what are some of the takeaways from the whole experience   Leaving anything is difficult no matter how good or bad it is  For the record  Teehan Lax was amazing  But I think as humans we just generally struggle initially with change  and as we get older we resist change more  Coming to Facebook has taught me to grow through real change and to be more cognizant of how I m actually doing  It s easy to get comfortable and complacent  and that s when you stop growing or find yourself in less than ideal scenarios   I m now a big believer in forming habits  It s how I did a 180 on my health and made changes to how I work  I make commitments to do something for 60 days straight so they stick that s about how long it takes for us to form habits   What are some of your routines or ways you ve learned to structure your day to accomplish everything that you need to do or be a part of in a day   I get up early  at like 5am  and I work out for 90 minutes  I think about what the one thing is that I need to accomplish that day  I don t have a work priority list and a personal priority list I have one list and I prioritize everything on it  Whether it s a phone call  setting up a meeting  a recruiting thing  writing a brief  scheduling a car service all of those things are on the list  I take a clean look at it every single day and decide what I m going to accomplish  and I try not to take on too much  It s easy to get overwhelmed and stretched out if you try to take on too much   Facebook has a heavy meeting culture at least I know it does on my team so I try to protect my calendar as much as I can  I ll put in blocks of time so that people can t block me out  If something is important  they ll reach out via email or Messenger and I ll open up a time  I found that helps me stay focused on the things I think I should be focused on  Protecting my calendar has been a very good exercise and productivity boost for me   Managers should look out for the calendars of their team  They need to have good  clean blocks of time to do work  so making sure their meetings are grouped together is key  On Wednesdays we have a work from home or no meetings day here  It s a nice  full workday and that s been positive  But periodically it s important to ask your team how their calendar looks  If it looks like a shotgun blast  that s not a great way to do a lot of good work   What are the tools you use that you re touching on a daily basis   Todoist  Messenger  Facebook Groups  Medium  Face to face communication is the tool I try to use more and more  I m doing a lot more writing now  so Medium is something that I use a lot  Primarily it s communication tools and organizational tools   When you find yourself disconnected from what you find meaningful about your work  how do you get yourself back into that space   It ebbs and flows  There are days where you re just not feeling it  Maybe you haven t really had any wins  or progress feels slow  or the stuff you re testing or putting into market isn t doing as well as you d like it to   I think that now that I ve made some personal changes I ve gotten better at that  I do yoga every day  and I find that gives me some good time in my own head  It s helped me feel less discouraged and keeps me more vibrant and interested  even when things aren t as good as they can be  I also don t keep stuff inside like I used to  I talk to people about it  I have a few people that I trust in my life now and openly communicate with them  Sometimes the act of sharing the things that aren t going as great as you d like with someone else  is helpful   What is the best career advice you ve been given   I think the best advice I ve received was never given it was always learned  I think when people just tell you things  we tend to throw them away too easily  While we may take in the words  they often don t mean much until we ve experienced something   When people say  Time goes by quickly  so make the most of it   or  You can do anything you want if you put your mind to it   it doesn t mean much  Sure  they re overused and vague  but they re actually very true  Sadly  I think 99  of people can t hear them for what they are  because it s too difficult for our brains to comprehend the scale of what they mean   For example  my eldest son Cole turned 15 recently  It was a big moment for me I realized in a year he d be getting his driver s license  It made me think about how quickly it really does go by  Of course  I d heard that phrase a thousand times  but it didn t sink in until the passing of time gave it true meaning   Why do you do what you do  What makes your work so meaningful to you   Over the past year here the team s grown immensely  I think it was 10 or 11 people when I joined  and now it s at 25 or 26  It s really enjoyable to see that growth  Not in size that s definitely one thing but it s more about seeing people grow  Watching them progress through the work that they re doing that you re hopefully guiding them on  That s really enjoyable   I m a product designer at heart  and one of the primary things that I love is shipping products  Putting tests in the market even if they re not doing well is just fascinating and I love it  Facebook has been such a cool place to do that  because you re working at such scale and there s so many talented people here and they re able to push out tests so quickly and with so many iterations  It s fascinating and empowering to understand how quickly you can get real feedback on whether your idea is working   To understand that making something 2 pixels larger has meaningful impact in terms of how people engage with it  that s unreal  It s unbelievable to me the nuance when you re working at a product of this scale  and how the smallest decisions can have such great impact  We never really got to experience it at Teehan Lax to the scale of this even though we worked with some of those companies like Google and Facebook and other large companies  Even though you re partnering up and you re working closely  you re not really as involved over a longer period of time to really understand  Being on the inside now  it s been pretty eye opening   This interview was originally published at Ways We Work   Read more Design Chats,"[609 518 313 1145 782 1316 561 154 1062 985 51]"
610,training-dataset/product/568.txt,product,Intercom s Elizabeth McGuane on crafting a content strategyWords have always been very important to Intercom  This blog  our product marketing  and our books are all testament to that  But equally important are the words within the product itself   the product names  microcopy  labels etc  Elizabeth McGuane  our content strategist has had incredible impact on the language of our product over the past year  so we sat down to discuss when startups should start thinking about content strategy  how to find a consistent tone for your product  and why the rise of bots is bringing language front and center  If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the episode  Short on time  Here are four quick takeaways  Content strategy is as much about internal communication as it is about the final words that the customer sees  When it comes to tone  what feels right for a single experience might not be right for the overall product  Many content strategists work closely with design and engineering  so it s important to be familiar with the tools those teams use  and even be able to make changes directly to the code base  Breaking words down into their basic structural patterns can help guide you when trying to write great interface copy  Not all bots are created equal  Research is showing that we engage with text based interactions very differently than we do with voice ones  which has big implications for how bots are designed  Des Traynor  Elizabeth  welcome to the show  This is going to be all about content strategy  A lot of people are going to be like   Content what    so let s start with what contact strategy is  How do you define it  Elizabeth McGuane  People might confuse it with content marketing  content governance or any of the other  content  disciplines  All those things I would think of as being a part of content strategy  It s a big umbrella that lots of things can fit into  When we practice content strategy at Intercom  we re talking about the foundations of what we re building   the terminology we use  how we define things  the visible words you can see in the products  and how it all fits together  as well as the tone and voice of the product itself  Those are the underlying basics of content strategy that feeds into everywhere else we talk about the product  including marketing  Des  Clearly it s external  because it s what people see and experience with the product  both in terms of the words we use and the tone we speak in  But it also seems like it has an internal purpose as well  Elizabeth  It s the connective tissue between a lot of different disciplines  I spend time talking to engineers about how we re defining our terminology and code  as well as to our analytics team  For example  we recently restructured our event naming  That s the very technical aspect of content strategy  but fundamentally we re talking about the same things  What are things  What are the things we re building  How do we describe them in an effective way  and how do we do it in a way that we understand and that our users will understand  Clearly defining the product Des  If you take Intercom  it s a reasonably broad product  There are a lot of different concepts  from messages to people to companies to automatic messages  The simplicity and consistency of word use matters  Elizabeth  It definitely does  When we started out  there were people in Intercom that cared about content and thought about language in a very careful way  We chose really simple words  The problem for us has been that as the product has expanded  those simple words are applied to different things that don t all mean quite the same thing  Sometimes it feels like I have a list of 25 words and I have to make them fit all these different use cases  A lot of the work we re doing now is getting down to clarity and making sure that the words we re using define what the product does now  and gives it some room to grow as well  Des  What s an example of one of those conflicts  I know we used the word  people  at the beginning  Have we moved to  user   Elizabeth  We call this  the people problem   In our marketing  we talk about people   These are the people you re talking to   We use this a lot in our advertising  and it is really simple conceptually  But when you re trying to purchase a product or use the product  you need a bit more granularity  Am I talking about visitors to a website who aren t logged in  or actual active users  We now have a system  The people who are within Intercom are teammates  because they re all on teams  Then we have customers  or if you want more granularity  we can say end users  visitors  leads  You get progressively more granular depending on the use case  Des  A lot of listeners are early stage startups  or they re small teams within large companies starting something new  At what point should they be applying the content strategy lens  And what s a sign that you ve left it too late  Elizabeth  You ll might realize you ve been doing it anyway  and that it has become something that somebody needs to do full time  You ve already been paying attention to terminology and to structure  to user experience and the language in the user experience  You ve been thinking about it  and it just becomes something you need someone to manage  That s a really good trigger for knowing when content strategy needs to be a job on its own     Or you realize you haven t been thinking about it  Your product is a mess and you re using the same word to mean two different things  People are asking lots of questions about clarity and not understanding the basic system that you have  The right mood and message Des  I presume you ve got crazy variance in tone  from the strict to the casual  Elizabeth  Tonal variants are funny  because you ll find these unusual tones in parts of the product   or in marketing  or in the whole content experience   that you wouldn t expect  You might delve into developer documentation and find emojis running rampant  just because a developer got bored and decided to have a little bit of fun with how they write it  It s a balance between consistency and what feels right for the product  This is particularly true for Intercom  because we re building a product that helps people express themselves  We want something that feels functional  but that allows that expression to happen  There s always a push and pull  You have to make the right choice for that experience  or that part of the experience  Five simple words in an interface can carry a huge weight in a product  Des  What s the content strategist s obvious bug bear  Elizabeth  There are the classic things like terrible dialogues and modals that people don t understand  For example  if I have cancel and close beside each other  and I don t know what to do  There are people out there who are bothered by particular pieces of grammar  There are lots of people who are bothered by things like that  For me  there are two things  One is length  people over explaining something instead of finding the one thing that actually needs to be explained  The second thing is when I see evidence of the org chart being made visible in the whole product experience  When I can tell that marketing and the product are not aligned and I can see there s a strategic problem going on that needs to be resolved  That s one of the things that a content strategist would pick up on  The power of great copy Des  Is it fair to say that you talk a bit about copy  but that s only because it s the most tangible output  Much like designers ultimately create pixels but design is not about pixels  Words are the output but content strategy is not about micro copy  right  Elizabeth  Yes  words are part of the output  internal communication and keeping people aligned is part of the output as is doing system modeling and structural work  The words being part of the output isn t a bad thing  as we see in working on the messenger  Words can be incredibly powerful   five simple words in a messenger interface can carry a huge weight in a product  The design aspect of it is definitely felt in the words that you see  While those are only equivalent to pixels and colors  they are still incredibly important and incredibly valuable  Lesson learned redesigning our messenger Des  The messenger was a ground up re imagination of what it means to talk to people on a website or inside a product  We basically re did everything  When did you come in and what did you work on  Elizabeth  I came in pretty late  It was a couple of months before we launched  but a lot of the design work had been done  Like any project  you re working on it right up until the end  and there s a lot of change and re examination  The PM on that project  Brian Donohue  was incredibly focused on getting it right  I had worked with him previously  at another company  so he brought me right in and we started talking about the concepts behind all of the elements that had been created  We had redesigned certain aspects of the messenger  like profile cards  and even the fields within those profile cards  What is a team profile supposed to be for and how does it feel personal  If we re asking people to introduce themselves  why are we asking them to do that  What should they say  We were trying to be really specific  because the power of great microcopy and great interface copy is being able to tell people exactly what to do  clearly  so they don t have to think about it  It s really easy to design something that looks very beautiful  but you might have pieces of that interface that  even though it s incredibly spare  are still unclear in terms of their motivation   That s where we started  and we worked a lot on how we talked about different parts of the design work  A lot of it was with the engineers and the designers  clarifying what it was we had built  or were building  as we went along  The engineers on that team were fantastic  and they came up with this phrase   same language from code to customer   They wanted to be able to use the same terminology in our code base   for example   team  and  teammate  instead of  admin    and have that appear in the interface as well  There are a lot of people in Intercom who are incredibly focused on detail  Des  Does that mean that for a certain type of in app message  from the Ruby code that models it down to the methods that implement it  to the UI label  all the way to marketing  that it s all the same thing  Elizabeth  Yup  so if a new engineer came in  and they were looking at the code base and wondering   what is this thing    we have something articulated in our design patterns and also visible in the interface and in the way we describe it in the interface  Des  What was the most controversial or difficult part  from a content strategy point of view  of the latest messenger release   Elizabeth  When it launched  I probably would have said that it was this design feature called Borderless  It was really nice way to experience a messaging context without opening a big heavy messenger chrome  We spent a lot of time talking about what we should call it  For me  that felt like the most pressing thing at the time  But since then  it has been the idea of an introduction  If you re asking someone to introduce themselves to their customers  what s the most effective way of doing that  That s the thing we ve iterated the most  and it really comes down to Intercom s mission  What does it mean to be personal  If you re asking someone to introduce themselves to their customers so that their customer can get to know them  what s the effective way of doing that  Do you want them to say   Hey  I m Des and I like surfing on the weekends  or should it be like   Hey  I m Des and I have this role and I can help you in this way   What s the real thing that you want people to do  We re all about being personal and we want people to be able to express themselves  so we re kind of opting for something a bit more free form  That question is almost like Intercom s mission in one field  Des  Are there any words or phrases that cause you particular pain  Anything that makes you think  You know what  this always bites us so let s never use it    Elizabeth   People  is definitely a big one  We get a lot of confused questions about it  because of the way we ve traditionally talked about it  One of the most satisfying things is being able to move that along in new releases  e g  our product store and working with our product growth team on that  That s one of the places where  though the work is founded in the product team and in design work  content strategy has an impact across the organization  Where  are there inconsistencies  or the same word used in multiple ways  Another thing is the tendency to over explain ourselves  We have a really complicated product that does lots of different things  Sometimes we re so enmeshed in it ourselves   and I think any product team would experience this as well   we forget we don t have to literally explain every single step of how it works  we just have to take you to the next step  Des  At one of your conference talks recently  you discussed the word  soon  and how every time you include it in the UI you think   This is probably not going to work   Elizabeth  Yeah  we did user testing of the word  soon   It s the most dangerous word in the English language for us  People  when they hear  soon   they think it means either right away or never  If we say   they ll reply to you soon  people interpret it as either  This interface is lying to me and nobody s ever going to reply to my message  or some think it means right away  It s about how people interpret really simple words  A lot of the most interesting work that I ve been able to do has been working with the messenger team to get those five word strings of text exactly right  and then iterate on them  Content strategy toolkit Des  For projects like these  UX designers have their wire frames  and engineers have their software  What tools does a content strategist use  Elizabeth  It depends on the task at hand  When I first started  in order to understand the lay of the land I did a product taxonomy  which is essentially an audit of literally every word that we have on the product  It wasn t just a long  flat list  as it involved asking  what is this thing and how do I categorize it  and how does it relate to these other things  Where are there inconsistencies  or the same word used in multiple ways  I also produced a glossary  The next step was a public glossary of the terms that we have  This is part of keeping us honest  making sure we stick to the terminology we want our customers to use  That was a really interesting process of collaborating with people across the organization to define all of these different parts of the product  I still do that for new products that are released  I work on the product glossary that will go out to our communications and marketing teams  so they ll understand exactly what we mean when we say x word  But in my day to day  I work really closely with the design team  so lot of times I m working directly in Sketch  While everything should be content first and you should design around the content  it s more of a back and forth  That s the most fun and interesting way to do it  Des  After it s live  when you decide to make changes  do you make those directly or do you put in a request  Elizabeth  A combination  When I started I was making requests  but that s an incredible load on our developers  Now I have a development environment and I can make changes directly to the code  as can all our designers  With a little bit of training we were able to do that   We also use GitHub for resolving issues  though there s a point where it breaks  and you re trying to look at a whole system of terminology  Des  We have a pretty extensive design pattern library  and the rule there is if something here will do the job  use it  and to think very carefully before adding to it  Is it similar with your glossary  Elizabeth  It definitely is  Say we have a word for people  like  teammate   we shouldn t necessarily come up with different words to describe people in a different way just because we re talking about the product in a slightly different way  That can be tough  because we work in lots of different areas  We have support contexts  and marketing contexts  In the public domain there are lots of different terms used to describe people and different types of ways of describing customers  We have to stick to our system wide definition unless we have a really strong reason not to  Des  Without defaming your colleagues  is it a problem that when we re creating something new  everyone thinks that everything should be new  I certainly see it on the UI side  Elizabeth  There s a little bit of that  A lot of it is breaking it down structurally  People look at words and they think every new sentence is a brand new sentence  completely crafted  never been heard before  Actually  if you look at the patterns behind the sentences   the verb structures  how we use pronouns   all of those things have to follow a pattern  and often for really specific reasons  For example  we couldn t use a non gendered pronoun in our messenger  We can t use gendered pronouns because we don t ask your gender when you sign up to Intercom  like Facebook would  But we can t use a non gender pronoun because it doesn t translate well  There are different technical and specific considerations that give you a lot of guidelines and constraints that focus the way you can express things  A lot of it is also like design itself  I feel completely supported in saying that we shouldn t use x pattern or y pattern because the content purpose isn t best served by that  It might look better  but it isn t necessarily the right reason to use it  In that context I would see as more of a design decision  as opposed to it just being the words themselves  Conversational design is bigger than bots Des  We re seeing the rise of conversational commerce  conversational interfaces  or bots  These are bubbles going back and forth  and there is no UI  or very limited UI  That s puts a heavy emphasis on the words  I presume that s good news for a content strategist  because finally people have to play in your world  What are the key things people need to think about  from a content perspective  if they re designing a chat based product  Elizabeth  I gave a talk at Confab recently which really focused on bots and what we had learned about bots from some experimentation we had done earlier this year  One of the things that s important but not considered is the role of personification  We have this default  maybe from science fiction  that robots have personality  so we say  what are you going to call your bot  That is completely jumping to the conclusion that it has to have a name or a personality  What we ve realized in testing is that in the wrong context that can fail and be frustrating and annoying for people  Des  Is that because it s trying to be goofy and playful all the time when it s not useful  Elizabeth  Not even  We ve even found just having a first person pronoun and name is frustrating  because it s a cognitive barrier  It s different if you download an app that you know is going to be a bot  But if you want to talk to a human being or download something  or you re using something  and then then this bot pops up and you don t expect it  There s also the whole sequential aspect  In conversational UI in general  and bots more specifically  it can take a lot longer to get something done  It can be really quick if you know exactly what to say  or if it s structured in the right way  With bots we re almost back in the days when search didn t work well and we had to figure out how to search for something effectively  It s like that with badly made bots  you have figure out how to talk to the bot to get the answer you want  which should not be what we want to do  Des  The funny thing is that in the beginning  as Neal Stephenson once wrote  there was the command line  and the idea of an interface where you could type a limited number of commands in and it would react based on whether or not you got the syntax right  We ve reinvented that and put chat bubbles around it  and now everyone thinks the internet s going to change fundamentally  Elizabeth  And bots themselves are a huge landscape with lots of differences  I read some interesting research that said when you hear a voice  like with Siri or Alexa or any kind of voice operated bot  you re far more likely to trust it and to accept it as a person or an anthropomorphic thing  than you are if you read text  With text you disassociate from it completely  which explains why a lot of people s internet comments are so terrible  There are all these different psychological things going on  and that s so interesting  It s an incredible place to be in and to get to think about  and it s a great justification that everything comes back to the words eventually  Des  The most interesting thing that occurs to me is that we re reinventing UI inside a chat window  Take Facebook  A lot of their popular bots  like 1 800 Flowers  fall back to a restricted set of commands whenever they can  Knowing Facebook  I m sure that that s for the right reason  for what performs a lot  I presume that s mostly a challenge of natural language processing  There s a million ways to say   I want flowers   But there s only one way to click the flowers icon that s beside the chocolates icon,"[610 529 680

anyone with an openness and humor that makes them magnetic   So it won t surprise you that Chang  who ran product for Google Analytics before founding data driven networking startup Accompany in 2013  counts dozens of luminaries among her advisors   including best selling authors like Chip Heath and Nir Eyal  Fielding this type of expertise seems like a nearly impossible feat  but her only secret is this  She spent years figuring out how to methodically build her network   and is the first to admit she feels the same nervousness  intimidation and doubt that any first time founder feels when asking seasoned professionals for help   Through both wins and losses in this arena  she forged new emotional intelligence and muscles that have enabled her to surround herself with the best thinking across marketing  data  engineering  and more  Here  she shares hard won lessons from her vast experience for founders and individuals alike who are looking for a different caliber of advice   Create Categories  Advising is not one size fits all  Different people will be capable of different time and energy commitments  So  the first thing you should do is create categories of advisors that allow for this variability  For instance at Accompany  Chang has what she calls  light touch advisors  and  board advisors   they re not on the board  it s just meant to signify deep involvement    Light touch advisors have no regular obligations  Chang simply wants to reserve the right to call them and have a 30 minute conversation a few times a year when an issue in their wheelhouse pops up  Board advisors  on the other hand  are intimately familiar with all aspects of the company  get regular updates  and are on call to help sort through critical decisions   Having these two buckets has given Chang a lot more latitude to get incredibly talented yet busy people involved  She can assess what s appropriate  and can ask for their time accordingly  She s also able to set clear and reasonable expectations from the beginning  While she has under 5 board advisors  this model gives her access to the minds of 30  other incredible operators for one off questions   This system also lets her label everyone involved as an advisor regardless of whether they re advising on just one area or on ten  Giving the title of  advisor  communicates just how much Chang values their time and advice  which in turn strengthens the connection   Light Touch Advisors  You want a circle of area experts who you can call to quickly get help solving specific problems  says Chang   Keep the lift low for them   she says   When you ask them to advise  tell them that this will mean pinging them a few times a year  and it will only and always be about something they know more about than nearly anyone else on earth    Light touch advisors help on an ad hoc basis  For example  when Accompany s staff wants a second pair of eyes or a gut check on a new feature  they might pull in Slack VP Product April Underwood  Dan Ariely was able to offer a better welcome flow for the app  drawing on several behavioral truths he s been researching for years   These are people who ve seen the movie enough times to know how it will end  It s very easy for them to tell us what will happen when we take specific actions  what we should watch out for  how to do things better   she says    All you re asking for here is 20 minutes   Chang says   If someone was jazzed enough about you to say yes to being any kind of advisor  they ll say yes to 20 minutes  And most of the time you ll learn more than you could have in a year because that person knows so much more than you and is able to pattern match based on a wealth of experience    Being a founder is perpetually needing more expertise than you could ever possibly accrue as an individual  This is the way to get close   In addition to bestowing the  advisor  title  Chang strongly recommends granting these people a small  courtesy amount of equity  It s a professional way to say thank you while acknowledging their vested interest in your success   If you start noticing that some of these light touch contacts becoming indispensable  especially at pivotal moments  don t wait for them to bring it up  Ask them if they want to take on a larger advising role  and match it with a larger stake in the company   Board Advisors  a k a  Senior Advisors  Lead Advisors   the title is up to you    Lorrie Norrington is Chang s first call whenever she s wrestling with a big decision  She s one of Accompany s three board advisors  and exemplifies who you want in this type of position    Board advisors have enough context about the entire team and the status of the company to weigh in meaningfully on any decision  But at the same time  they re the people you should be able to most open up to and be vulnerable with   she says   Chang met Norrington incidentally at Stanford s Director Consortium  They struck up a conversation after a session and talked all the way through the break  Now she relies on her for completely unvarnished opinions on the thorniest questions she encounters    The reason it works so well is that I know with 100  certainty that nothing I tell her will change the way she thinks about me   even if I don t follow her advice   says Chang   This level of psychological safety is non optional for a successful close advising relationship  she says  It stems from trusting that even the toughest  most unflinching criticism isn t personal   it s about helping the company succeed  When choosing advisors  look for people whose style of delivery never makes you feel judged    When we raised our series B  when we decided to build our own data platform   there have been many inflection points where the answers were not even close to black or white   Chang says   Each of those times  I pinged three of our most insightful and incisive board advisors  They pushed and refined my thinking    Deciding to build Accompany s own proprietary data platform was a high stakes undertaking  It was going to be expensive  hard  long  slogging work that would demand even more funding  and Chang wasn t sure it was the right call  That is  until Norrington and fellow board advisors Kevin Compton and Dave Goldberg told her  unequivocally  how vital it would be long term    It was really scary   she says   I had to be able to lean on them pretty hard   So when you re looking for your  board advisors   keep this anecdote in mind  Who do you want in your corner  knowing they ll see you during some of the most draining  defeating  terrifying moments of your career  If you don t want someone to see you that way  they aren t right for the job   Maximize Potential Connections   You have to be willing to meet hundreds of people every single year of your career   says Chang   Maybe you ll have chemistry with 10  where you want to spend more time with them and they want to spend more time with you   Building your network is not an extracurricular  It takes hard  intentional work  She still carves out time to meet with at least two new people a week    When I started out  I would ask the people I knew who their best and brightest contacts were for X   where X was maybe sales or software engineering  Then I d ask for intros   she says   I met and met and met and met people  If I felt chemistry  I followed up  If we ran out of things to talk about after talking one or two times  I didn t pursue  If there was more density  I took note    90  of starting a company is execution  and that definitely applies to advising relationships  she says  You have to do the work to cultivate relationships  which means allocating time to support others toward their goals  Make it clear you ll be there  not just in spirit  but immediately and concretely  if there s ever anything you can help with   If you re just starting out today  don t worry  You know people  Start asking them who they know and build outward in concentric circles  says Chang   Whenever someone says to you   You should really talk to person X about Y   don t let it go by  Write it down  Follow up and make it happen  Lots of people forget about intros they ve been offered and will never know what could have happened  You can meet someone who will change your life anywhere    Finding the right advisors comes down to chemistry  and that can only be tested face to face   Be ambitious  and don t sell yourself short by assuming someone won t talk to you  Chang  for instance  likes to reach out to the authors of business books she likes  That s how she met Heath  She read Made to Stick  found a common connection  and asked for an intro  Of course she didn t ask him to advise right away  she simply asked for 10 minutes of his time to chat about his work  Since then  he s helped Accompany rethink its brand messaging    Authors have fantastic domain expertise and they love talking to people who have been affected by their writing   she says   So  think creatively about the pieces you already have in place  Who are the top three people who pop into your brain when you think  growth  or  sales  or  SEO   Find mutual connections if you can  Now ask your existing contacts the same questions  Who do they think of  Would they feel comfortable making an intro    Events are great for networking  but they can also be a waste of time  Despite her social savvy  Chang still gets nervous when she finds herself at a reception where she knows no one  When this happens  she gives herself a pass instead of stressing out about making conversation  Instead  she advises carefully choosing events where you ll have a way in    Make sure you re familiar with at least 10  of the folks who will likely be there   she says   That ll give you the foothold to productively meet a lot of other people  Your existing contacts can help break the ice and establish your credibility    Redefine the Word  Chemistry    Lorrie has kicked my ass so many times  She pushes me to the edge of the yellow zone and I love her for it   says Chang   Soon after launch  when the last thing we were thinking about was expanding to yet another platform  Lorrie was the person who said   This information has to be in my inbox  you need an app for Gmail    So the team jammed on the idea and were able to get a product out the door within two weeks   Feeling chemistry with a prospective advisor doesn t mean feeling total synchronicity or agreement  It s not the same as feeling like someone  really gets you  or  finally understands   Instead  you want someone who lights you up intellectually  says things that make you want to ask questions  and isn t afraid to make controversial statements about what you or your company are doing  Chemistry is when someone is more interested in ensuring the best for your company than tiptoeing around your ego   How can you spot this in a first conversation   Maybe they ask you questions about the future that feel a bit uncomfortable   Maybe they introduce other possibilities or markets or challenges in the conversation   Maybe they ask how you plan to accomplish key milestones   Maybe they display curiosity in how you plan to do what you re saying and run an unsolicited stress test of your ideas and arguments    In a close advisor  you want someone who will ask you the really gut wrenching questions before your board inevitably asks them   says Chang   I know I can be completely vulnerable with Lorrie in a way I can t be with almost anyone else because she s operating with a different purpose    Norrington s tough questioning is the best preparation for board meetings  but it s not soft or forgiving  Too many entrepreneurs ring themselves with advisors who feed their confirmation bias  or who won t risk upsetting them  even if that s exactly the push they need   Here s a good indication of a great advisor  Every time you walk away or hang up the phone  you feel like you need to spend more time with them   This is why it s so important to test the depth of someone s knowledge over a couple meetings before you ask them to officially advise you  There should be more than enough material to fill a few coffee dates  And their wisdom should ideally manifest in forcing you to do most of the thinking and talking   Next Steps  Turning an initial meeting into an advising relationship is where the bulk of EQ is needed  Of course  don t just plunge in and ask immediately  There s no way to even know if you re a match  But something must come before asking for that initial coffee too   If you ve had a great conversation at an event  or you ve been introduced to someone by a mutual contact  send a follow up email to ask for a short phone call  Very few people will turn down a 20 minute conversation  especially if you re specific about what you want to discuss  They won t want to  just chat    they ll want to know what value you re looking to get from them  so don t be shy about it   One call is enough to see if there s enough mutual interest and content to keep talking  If yes  ask for lunch or coffee in the next two weeks to keep things going  If it goes well but you re not sure the person is fully bought into what you re working on  don t abandon the connection    I ll wait for a relevant article to pop up about the person on Accompany  or about something that might interest them  and I ll send it along with a congrats or ask how they re doing   says Chang   If I spot an opportunity to be helpful  like an intro to a potential board member or backchanneling a candidate they re interested in  I ll volunteer   She sees every communication as a chance to show why she and Accompany are worth their time   Make it clear you re about mutual benefit  You re not just asking for their help  You re dedicated to helping them as well   Put your best foot forward  Only make double opt in introductions  and read over your emails before sending  Polish and etiquette matter more than you think  If someone seems increasingly interested or grateful for your assistance  that s when to ask for an in person meeting   Here s what you should be looking for in meetings and correspondence   Is the person responsive to you  Even if they re not wildly enthusiastic about your ideas  do they get back to you relatively quickly   Do they ask questions to get more context about what you re doing  Are they curious to understand the big picture   Do they seem judgmental in an unproductive way  In casual conversation  do they gossip or unconstructively criticize other people or companies  If so  they ll make you feel judged too   Are they proactive about finding ways to help you  Do they suggest other people you should meet or ideas to consider without you asking   Would this person be more helpful at a different stage of your company  If so  keep them in mind  Do they know anyone else they d recommend you speak to   Does the person s network overlap a lot with yours  Too much  Can they open enough doors to people and fields you have no contact with already   Making the Ask  Asking someone to advise your company is like asking someone on a first date  Nerves  butterflies   even some light panic   is totally normal  Here s how Chang s navigated it successfully in the past   1  Start with a question  Ease into the topic by asking if the person currently advises companies  If so  do they do more informal  lighter touch advising  See if they respond positively  They ll know where you re leading  but you won t have to put yourself out there right away  If they say no  you can let it go   no harm  no foul   2  When you do ask  be clear  Don t try to find other words or talk around what you want  Say straight out  I think you d be an incredible advisor for our company   3  Quickly talk scope of commitment  Before you pause or let them talk  set clear expectations around time investment  If you re asking for a lower lift engagement  say specifically that it will be 20 minutes every other month on an ad hoc basis   I tell people   You have world class knowledge in this domain  I would love to be able to consult you when relevant things come up    says Chang   People are much more likely to say yes if they feel like you get it   you get that they re busy  you have the EQ to know what s reasonable to ask for    4  Be patient  Wait for their answer  Don t talk over them or interrupt  You might feel the urge to counter any objection or argument  Don t  React slowly and give yourself enough time to think   5  Respond with enthusiasm  If you get a yes  immediately show gratitude and explain how thrilled you will be to build alongside them  If it s a no  show empathy for their reasoning  They ll remember how you behaved in that moment   Remember  you re asking for their most valuable resource  Don t propose it if you don t feel like the person really wants to see you and your company win  If you don t know for sure that they do  it s too early to be asking at all  You have more work to do relaying your passion for the idea   I never knew how important storytelling was until I became an entrepreneur  Success in these conversations is all about the energy of the connection  Smile  Be excited  It matters   Keeping Relationships Strong  Advisory relationships tend to be so qualitative  it s hard to define metrics for success  The best indications of a healthy connection for Chang are  1  whether or not an advisor is responsive to the company s needs on a regular basis  and 2  whether you feel like you  quantum leap  your knowledge on a topic whenever you speak to the person   As an entrepreneur  there are several actions you can take to boost these metrics   Know what it means to follow up  This is the most important thing you can do  Whatever advice someone gives you  tell them how it was considered  acted on or applied  and what happened as a result   The thing people like Lorrie and Chip care most about is whether their time yielded impact   says Chang  She keeps a running document of one liner ideas contributed by advisors and makes a point of revisiting every six months so she can follow up   Send regular updates  It s critical to stay top of mind  Chang sends short email updates to all of Accompany s advisors periodically  talking through new features and providing commentary on recent decisions   Usually I get replies from  40  of them every time   she says   It s a great way to solidify contact  And they often supply a ton of good input unsolicited    Circulate low lift tasks  You can keep people feeling engaged by sending out very quick tasks to help the company  For example  when Accompany was about to launch notifications  they wanted to know if the feature felt helpful or spammy  They sent a quick note to advisors asking them to test it out and share their thoughts   We ended up making our notifications much more specific as a result   Chang says   Make asks that match the person  Everyone has regular preferences and behaviors  Some people like to tweet a lot  Others would rather speak at events  Know what type of request would fit with what they love or feel natural doing   We think about how our advisors choose to express themselves  their style of writing  what types of things they usually share  the channels they share on   says Chang   It s worth it to be nuanced  Document it  Before a launch  I ll sit with our marketing team and run through our advisors  pointing out who makes sense to ask for what kind of support  and who wouldn t feel comfortable    Bring them into the team  Don t keep the relationship unilateral  Invite an advisor in to speak informally with your team   it s a nice way to introduce them to everyone  Host a dinner for them with the team around a big question the company is wrestling with  It will cut out the small talk  If an advisor seems suited to it  ask them to mentor one of your star players  It will make them feel helpful and benefit someone you might not have time to train and develop yourself   Don t hold back  You re only hurting yourself if you re not 100  vulnerable and transparent with your closest advisors  This includes being honest about your emotions  Seasoned professionals make the best advisors because   like therapists   they ve seen everything  They ve seen people get upset  angry  sad  scared  and they re equipped to deal with it   Give your close advisors a chance to help you with not just the issue  but your psychology around the issue too   says Chang   It s an incredible relief    Express constant and continual gratitude  This is critical   Your advisors are in no way obligated to help you  They want to know their time is being well spent   she says  Letting them know specifically where and how they had impact on the product  the team  on you is essential   As with any skill you learn as an entrepreneur  you need to practice to build the right muscles  EQ is too often considered an innate quality that you either have or don t  That s not the case  The biggest mistake people make when it comes to finding advisors is not being proactive enough   they don t meet enough people  or follow up fast enough  or take enough meetings to make sure it s truly a match  If you put in the time  you ll develop the pattern matching and the instincts will follow   And don t worry about being nervous  Everyone is  Even the people you re asking for help get nervous sometimes  That same humanity allows you to project authentic passion that will make the right people want to work with you   Photography courtesy of Accompany,"[612 1316 721 154 284 863 51 561 1145 105 667]"
628,training-dataset/business/1315.txt,business,The Greatest Sales Deck I ve Ever Seen   The Mission   MediumThe Greatest Sales Deck I ve Ever Seen  It s Zuora s  and it s brilliant  Here s why   A few months ago  my friend Tim took a new sales job at a Series C tech company that had raised over  60 million from A list investors  He s one of the best salespeople I know  but soon after starting  he emailed me to say he was struggling    I ve landed a few small accounts   Tim said   But my pitch falls flat at big enterprises    As I ve written before  I love helping teams craft the high level strategic story that powers sales  marketing  fundraising   everything  So Tim and I met for lunch at the Amber India restaurant off San Francisco s Market Street to review his deck   After loading up on the all you can eat buffet  I asked Tim   At what point do prospects tune out     Usually a few slides in   he said   Intent on maximizing dining ROI  Tim went back to the buffet for seconds  When he returned  I pulled out my laptop and launched into a Powerpoint presentation    What s this   Tim asked    This   I said   is the greatest sales deck I have ever seen    The 5 Elements of a Brilliant Sales Narrative  The sales deck I showed Tim came from Zuora  the IPO bound Silicon Valley company that sells a SaaS platform for subscription billing  If you pay for anything on a recurring basis  e g  enterprise software   there s a good chance that Zuora facilitates those transactions   I had received the deck from an ex Zuora salesperson  who said it helped him close the biggest deals of his career   I have no connection to Zuora  and no relationship with anyone who currently works there  UPDATE  Some current Zuora employees have connected with me after reading this    Abandoning his naan in a puddle of curried goat  Tim grabbed pen and paper and took notes as we ran through what made the Zuora deck so effective   Specifically  we noted how brilliantly the deck led prospects through the following five elements  in precisely this order    The ex Zuora salesperson asked that I not share the Zuora deck publicly  and I will honor that request  However  I found slides on Zuora s website and SlideShare channel that exhibit nearly the same narrative flow  all of the images below come from those public sources     1  Name a Big  Relevant Change in the World  Don t kick off a sales presentation by talking about your product  your headquarters locations  your investors  your clients  or anything about yourself   Instead  name the undeniable shift in the world that creates both  a  big stakes and  b  huge urgency for your prospect   The first slide of virtually every Zuora deck   sales or otherwise   is some version of this   Zuora came up with the phrase  subscription economy  to name the trend in which buyers increasingly choose recurring service payments over outright purchases  Zuora usually follows that with a slide laying out the history of the change   Note the subtle but important difference from what most pitch advice tells you  which is to start with  the problem   When you assert that your prospects have a problem  you put them on the defensive  They may be unaware of the problem  or uncomfortable admitting they suffer from it   But when you highlight a shift in the world  you get prospects to open up about how that shift affects them  how it scares them  and where they see opportunities  Most importantly  you grab their attention  As Hollywood screenwriting guru Robert McKee says    what attracts human attention is change   if the temperature around you changes  if the phone rings   that gets your attention  The way in which a story begins is a starting event that creates a moment of change    2  Show There ll Be Winners and Losers  All prospects suffer from what economists call  loss aversion   That is  they tend to avoid a possible loss by sticking to the status quo  rather than risk a possible gain by opting for change   To combat loss aversion  you must demonstrate how the change you cited above will create big winners and big losers  In other words  you have to show both of the following   That adapting to the change you cited will likely result in a highly positive future for the prospect  and That not doing so will likely result in an unacceptably negative future for the prospect  Zuora neatly accomplishes this by documenting a  mass extinction  among Fortune 500 companies    and then showing how the  winners  have shifted from product ownership to subscription services  Those include upstarts    as well as rejuvenated incumbents   To bring the point home  Zuora asks the following   Of course  by this point the common thread is already well established in prospects  minds  Winners adopt the subscription service models that Zuora supports    3  Tease the Promised Land  It s tempting at this point to jump into the details of your product or service  Resist that urge   If you introduce product service details too soon  prospects won t yet have enough context for why those details are important  and they ll tune out   Instead  first present a  teaser  vision of the happily ever after that your product service will help the prospect achieve what I call the Promised Land   Your Promised Land should be both desirable  obviously  and difficult for the prospect to achieve without outside help  Otherwise  why does your company exist   After demonstrating that the subscription economy will result in winners and losers  Zuora presents this Promised Land slide  which offers concrete criteria for what it means to win in the subscription economy   Note that the Promised Land is a new future state  not your product or service    Over lunch  I asked my friend Tim to articulate his Promised Land  and he said   You ll have the most innovative platform for ____   Nope  the Promised Land is not having your technology  but what life is like thanks to having your technology    Your Promised Land is also crucial for helping prospects pitch your solution to colleagues after your sales meeting ends  In your absence  those colleagues will ask   What do those guys do again   Armed with a compelling Promised Land  your prospects are more likely to supply an answer that gets others on board    4  Introduce Features as  Magic Gifts  for Overcoming Obstacles to the Promised Land  If it s not clear by now  successful sales decks follow the same narrative structure as epic films and fairy tales  Your prospect is Luke  and you re Obi Wan  furnishing a lightsaber to help him defeat the Empire  Your prospect is Frodo  and you re Gandalf  wielding wizardry to help him destroy the ring  Your prospect is Cinderella  and you re the fairy godmother  casting spells to get her to the ball   When you introduce your product or service  do so by positioning its capabilities like the lightsaber  wizardry and spells as  magic gifts  for helping your main character  prospect  reach that much desired Promised Land   For example  above is the slide where Zuora talks about the structure of its customer record  Out of context  this detail would likely bore even the most technical prospect   Positioned in the context of transitioning from an  old world  to a  new world   however  it s the foundation for an engaging conversation with prospects technical and otherwise about why it s so hard to reach the Promised Land with traditional solutions    5  Present Evidence that You Can Make the Story Come True  In telling the sales narrative this way  you re making a commitment to prospects  If they go with you  you ll get them to the Promised Land   But the road to the Promised Land is  by definition  littered with obstacles  so prospects are rightly skeptical of your ability to deliver  The last piece of the pitch  then  is the best evidence you can offer that you can make the story you re telling come true   By far  the most effective type of evidence is a success story about how you ve already helped someone else  who is similar to the prospect  reach the Promised Land  Zuora has a set of customer success stories that sales reps draw on  and while they re more elaborate in the actual deck  this testimonial captures the essence   I also like this one  from an exec at NCR  a Zuora customer   which speaks more explicitly to Zuora s stated Promised Land   What if you don t yet have a huge number of successful customers  Product demos are the next most effective evidence  but again  features should always be presented in the context of how they help a prospect reach the Promised Land   A Sales Narrative Works Best When Everyone Tells It  Of course  successful sales rarely happen solely as the result of a great deck  In order for salespeople to be successful  the entire organization must align around the narrative about change  Promised Land  and Magic Gifts   There s no better example of that than Zuora  If you ever see a Zuora executive speak including CEO Tien Tzuo you ll almost certainly hear about the subscription economy and the winners and losers it s creating  In fact  that s the theme of virtually all the company s marketing communications and campaigns  as well as its public vision statement   According to the ex Zuora salesperson  this company wide alignment around the story made him wildly successful   The Zuora marketing folks ran campaigns and branding around this shift to the subscription economy  and  CEO  Tien  Tzuo  talked it up all the time  All of that was like air cover for my in person sales ground attack  By the time I arrived  prospects were already convinced they had to act  It was the closest thing I ve ever experienced to sales nirvana   Biggest Deal Ever  Just three weeks after our lunch  Tim called to say he was seeing promising changes in how prospects at large enterprises were reacting to his new deck  which we drafted together based on Zuora s template  For one thing  prospects opened up much faster about the challenges they were facing  Also  he said the new pitch was more effective at engaging CFOs and other senior gatekeepers   Then  a week after that  Tim emailed with even better news  He had just signed the largest deal in his company s history   Next week  we re headed back to Amber India to celebrate,"[628 775 191 788 872 522 553 288 792 868

632,training-dataset/engineering/597.txt,engineering,Building Jarvis My personal challenge for 2016 was to build a simple AI to run my home    like Jarvis in Iron Man   My goal was to learn about the state of artificial intelligence    where we re further along than people realize and where we re still a long ways off  These challenges always lead me to learn more than I expected  and this one also gave me a better sense of all the internal technology Facebook engineers get to use  as well as a thorough overview of home automation   So far this year  I ve built a simple AI that I can talk to on my phone and computer  that can control my home  including lights  temperature  appliances  music and security  that learns my tastes and patterns  that can learn new words and concepts  and that can even entertain Max  It uses several artificial intelligence techniques  including natural language processing  speech recognition  face recognition  and reinforcement learning  written in Python  PHP and Objective C  In this note  I ll explain what I built and what I learned along the way   Diagram of the systems connected to build Jarvis   Getting Started  Connecting the Home  In some ways  this challenge was easier than I expected  In fact  my running challenge  I also set out to run 365 miles in 2016  took more total time  But one aspect that was much more complicated than I expected was simply connecting and communicating with all of the different systems in my home   Before I could build any AI  I first needed to write code to connect these systems  which all speak different languages and protocols  We use a Crestron system with our lights  thermostat and doors  a Sonos system with Spotify for music  a Samsung TV  a Nest cam for Max  and of course my work is connected to Facebook s systems  I had to reverse engineer APIs for some of these to even get to the point where I could issue a command from my computer to turn the lights on or get a song to play   Further  most appliances aren t even connected to the internet yet  It s possible to control some of these using internet connected power switches that let you turn the power on and off remotely  But often that isn t enough  For example  one thing I learned is it s hard to find a toaster that will let you push the bread down while it s powered off so you can automatically start toasting when the power goes on  I ended up finding an old toaster from the 1950s and rigging it up with a connected switch  Similarly  I found that connecting a food dispenser for Beast or a grey t shirt cannon would require hardware modifications to work   For assistants like Jarvis to be able to control everything in homes for more people  we need more devices to be connected and the industry needs to develop common APIs and standards for the devices to talk to each other   An example natural language request from command line   Natural Language  Once I wrote the code so my computer could control my home  the next step was making it so I could talk to my computer and home the way I d talk to anyone else  This was a two step process  first I made it so I could communicate using text messages  and later I added the ability to speak and have it translate my speech into text for it to read   It started simple by looking for keywords  like  bedroom    lights   and  on  to determine I was telling it to turn the lights on in the bedroom  It quickly became clear that it needed to learn synonyms  like that  family room  and  living room  mean the same thing in our home  This meant building a way to teach it new words and concepts   Understanding context is important for any AI  For example  when I tell it to turn the AC up in  my office   that means something completely different from when Priscilla tells it the exact same thing  That one caused some issues  Or  for example  when you ask it to make the lights dimmer or to play a song without specifying a room  it needs to know where you are or it might end up blasting music in Max s room when we really need her to take a nap  Whoops   Music is a more interesting and complex domain for natural language because there are too many artists  songs and albums for a keyword system to handle  The range of things you can ask it is also much greater  Lights can only be turned up or down  but when you say  play X   even subtle variations can mean many different things  Consider these requests related to Adele   play someone like you    play someone like adele   and  play some adele   Those sound similar  but each is a completely different category of request  The first plays a specific song  the second recommends an artist  and the third creates a playlist of Adele s best songs  Through a system of positive and negative feedback  an AI can learn these differences   The more context an AI has  the better it can handle open ended requests  At this point  I mostly just ask Jarvis to  play me some music  and by looking at my past listening patterns  it mostly nails something I d want to hear  If it gets the mood wrong  I can just tell it  for example   that s not light  play something light   and it can both learn the classification for that song and adjust immediately  It also knows whether I m talking to it or Priscilla is  so it can make recommendations based on what we each listen to  In general  I ve found we use these more open ended requests more frequently than more specific asks  No commercial products I know of do this today  and this seems like a big opportunity   Jarvis uses face recognition to let my friends in automatically and let me know   Vision and Face Recognition  About one third of the human brain is dedicated to vision  and there are many important AI problems related to understanding what is happening in images and videos  These problems include tracking  eg is Max awake and moving around in her crib    object recognition  eg is that Beast or a rug in that room    and face recognition  eg who is at the door     Face recognition is a particularly difficult version of object recognition because most people look relatively similar compared to telling apart two random objects    for example  a sandwich and a house  But Facebook has gotten very good at face recognition for identifying when your friends are in your photos  That expertise is also useful when your friends are at your door and your AI needs to determine whether to let them in   To do this  I installed a few cameras at my door that can capture images from all angles  AI systems today cannot identify people from the back of their heads  so having a few angles ensures we see the person s face  I built a simple server that continuously watches the cameras and runs a two step process  first  it runs face detection to see if any person has come into view  and second  if it finds a face  then it runs face recognition to identify who the person is  Once it identifies the person  it checks a list to confirm I m expecting that person  and if I am then it will let them in and tell me they re here   This type of visual AI system is useful for a number of things  including knowing when Max is awake so it can start playing music or a Mandarin lesson  or solving the context problem of knowing which room in the house we re in so the AI can correctly respond to context free requests like  turn the lights on  without providing a location  Like most aspects of this AI  vision is most useful when it informs a broader model of the world  connected with other abilities like knowing who your friends are and how to open the door when they re here  The more context the system has  the smarter is gets overall   I can text Jarvis from anywhere using a Messenger bot   Messenger Bot  I programmed Jarvis on my computer  but in order to be useful I wanted to be able to communicate with it from anywhere I happened to be  That meant the communication had to happen through my phone  not a device placed in my home   I started off building a Messenger bot to communicate with Jarvis because it was so much easier than building a separate app  Messenger has a simple framework for building bots  and it automatically handles many things for you    working across both iOS and Android  supporting text  image and audio content  reliably delivering push notifications  managing identity and permissions for different people  and more  You can learn about the bot framework at messenger com platform  I can text anything to my Jarvis bot  and it will instantly be relayed to my Jarvis server and processed  I can also send audio clips and the server can translate them into text and then execute those commands  In the middle of the day  if someone arrives at my home  Jarvis can text me an image and tell me who s there  or it can text me when I need to go do something   One thing that surprised me about my communication with Jarvis is that when I have the choice of either speaking or texting  I text much more than I would have expected  This is for a number of reasons  but mostly it feels less disturbing to people around me  If I m doing something that relates to them  like playing music for all of us  then speaking feels fine  but most of the time text feels more appropriate  Similarly  when Jarvis communicates with me  I d much rather receive that over text message than voice  That s because voice can be disruptive and text gives you more control of when you want to look at it  Even when I speak to Jarvis  if I m using my phone  I often prefer it to text or display its response   This preference for text communication over voice communication fits a pattern we re seeing with Messenger and WhatsApp overall  where the volume of text messaging around the world is growing much faster than the volume of voice communication  This suggests that future AI products cannot be solely focused on voice and will need a private messaging interface as well  Once you re enabling private messaging  it s much better to use a platform like Messenger than to build a new app from scratch  I have always been optimistic about AI bots  but my experience with Jarvis has made me even more optimistic that we ll all communicate with bots like Jarvis in the future   Jarvis uses speech recognition in my iOS app to listen to my request for a fresh t shirt   Voice and Speech Recognition  Even though I think text will be more important for communicating with AIs than people realize  I still think voice will play a very important role too  The most useful aspect of voice is that it s very fast  You don t need to take out your phone  open an app  and start typing    you just speak   To enable voice for Jarvis  I needed to build a dedicated Jarvis app that could listen continuously to what I say  The Messenger bot is great for many things  but the friction for using speech is way too much  My dedicated Jarvis app lets me put my phone on a desk and just have it listen  I could also put a number of phones with the Jarvis app around my home so I could talk to Jarvis in any room  That seems similar to Amazon s vision with Echo  but in my experience  it s surprising how frequently I want to communicate with Jarvis when I m not home  so having the phone be the primary interface rather than a home device seems critical   I built the first version of the Jarvis app for iOS and I plan to build an Android version soon too  I hadn t built an iOS app since 2012 and one of my main observations is that the toolchain we ve built at Facebook since then for developing these apps and for doing speech recognition is very impressive   Speech recognition systems have improved recently  but no AI system is good enough to understand conversational speech just yet  Speech recognition relies on both listening to what you say and predicting what you will say next  so structured speech is still much easier to understand than unstructured conversation   Another interesting limitation of speech recognition systems    and machine learning systems more generally    is that they are more optimized for specific problems than most people realize  For example  understanding a person talking to a computer is subtly different problem from understanding a person talking to another person  If you train a machine learning system on data from Google of people speaking to a search engine  it will perform relatively worse on Facebook at understanding people talking to real people  In the case of Jarvis  training an AI that you ll talk to at close range is also different from training a system you ll talk to from all the way across the room  like Echo  These systems are more specialized than it appears  and that implies we are further off from having general systems than it might seem   On a psychologic level  once you can speak to a system  you attribute more emotional depth to it than a computer you might interact with using text or a graphic interface  One interesting observation is that ever since I built voice into Jarvis  I ve also wanted to build in more humor  Part of this is that now it can interact with Max and I want those interactions to be entertaining for her  but part of it is that it now feels like it s present with us  I ve taught it fun little games like Priscilla or I can ask it who we should tickle and it will randomly tell our family to all go tickle one of us  Max or Beast  I ve also had fun adding classic lines like  I m sorry  Priscilla  I m afraid I can t do that    There s a lot more to explore with voice  The AI technology is just getting good enough for this to be the basis of a great product  and it will get much better in the next few years  At the same time  I think the best products like this will be ones you can bring with you anywhere and communicate with privately as well   Facebook Engineering Environment  As the CEO of Facebook  I don t get much time to write code in our internal environment  I ve never stopped coding  but these days I mostly build personal projects like Jarvis  I expected I d learn a lot about the state of AI this year  but I didn t realize I would also learn so much about what it s like to be an engineer at Facebook  And it s impressive   My experience of ramping up in the Facebook codebase is probably pretty similar to what most new engineers here go through  I was consistently impressed by how well organized our code is  and how easy it was to find what you re looking for    whether it s related to face recognition  speech recognition  the Messenger Bot Framework messenger com platform   or iOS development  The open source Nuclide github com facebook nuclide   packages we ve built to work with GitHub s Atom make development much easier  The Buck buckbuild com   build system we ve developed to build large projects quickly also saved me a lot of time  Our open source FastText github com facebookresearch fastTex      AI text classification tool is also a good one to check out  and if you re interested in AI development  the whole Facebook Research github com facebookresearch   GitHub repo is worth taking a look at   One of our values is  move fast   That means you should be able to come here and build an app faster than you can anywhere else  including on your own  You should be able to come here and use our infra and AI tools to build things it would take you a long time to build on your own  Building internal tools that make engineering more efficient is important to any technology company  but this is something we take especially seriously  So I want to give a shout out to everyone on our infra and tools teams that make this so good   Next Steps  Although this challenge is ending  I m sure I ll continue improving Jarvis since I use it every day and I m always finding new things I want to add   In the near term  the clearest next steps are building an Android app  setting up Jarvis voice terminals in more rooms around my home  and connecting more appliances  I d love to have Jarvis control my Big Green Egg and help me cook  but that will take even more serious hacking than rigging up the t shirt cannon   In the longer term  I d like to explore teaching Jarvis how to learn new skills itself rather than me having to teach it how to perform specific tasks  If I spent another year on this challenge  I d focus more on learning how learning works   Finally  over time it would be interesting to find ways to make this available to the world  I considered open sourcing my code  but it s currently too tightly tied to my own home  appliances and network configuration  If I ever build a layer that abstracts more home automation functionality  I may release that  Or  of course  that could be a great foundation to build a new product   Conclusions  Building Jarvis was an interesting intellectual challenge  and it gave me direct experience building AI tools in areas that are important for our future   I ve previously predicted that within 5 10 years we ll have AI systems that are more accurate than people for each of our senses    vision  hearing  touch  etc  as well as things like language  It s impressive how powerful the state of the art for these tools is becoming  and this year makes me more confident in my prediction   At the same time  we are still far off from understanding how learning works  Everything I did this year    natural language  face recognition  speech recognition and so on    are all variants of the same fundamental pattern recognition techniques  We know how to show a computer many examples of something so it can recognize it accurately  but we still do not know how to take an idea from one domain and apply it to something completely different   To put that in perspective  I spent about 100 hours building Jarvis this year  and now I have a pretty good system that understands me and can do lots of things  But even if I spent 1 000 more hours  I probably wouldn t be able to build a system that could learn completely new skills on its own    unless I made some fundamental breakthrough in the state of AI along the way   In a way  AI is both closer and farther off than we imagine  AI is closer to being able to do more powerful things than most people expect    driving cars  curing diseases  discovering planets  understanding media  Those will each have a great impact on the world  but we re still figuring out what real intelligence is   Overall  this was a great challenge  These challenges have a way of teaching me more than I expected at the beginning  This year I thought I d learn about AI  and I also learned about home automation and Facebook s internal technology too  That s what s so interesting about these challenges  Thanks for following along with this challenge and I m looking forward to sharing next year s challenge in a few weeks,"[632 241 586 680 529 164 610 65 998 154 775]"

634,training-dataset/business/1311.txt,business,The Top Idea in Your Mind        Want to start a startup  Get funded by Y Combinator   July 2010    I realized recently that what one thinks about in the shower in the morning is more important than I d thought  I knew it was a good time to have ideas  Now I d go further  now I d say it s hard to do a really good job on anything you don t think about in the shower     Everyone who s worked on difficult problems is probably familiar with the phenomenon of working hard to figure something out  failing  and then suddenly seeing the answer a bit later while doing something else  There s a kind of thinking you do without trying to  I m increasingly convinced this type of thinking is not merely helpful in solving hard problems  but necessary  The tricky part is  you can only control it indirectly    1      I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any given time  That s the idea their thoughts will drift toward when they re allowed to drift freely  And this idea will thus tend to get all the benefit of that type of thinking  while others are starved of it  Which means it s a disaster to let the wrong idea become the top one in your mind     What made this clear to me was having an idea I didn t want as the top one in my mind for two long stretches     I d noticed startups got way less done when they started raising money  but it was not till we ourselves raised money that I understood why  The problem is not the actual time it takes to meet with investors  The problem is that once you start raising money  raising money becomes the top idea in your mind  That becomes what you think about when you take a shower in the morning  And that means other questions aren t     I d hated raising money when I was running Viaweb  but I d forgotten why I hated it so much  When we raised money for Y Combinator  I remembered  Money matters are particularly likely to become the top idea in your mind  The reason is that they have to be  It s hard to get money  It s not the sort of thing that happens by default  It s not going to happen unless you let it become the thing you think about in the shower  And then you ll make little progress on anything else you d rather be working on    2       I hear similar complaints from friends who are professors  Professors nowadays seem to have become professional fundraisers who do a little research on the side  It may be time to fix that      The reason this struck me so forcibly is that for most of the preceding 10 years I d been able to think about what I wanted  So the contrast when I couldn t was sharp  But I don t think this problem is unique to me  because just about every startup I ve seen grinds to a halt when they start raising money or talking to acquirers     You can t directly control where your thoughts drift  If you re controlling them  they re not drifting  But you can control them indirectly  by controlling what situations you let yourself get into  That has been the lesson for me  be careful what you let become critical to you  Try to get yourself into situations where the most urgent problems are ones you want to think about     You don t have complete control  of course  An emergency could push other thoughts out of your head  But barring emergencies you have a good deal of indirect control over what becomes the top idea in your mind     I ve found there are two types of thoughts especially worth avoiding thoughts like the Nile Perch in the way they push out more interesting ideas  One I ve already mentioned  thoughts about money  Getting money is almost by definition an attention sink  The other is disputes  These too are engaging in the wrong way  they have the same velcro like shape as genuinely interesting ideas  but without the substance  So avoid disputes if you want to get real work done    3      Even Newton fell into this trap  After publishing his theory of colors in 1672 he found himself distracted by disputes for years  finally concluding that the only solution was to stop publishing  I see I have made myself a slave to Philosophy  but if I get free of Mr Linus s business I will resolutely bid adew to it eternally  excepting what I do for my privat satisfaction or leave to come out after me  For I see a man must either resolve to put out nothing new or become a slave to defend it    4   Linus and his students at Liege were among the more tenacious critics  Newton s biographer Westfall seems to feel he was overreacting  Recall that at the time he wrote  Newton s  slavery  consisted of five replies to Liege  totalling fourteen printed pages  over the course of a year  I m more sympathetic to Newton  The problem was not the 14 pages  but the pain of having this stupid controversy constantly reintroduced as the top idea in a mind that wanted so eagerly to think about other things     Turning the other cheek turns out to have selfish advantages  Someone who does you an injury hurts you twice  first by the injury itself  and second by taking up your time afterward thinking about it  If you learn to ignore injuries you can at least avoid the second half  I ve found I can to some extent avoid thinking about nasty things people have done to me by telling myself  this doesn t deserve space in my head  I m always delighted to find I ve forgotten the details of disputes  because that means I hadn t been thinking about them  My wife thinks I m more forgiving than she is  but my motives are purely selfish     I suspect a lot of people aren t sure what s the top idea in their mind at any given time  I m often mistaken about it  I tend to think it s the idea I d want to be the top one  rather than the one that is  But it s easy to figure this out  just take a shower  What topic do your thoughts keep returning to  If it s not what you want to be thinking about  you may want to change something                 Notes      1   No doubt there are already names for this type of thinking  but I call it  ambient thought        2   This was made particularly clear in our case  because neither of the funds we raised was difficult  and yet in both cases the process dragged on for months  Moving large amounts of money around is never something people treat casually  The attention required increases with the amount maybe not linearly  but definitely monotonically       3   Corollary  Avoid becoming an administrator  or your job will consist of dealing with money and disputes       4   Letter to Oldenburg  quoted in Westfall  Richard  Life of

649,training-dataset/product/135.txt,product,Why you don t need design like Apple   The Startup   MediumWhy you don t need design like Apple  Authenticity vs  Beauty  Apple proved that beauty not only works  It sells   By marrying design and technology  Apple evolved from a niche brand for hobbyists into one of most valuable companies ever   After their success  many companies followed suit and leveled up on design   If you can t beat  em   Many of the products we spend our time with   our phones  laptops  and the software that comes with them   were originally designed  or at least inspired by Apple  And with Apple creating and managing the App Store  a huge chunk of the software industry is now required to have  Apple approved  design to survive   For design and beauty  our expectations as consumers are higher than they ve ever been  And the future of where products will compete will hinge more and more on the emotions driven from thoughtful  pleasurable design   As a designer  I appreciate this attention to design   I look at my laptop screen and the icons look like candy   I zip fluidly through my apps  getting hits of pleasure from well designed transitions along the way  The visual beauty of technology is so much different from how it was even just 10 years ago   A computer used to feel like you were navigating a maze in a cornfield  Uncertainty around every corner until you finally found the path to get something done   Yet  for all the good this focus on design has done for us  this same focus on visual polish has a cost   In our worship of the design and marketing of companies like Apple  we creators lose sight of an even more powerful way to present our ideas to the world   Because we ve seen the results of visual beauty in product design  we expect putting this level of focus on visual beauty in our brand s message will have the same effect   I ve seen companies spend tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars perfecting a website  email  or ad s visual design while spending the last few hours on writing the words that will make up that design   Our intense focus on visual design can blind us from focusing on the most important part of the message  The story   Choosing substance over style  We ve had a taste of this ourselves   A year ago  we sent out two versions of this email campaign   One email closely followed the principles of how a well designed email is supposed to look   Not too many words  A big  attractive image  A clear call to action  The other version took a different direction  We wrote it as if we were telling a story to a friend  It broke every rule   The email was long  There were 11 links before you got to the main call to action  The call to action was buried at the end  Here were the results   Even though our  less beautiful  email broke many of the rules  the longer  story version had almost three times the click through rate compared to the shorter version   Though this example is limited in that it was constrained to people in our community who might prefer a more story oriented approach  since this is our usual style   it supported our hunch that beauty isn t always best   And that being more authentic  i e  telling our story just like we d tell it to a friend  has a bigger impact than we might expect   A lesson from Pixar  It s not about animation  it s about story  There are examples of this same preference for a well told story in all creative fields   In 1995  Pixar released Toy Story  the first computer animated feature film  And while Toy Story went on to smash box office records  Pixar had a rocky start   Star Wars Director  George Lucas  sold his shares in Pixar before Toy Story was made  and Pixar almost went bankrupt  if  ironically  it weren t for Apple founder Steve Jobs stepping in to invest    The film industry thought a mainstream audience wouldn t care enough to see an animated feature film   What they neglected to see was the power of story   Even though animation was at its core  the Pixar team knew their success would ultimately fall on one simple thing  Their ability to tell a good story   Ed Catmull  one of the co founders of Pixar  wrote in his bestselling book Creativity  Inc  about his company s creative process    For all the care you put into artistry  visual polish frequently doesn t matter if you aren t getting the story right    Pixar has won the Academy Award for Best Animated Picture for 8 out of their 16 films  And every single Pixar film has landed on the respective year s top ten list of most profitable films   No other studio comes close to this hit rate   Telling a good story  whether that s through email  film  or any medium  creates a connection  And it s this connection that leads to attention  which leads to trust  which leads to sales   As Pixar realized early on  you can get away with lesser visual effects if your story is good  But the reverse is not always true   Case in point  if we look at the ten most expensive movies ever made  the average production cost was  274 million per film   And the average ranking across these films according to Rotten Tomatoes  59    The highest rated film was Tangled at 90  which was produced by Disney Pixar    Meanwhile  the average Pixar film cost an average of  145 million and averages an 89  review from critics and audiences alike   What s even more telling is that if we take a sampling of the critic consensus from the poorly rated movies in the top ten  you ll notice that critics rarely say the quality of the animation or special effects as the reason why they gave a bad rating   They cite issues with the story     this Pirates runs aground on a disjointed plot and a non stop barrage of noisy action sequences     Review of Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides    mixes in too many characters with too many incomprehensible plot threads     Review of Pirates of the Caribbean 3   While John Carter looks terrific and delivers its share of pulpy thrills  it also suffers from uneven pacing and occasionally incomprehensible plotting and characterization     Review of John Carter    a grim whirlwind of effects driven action     Review of Batman vs  Superman  While the other producers may have had the budgets to make something as visually stunning as Pixar  where they didn t level up was in their story   We can make something look pretty  But if pretty doesn t tell a good story it won t matter   Why beauty doesn t always work  especially today   Just like you can t rely on beauty alone in the design of your product  you can t only focus on beauty to tell your story   A well designed message is one that tells a good story first   As we saw in our email campaign example  a story is powerful enough to overcome an email design that breaks all the rules   You might not have Apple s marketing budget   1 2 billion this year  or design chops  But that s okay  Sometimes Apple level beauty isn t the best way to present your story  And sometimes it might even make things worse   In a recent article published by BBC  researchers from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte reviewed findings on if there was a drawback to being  too beautiful    The researchers uncovered several studies  including one in 1975 that found people tend to move away from a beautiful woman on a pathway  A similar behavior was found from a review of the profile photos from the dating website OKCupid  Men with  average  looking profile photos got more messages than men with the  most attractive  profile photos   The researchers suggested this behavior could be because attractiveness conveys power  As a result  people feel they need to respect an attractive person more and keep their distance   These examples illustrate that beauty can backfire  If something is too beautiful it can be seen as less approachable  further distancing you from the people you are trying to reach   Similarly  clothing brands like American Eagle recently saw an increase in sales after they stopped photoshopping models   Too much beauty can be seen as a sales tactic  Though we may be attracted to something that looks good  we also have a strong unconscious aversion to being sold to   And this aversion is getting stronger   First  because of the internet and the power of online networks like Facebook  we have more access to information  which means we see more instances of bad things   For instance  of the top movie documentaries all time listed on Rotten Tomatoes  4 of the top 10 are stories of injustice or corruption and have been made since 2005   Every phone has become a media device  Stories spread fast  And while there s a lot of good happening in the world  stories of corruption and distrust tend to surface to the top because they grab our attention   Trust is at an all time low  As this 2013 USA Today poll suggests  two thirds of Americans polled said they were suspicious of others  This is double the rate of distrust since the survey was first done in 1972   We ve become hypersensitive to bullshit  We have an increasing lack of trust for everything  including beauty   Beauty can be perceived as a layer of bullshit  making people feel like they are being sold to   As one of the lead researchers from the study said   If you are obsessing about attractiveness  it may alter your experience and interactions    This is exactly it   If we focus too much on the visual attraction of our message  the experience people have with our stories will likely suffer   Increase in information  Decrease in attention  Adding to our natural aversion to being sold to  we ve become overloaded with things vying for our attention   In the last decade  as the world moved mostly online  messages started to attack us everywhere  And these messages are smart  With billboards we could just look away  With TV radio we could shut it off  But today s messages are connected to all the tools we use to communicate  And brought to us by people we trust    If we focus too much on the visual attraction of our message  the experience people have with our stories will likely suffer    Facebook  Twitter  Email  Phones  Laptops  Tablets  Notifications come flying at us from all angles  Because today s messages come in bits and pings  they are cheap  effective  and easy to spread   With so much access to information  we only have two options   Either we try to consume everything  which isn t possible  or we filter  i e  we stop paying attention to a lot of things    Since we can t consume everything  we ve become experts at filtering  Filtering out crap  Filtering anything that looks remotely untrustworthy or has the tiniest hint of salesmanship   To quote multi platinum musician Rihanna    My fans can sniff the BS from very far away  I cannot trick them    Our brains have actually changed to adapt to the current information overload   A recent study by Microsoft on Canadians found that our attention spans have dropped by a quarter  from 12 seconds to 8 seconds  since 2000  which is less than the attention span of a goldfish   There s a general fatigue that s happening  We ve been forced into becoming B S  detection experts   While ads and marketing may have gotten prettier and better with more data  we ve gotten better at filtering  Resisting   It s an arms race  And it might seem like we re doomed to lose as creators  That no will ever care what we have to say   But we re not  There s an easy solution   The solution is easy and you already know how to do it  When you see an email from a friend saying   hey lets catchup for coffee monday  you in   it cuts through everything   Even though it breaks every standard of writing  no capitalization  missing punctuation  It grabs your attention  You answer it first  Why   First  this message comes from a person you trust so that plays a huge factor  But  adding to the trust you have in the messenger  is a message you know came from a human  Not a machine   There s no fancy headlines  graphics  or words so you feel safe  You re not being gamed  You can let your guard down for a second   There s plenty of results to back up that you don t need visual beauty to connect with people   Multi platinum musician Beyonce s most watched music video on her YouTube channel is her song  7 11  Even though many of Beyonce s music videos have a high production quality  7 11 is shot with low quality video  Yet  it outperformed every other Beyonce video   Kelly Starrett is a physiotherapist and trainer who has some of the most consistently viewed fitness videos on YouTube  He recorded most videos with a phone in his garage with no professional gear   Some of Kelly s videos even show his daughter accidentally walking in and  mistakes  in editing   Kelly could have edited these things out but because they were kept in  I feel an even deeper connection with him  These  mistakes  make me feel like Kelly is a human and he s not trying to sell me  Like he s one of my friends in his garage figuring something out and he s sending over a video for me to check it out   He s a person who has kids  a dog  a somewhat messy garage  And he shoots low resolution  unedited videos just like me  I can relate to that  His videos aren t the highest quality or the nicest shot  But what they do have is some of the best fitness coaching I ve ever seen  They have substance  So I trust Kelly  When I m looking for fitness tips  I search Kelly first  When Kelly wrote a book  I bought it   Maybe if Beyonce and Kelly used professional equipment for these videos  viewership would have increased  but the way they shot these videos in raw form is partly what makes them attractive  These videos make Beyonce and Kelly seem approachable and relatable   Comedian Louis C K  does a similar thing with the emails he writes   Louis sends email newsletters that feel like he s just writing to you  Some have spelling mistakes or improper punctuation but that s part of them  I don t care about those grammar mistakes  In fact  I like them  It makes me feel like Louis is simply talking to me like he would talk to a friend   Here s an example   Time and again we see the substance of the story is more important than the look of it   We don t need beauty to connect with people  When we sense someone is being  real  with us  our brain s natural urge to resist influence is calmed   What your message needs is authenticity  Your unique way of sharing your message with all its blemishes and imperfect sentences,"[649 589 1314 561 154

667,training-dataset/business/751.txt,business,The days are long but the decades are short I turned 30 last week and a friend asked me if I d figured out any life advice in the past decade worth passing on  I m somewhat hesitant to publish this because I think these lists usually seem hollow  but here is a cleaned up version of my answer         1  Never put your family  friends  or significant other low on your priority list  Prefer a handful of truly close friends to a hundred acquaintances  Don t lose touch with old friends  Occasionally stay up until the sun rises talking to people  Have parties     2  Life is not a dress rehearsal this is probably it  Make it count  Time is extremely limited and goes by fast  Do what makes you happy and fulfilled few people get remembered hundreds of years after they die anyway  Don t do stuff that doesn t make you happy  this happens most often when other people want you to do something   Don t spend time trying to maintain relationships with people you don t like  and cut negative people out of your life  Negativity is really bad  Don t let yourself make excuses for not doing the things you want to do   3  How to succeed  pick the right thing to do  this is critical and usually ignored   focus  believe in yourself  especially when others tell you it s not going to work   develop personal connections with people that will help you  learn to identify talented people  and work hard  It s hard to identify what to work on because original thought is hard   4  On work  it s difficult to do a great job on work you don t care about  And it s hard to be totally happy fulfilled in life if you don t like what you do for your work  Work very hard a surprising number of people will be offended that you choose to work hard but not so hard that the rest of your life passes you by  Aim to be the best in the world at whatever you do professionally  Even if you miss  you ll probably end up in a pretty good place  Figure out your own productivity system don t waste time being unorganized  working at suboptimal times  etc  Don t be afraid to take some career risks  especially early on  Most people pick their career fairly randomly really think hard about what you like  what fields are going to be successful  and try to talk to people in those fields   5  On money  Whether or not money can buy happiness  it can buy freedom  and that s a big deal  Also  lack of money is very stressful  In almost all ways  having enough money so that you don t stress about paying rent does more to change your wellbeing than having enough money to buy your own jet  Making money is often more fun than spending it  though I personally have never regretted money I ve spent on friends  new experiences  saving time  travel  and causes I believe in   6  Talk to people more  Read more long content and less tweets  Watch less TV  Spend less time on the Internet   7  Don t waste time  Most people waste most of their time  especially in business   8  Don t let yourself get pushed around  As Paul Graham once said to me   People can become formidable  but it s hard to predict who    There is a big difference between confident and arrogant  Aim for the former  obviously    9  Have clear goals for yourself every day  every year  and every decade   10  However  as valuable as planning is  if a great opportunity comes along you should take it  Don t be afraid to do something slightly reckless  One of the benefits of working hard is that good opportunities will come along  but it s still up to you to jump on them when they do   11  Go out of your way to be around smart  interesting  ambitious people  Work for them and hire them  in fact  one of the most satisfying parts of work is forging deep relationships with really good people   Try to spend time with people who are either among the best in the world at what they do or extremely promising but totally unknown  It really is true that you become an average of the people you spend the most time with   12  Minimize your own cognitive load from distracting things that don t really matter  It s hard to overstate how important this is  and how bad most people are at it  Get rid of distractions in your life  Develop very strong ways to avoid letting crap you don t like doing pile up and take your mental cycles  especially in your work life   13  Keep your personal burn rate low  This alone will give you a lot of opportunities in life   14  Summers are the best   15  Don t worry so much  Things in life are rarely as risky as they seem  Most people are too risk averse  and so most advice is biased too much towards conservative paths   16  Ask for what you want   17  If you think you re going to regret not doing something  you should probably do it  Regret is the worst  and most people regret far more things they didn t do than things they did do  When in doubt  kiss the boy girl   18  Exercise  Eat well  Sleep  Get out into nature with some regularity   19  Go out of your way to help people  Few things in life are as satisfying  Be nice to strangers  Be nice even when it doesn t matter   20  Youth is a really great thing  Don t waste it  In fact  in your 20s  I think it s ok to take a  Give me financial discipline  but not just yet  attitude  All the money in the world will never get back time that passed you by   21  Tell your parents you love them more often  Go home and visit as often as you can   22  This too shall pass   23  Learn voraciously   24  Do new things often  This seems to be really important  Not only does doing new things seem to slow down the perception of time  increase happiness  and keep life interesting  but it seems to prevent people from calcifying in the ways that they think  Aim to do something big  new  and risky every year in your personal and professional life   25  Remember how intensely you loved your boyfriend girlfriend when you were a teenager  Love him her that intensely now  Remember how excited and happy you got about stuff as a kid  Get that excited and happy now   26  Don t screw people and don t burn bridges  Pick your battles carefully   27  Forgive people   28  Don t chase status  Status without substance doesn t work for long and is unfulfilling   29  Most things are ok in moderation  Almost nothing is ok in extreme amounts   30  Existential angst is part of life  It is particularly noticeable around major life events or just after major career milestones  It seems to particularly affect smart  ambitious people  I think one of the reasons some people work so hard is so they don t have to spend too much time thinking about this  Nothing is wrong with you for feeling this way  you are not alone   31  Be grateful and keep problems in perspective  Don t complain too much  Don t hate other people s success  but remember that some people will hate your success  and you have to learn to ignore it    32  Be a doer  not a talker   33  Given enough time  it is possible to adjust to almost anything  good or bad  Humans are remarkable at this   34  Think for a few seconds before you act  Think for a few minutes if you re angry   35  Don t judge other people too quickly  You never know their whole story and why they did or didn t do something  Be empathetic   36  The days are long but the decades are short,"[667 1316 456 561 154

the right morning routine to set the day right  For others  the right evening routine is what it takes to get ahead for the next day   We ve found there s no one way to organize your work day   and that the best fit looks different for every person   Here are a few examples from our team to help inspire some different ideas to arrange your workday for optimal productivity and creativity   Structure doesn t have to be a dirty word  Sometimes   structure  gets a bad reputation  seen as constraining more than freeing  However  that isn t always the case    I believe structure is necessary because structure and creativity have the same parentage   writes Steve Dennings in a Forbes article   It is structure that enables creativity    Workfront put together this great Slideshare from marketing creatives about the benefits of structure   We ve found that the ideal routine doesn t come about instantly  but with intention  you can find the best balance for you   Morning routines  Starting the day right  Joel  Buffer s CEO  Rising early to set the tone for the day  I feel that waking up early sets the tone of  making a choice  for my day  If I leave it to fate as to when I roll out of bed  then I feel like that s the outlook I m taking in general  On the other hand  if I choose to get up early and do amazing things in those quiet hours  that s when I feel like I m grabbing hold of my life and controlling where I go  That s the choice I want to make   When I started Buffer whilst working 5 days per week  it was the choice to work an hour first thing in the morning each day when I was freshest that made a huge difference   Kevan  Marketing Lead  Start with the  Tomorrow List   Mine has evolved quite a bit over the past several months and will likely keep evolving  It feels like I ve settled into a pretty good rhythm with this schedule   Wake up at 5 30 a m   Consult my to do list  which I create the night before  Head to the computer and start writing a blog post  Shower breakfast at 7 00 a m   Back to writing  Alfred Lua  Content Crafter  Work with my circadian rhythm  I know I m more of an early bird and I need at least about 7 hours of sleep every night  Hence  I always try to go to bed by 10pm so that I can wake up by 6am the next day and have a good 8 hours of sleep  Also  I tend to get sleepy in the afternoon so I have been taking a 25 minute power nap after my lunch   Check out more morning routines here   Exercise early  Julia  Happiness Hero  Yoga or a walk to start the day  I feel like I m constantly re considering my strategies  and always

personal Buffer queue   I ve found it to be really helpful to then take a break from the computer screen by doing yoga before popping in the Buffer inbox   Establish priorities first thing  Jordan

what I will be working focusing on   Mike E  Customer Researcher  Tackle the biggest task first  I also try and tackle my biggest task for the day first  I find that with the most intimidating things

also been really helpful  Lately  I feel like starting the day with a quick mental check in about my energy levels also helps in terms of figuring out whether I can power through things today  or if I have to change up the pace as I move through the day   Hailley  PR Specialist  Tracking tasks in Todoist  focusing on the biggest one  Currently  I keep track of all of my tasks in Todoist and start my day focusing in on whichever one is biggest  I try to have 3   5 priorities for the week and only 3   5 tasks for the day to make sure I can accomplish all of them   The power of Mondays  Emily  Engineer  Limiting meetings to Mondays  I ve found that having meetings for the week on Monday for planning stuff and then having mostly heads down time the rest of the week really helps set focus and get motivated for the week   I also have found keeping a Paper doc of all the things I want to accomplish for the week to be super valuable  Helps me keep priorities in mind and reduces the amount of work I need to do to figure out what to do next  It can also be a great tool to stay in check with what my productivity looks like week to week  I also really like using Self Control to block distracting websites during the day   Mike E  Customer Researcher  A weekly Evernote list  For planning I create a note in Evernote with a list of everything I want to do in the week  and then before each day I try and grab three things from the list to achieve in that day  the goal to have one big thing  and two small things   I m not 100  sold on Evernote though  I think I spend too much time flicking back and forth between notes on there  Might try the  analog  notebook option   Carving out focus time and meeting time  Hailley  PR Specialist  Grouping calls for focus time  I found when I was on the West Coast  all of my calls were in the morning then I could do focused work in the afternoons  and it was the opposite in Europe with calls afternoons and focus in the mornings  Being back on the East Coast now I find most of my calls are right in the middle of the day   Stephanie  Life Saver Ops  Optimizing collaborative hours  I structure my days based on what my ongoing projects are and which teammates I m working closely with   that really helps with timezoning and figuring out when the key collaborative hours are for me during each week  This also helps for giving a sense of whether I have blocks of time where I can do quiet work or take a guilt free break  Also a huge fan of having an  extended mind  approach and putting everything down in notes to dos in my Asana account ahead of time   Nicole  Community Champion  Scheduling around nap times  I tend to schedule my meetings around nap times  I m so fortunate to work from home with my toddler and also take care of him   and fill in shorter tasks in between  I try to keep one day open for a coffee shop workday where I have a babysitter look after the little one and I can really dig into the bigger tasks for the week  Ideally  this being on a Monday sets the week off with a really productive feeling   Reminders and to do lists  Tigran  Engineer  Sometimes simple is best   the  txt to do file  I have a simple  txt file called  buffer notes  where I have all my to dos for today  tomorrow and the week  So every day at the end of my working day I fill in my to do tasks for tomorrow  So far it works great   For my personal tasks I use Todoist  I try to keep my list under 5 tasks for a day otherwise I never end up completing them all  In terms of the calls I try to have them in the afternoon since I feel I m very productive in the mornings   Dan  Architect  Reminders and blocking time in calendar  I m a huge reminders person now for scheduling things  I m normally a person who usually wings it  I try to keep things in my head  I m trying to get better at blocking time out in my calendar for tasks and I keep a Trello board of my current responsibilities and things I have upcoming  in progress and complete   Slack s reminders are awesome    remind me to have a call with Bob at 3pm   Alfred Lua  Content Crafter  Planning a week ahead  Instead of planning on a daily basis  I try to plan a week ahead  usually on a Sunday  I will schedule the major activities in my calendar and also leave room for last minute tasks or events  I found that this keeps me productive and allows me to take a slightly longer term view of things instead of only focusing on each day   David Gasquez  Data Analyst  Geekiness to keep the motivation  I ve tried many methods and this one has been working really well for the past couple of years  I add tasks into Taskwarrior as soon as they come to my mind  I ve also have it linked with a personal Trello board to keep track of everything in a visual way  This workflow has a very low friction  just opening a terminal  and allows me to explore with different methodologies and flows   Going old school  Paper planners and journals  Julian  Data Analyst  Limiting meetings throughout the day  I m all about the notebook  but shooting for as few meetings as possible is also great   Deborah  Culture Scout  Bullet journaling FTW  I m addicted to the Bullet

Planner  I ve experimented quite a bit over the past  oh  15 years with various planners  to do lists  apps and more   I still have almost all of my day planners from high school and college   I ve

678,training-dataset/product/1046.txt,product,The Unexpected Design Challenge Behind Slack s New Threaded ConversationsAt first blush  threaded conversations sound like one of the most thoroughly mundane features a messaging app could introduce   After all  the idea of neatly bundling up a specific message and its replies in one place rather than weaving them willy nilly with unrelated items has been around since the days of dial up bulletin boards  In one form or another  it s present in Facebook  Twitter  Gmail  and innumerable other places where people communicate with each other  But when Slack s users started asking for threaded conversations  the company behind the hit workplace collaboration tool soon concluded that the capability wasn t something it could whip up in a jiffy  It did  however  begin to noodle around with the idea and try different approaches  And  eventually  to use a prototype version internally while continuing to polish it up for public consumption  In all  that unhurried exploration has taken nearly two years and around six significant iterations of the prototype  during which Slack usage has grown eightfold to 4 million daily active users  Now the company is finally rolling out threaded conversations which it logically calls Threads to every team  including both paying customers and those who use the freebie version  Threads aren t just a major new Slack feature  They re also a case study in how its designers approach product development  The company has never operated under the guiding principle that Mark Zuckerberg once famously summed up as  move fast and break things   Instead  it has thrived in part because it aspires to offer tools that feel fully baked from the get go  Its fit and finish resemble those of the slickest consumer apps  in a world in which many business centric tools still don t feel like they were designed for use by human beings  Even by Slack standards  threaded conversations got extra TLC  because their impact is so great and so many people had been asking for them for so long   Threads are so close to the heart of what Slack is that they might be an escalated case   says Joshua Goldenberg  head of design  What Slack ended up building bears only so much resemblance to threading as it appears in other products   It kind of seems like this is a solved problem   said April Underwood  Slack s VP of product  at a press briefing about the new feature   But not in the context of work   How Slack s new Threads feature works Inside or Outside  One of the most fundamental questions Slack faced about threaded conversations was where to put them  The most obvious answer was to stick them in line with all the other items in a channel  So that s where the company started  By late 2015  it had a functional prototype  after some additional refinement  it started using this version in house in its own everyday work   By putting this rough draft through its paces  Slack discovered that putting threaded conversations inside a channel didn t so much eliminate clutter as reshuffle it  People didn t always remember that responses should be part of a thread  which turned channels into a mishmash of threaded and unthreaded discussions  The company s designers also concluded that one possible approach to tidying things up showing threads in collapsed form and allowing users to expand them would cause conscientious employees to obsessively expand conversations to see what was in them  A prototype version of Threads  with replies appearing in line  We could have brought this product to market maybe even a year ago  if in line was okay   said Paul Rosania  Slack s core product lead  at the media briefing  Instead  the company turned off the prototype it was using and began the search for a way to wrangle threads that actually helped reduce cacophony  The answer turned out to be putting threads alongside the main river of channel messages  in the section along the right hand edge of the Slack interface officially called the  flex pane  that is also home to elements such as search results  When people start responding to a message  thereby spawning a thread  the channel displays a counter of how many replies there are  along with thumbnail images of folks who have chimed in  If you click to expand a thread  it opens up in the flex pane  providing a degree of separation from the main conversation in the channel  Another design decision the company made in the interest of keeping conversations from getting tangled  The replies in a thread can t spawn further levels of threaded discussion   A thread can only hang off a single message  and that s the entirety of its depth   says Goldenberg  Just Enough Notifications Once Slack had relocated Threads to the flex pane  its designers had other critical decisions left to make  One was how to handle notifications so that people who cared about a thread could keep tabs  and those who didn t could ignore it  Anyone who posts a message that results in a thread gets notifications about replies  as does anyone who is   mentioned in the resulting conversation  Other users can choose to receive notifications by following individual threads   We re moving away from the idea that everyone needs to see everything all the time in a channel     View All Threads   a new view accessible from the left hand channel sidebar  lets people see all the threads they re following in one place similar to how Slack already lets you view all the unread messages in all your channels   It s an extra layer of making sure that you don t have to go diving for things within a channel   Goldenberg says  At one point during development of Threads  Slack pondered whether to let users cut off a thread by declaring it to be closed an option that s available on many message boards that support threading  and is often used to perform tasks such as declaring a tech support query to have been answered  In the end  letting people close threads  seemed a little bit too heavyweight   says Goldenberg   A little too prescriptive for casual use   But even if Slack s designers didn t want to encourage anyone to shut down a conversation in process  they did think that some threads would wind down in ways that mattered to people who weren t part of the discussion   Sometimes there will be a critical decision that everyone needs to see   says Goldenberg  The result  Threads offers a check box that lets you post a reply back to the channel as well as the thread  Select it  and the service puts a summary in the channel showing the original message and the most recent one  That summary is important because the act of putting threads in the flex pane is  in part  a statement that Slack doesn t expect people to try to keep up with all of them from top to bottom   We re moving away from the idea that everyone needs to see everything all the time in a channel   Goldenberg explains  Going Public As it worked on Threads  Slack did some user research and exposed the feature to some of its own partners  such as its PR firm  that spent time inside its internal Slack channels  But the main thing that informed development of Threads was the experience of using it in prototype form and thinking about feedback that the company gets from Slack users both specific feature requests and more open ended pleas for new ways to get stuff done and combat information overload   We are really immersed in the problems our customers are trying to solve   Rosania said at the media briefing   That gives us some clarity about where to go,"[678 789 1349 1045 561 154 878 327 798 552 609]"

our Director of Product Design  If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the interview  but if you re short on time  here are five key takeaways  Given today s technology  chatbots are best left to handling computation  Things that require empathy or emotion  on the other hand  are still better handled by a human  From Airbnb s launch of Trips to Instagram s addition of Stories  products built as systems rather than a set of screens became more prevalent in the past year  As new uses are demanded for your product  your system will have to expand  Breakthrough products target existing behaviors  rather than asking users to break from the norm  2016 featured two prime examples of the former  Snapchat Spectacles and Tesla s solar tiles  Product teams must make a philosophical shift after they launch a product  As the team enters iteration  every previous decision is back on the table  Defining conversational commerce as sending texts to a bot is simply too narrow  Product builders must expand that view and look at their product as an ecosystem with many endpoints   and messaging is just one of them  Des Traynor  Today I m lucky to be joined by Paul Adams  our VP of Product  and Emmet Connolly  our Director of Product Design  2016 was marked in a lot of ways by bots  We had our own opinions  and we had our own experiments  as did the entire industry  Is the future of product design really gonna sit inside a chat bubble  Paul Adams  Both Emmet and I wrote a lot of blog posts about bots over the year  and we built a lot of bots too  Some of them saw the light of day  some didn t  We learned that bots are overhyped  For very human things like empathy and emotion  bots are terrible  What we didn t realize is that bots do work for a very specific set of use cases that are probably narrower than people first imagined  There was a crazy AI vision of the future  where bots are as intelligent as humans  and our biggest realization was that bots are good at some things  and humans are good at other things  Bots are really good at computation  Bots are basically simple computers  so if you need to ask somebody what your next bill was gonna be  a bot can calculate that far faster than a human  who d have to look up the system  find your account  look at the UI and find the number  For very human things like empathy  emotion and reading between the lines of what someone s actually trying to say  bots are terrible at that  given today s technology  Des  Emmet  from a design perspective  it sounds like you d have to spend half your time dealing with whether or not the bot knows the answer  In the majority of cases the bot s probably not going do a good job  right  Emmet Connolly  We have a system whereby a human or a bot could answer your question  and so it becomes more of a rooting problem than a problem of   What do I do in this failure case where the bot doesn t know the answer   If the bot doesn t know an answer  or can t provide a great one  then the human should provide the answer   Paul and Emmet s teams designed Educate  Intercom s new knowledge base product  for bots to supplement a human customer support where appropriate  A lot of the pitfalls we saw this year were use cases where people building these bots were over promising what they could deliver  The technology for an English language level conversation really isn t there yet  and that has plunged us into this trough of disillusionment  That s also a good place to be  because it means that we re getting real about what s actually possible  If 2016 was the year of hype around this  we could actually see a lot of real life  useful tools and products emerge in the next year  Des  It s really convenient  the way these things pick whole years in which they re going to experience these iterations  We see bots that pretend to be humans  like   Hi  I m Barry the airline bot  how can I book you a flight   And then you see bots that are blatantly bots  like   I m the little operator bot  and I m going to point you in the right direction   You said the idea of trying to humanize these bots isn t something that we want to do at Intercom  but what s the general thinking there  The degree to which you personify the bot evokes a very different reaction in the end user  Emmet  Our thinking has actually evolved a lot as we ve tried out a lot of the experiments that Paul mentioned  Initially the thing that seemed most obvious to me was   Hey  these are friendly little robots that can interact in your conversation  Let s make them be tiny Pixar characters   That s not what resonated with the users that we put our early bot iterations in front of  The nuance of tweaking a little bit of the language or the degree to which you personify the bot evokes a very different reaction in the end user  Some of our early experiments had people saying   Hey  I m  bot name   I m not a real person  but I have a character   People didn t like that at all  because hey felt slightly duped by it  They thought they were here to talk to a person  If you can insert a level of automation and   Hey  I am an automated bot that s here to speed up the process   then people can see the value in that  and it doesn t feel like a bit of a bait and switch  Des  We had a command line once upon a time   Write in the exact word and you ll get the exact answer   Do you think people s behavior changes when they know they re talking to a bot  Do they still continue the formalities and the civility and the   Hey  I m curious about    or is it just like   Flights please   Paul  For me  this thing is a scale  At one end of the scale is a command line interface  where it s clear that you re talking to a computer  People don t actually  in many cases  turn around and ask themselves   What is a bot   There s no actual common definition  We  in one of our blog posts  said that a bot is a simple computer program that executes  and then to Emmet s point  you can give it a face  you can give it a name  and you can make it more or less human like  If the command line interface is one end of the scale  at the opposite end is what Facebook was trying to do  whereby you didn t know if you re talking to a person or a bot  and clearly there somewhere is the uncanny valley  We didn t get close to the uncanny valley  We were far down the path of this is clearly a computer program  The minute it started pretending it was anything other than a computer  people reacted very negatively to it   Bots are most effective today when users know exactly what they re interacting with  Des  So it comes down to honesty and transparency  Emmet  Partially  I also think part of the 2016 exuberance from bots was around this sense of   Check out this very simple use case that I made up  screen shot  and put in my blog post   and people with a sense for product said   Wow  that does seem like a real new simple way of doing things   Then when you try and actually build these things  you realize that typing human  English language sentences to a robot isn t how you want to interact with a robot  If you give people a blank input field  it leaves a lot of room for the person to be rude to the robot or type pseudo commands or friendly questions to them  There s an evolution of the input on the end user s side that isn t quite so English language based  Maybe some of that standardizes around how you might be given a set of pre canned responses that you can send to the bot  which is faster than typing a whole sentence  It s easier because you actually know what you can say to the bot  which is another problem these blank input fields provide  If I m right about that  it s possible that that question of   What should your tone be when interacting with a bot   would go away  Des  If you follow that thread all the way  it s hard to see how that doesn t start to look like buttons that you click  It starts to look like UI  Emmet  The most salient characteristic of conversational UI is not necessarily that you re typing raw text in at the bottom of the screen  it s that you have this back and forth log of commands  It goes back and forth  and there s more ways of sending a command to the computer than typing it into the input field at the bottom  Des  And maybe there s not a predetermined order the command should be received in  and they would be in a form or something similar  Paul  Right  and to play at both sides there  there s also more ways than having this nice grid layout on a screen  with a left hand nav and a button at the bottom  and all the other common ways in which we ve come to expect products to work  The rise of systems Des  Paul  you spoke a lot this year about the idea that products should be thought of as systems rather than just a set of screens  How has that played out a lot in 2016  Have you seen a lot of new systems emerge  Paul  Most people building software are actually building and designing systems already   they just may not necessarily realize it  Systems are these broad networks of things that are related and connected  Uber is a simple example  Uber is certainly not a software company and certainly not an app company  Uber is this ecosystem of drivers  passengers  inventory  all sorts of things  Over time as that system emerged and evolved  Uber added things like surge pricing  Other parts of the system like price and availability and even where people drive   the whole thing changes  You change one piece of the system  and other the pieces of the system change  One example from this year that I use is Nike   Their app was totally redesigned this year  It used to be called Nike  Running  The redesign is now called Nike  Run Club  That s a sort of branding distinction  It s like   Oh  it s a club  There s other people  Oh  it s a system  All right  There are connected things happening in here   If you go into the Nike  Run Club app now  you can go on runs  track your mileage  all the normal stuff that running apps have  But they ve paid a lot more attention to the system of runners   runs with other people  meetups in different cities  your running shoes  Nike  had a lot of these components but they ve certainly doubled down on an idea that this is actually a broad ecosystem far beyond the app  The app is a conduit to other things happening in real life   Des  What about from the design perspective  Emmet  Have you seen any new things emerge in this regard  Emmet  Airbnb went through a similar transformation this year  The objects or actors in that system used to be things like guests and hosts and housing accommodation  Now they ve added Trips  very much broadening their scope  One would assume they ve had to evolve their underlying system to cater for these new things that they ve added  That suggests to me that the system will tend to expand as new uses are demanded  If you looked at the Instagram app earlier this year  the big button in the bottom middle would open your camera and you would post that to your stream  Now they ve added Stories and almost flipped what they re about  Now the button at the bottom is to upload a photo you ve taken before  That s your curated feed  Honestly  it s probably what Instagram was always about  Snapchat is the possibly unfair  hard to avoid comparison when you look at how Instagram has evolved their system  Snapchat in itself is an interesting example  because they came from a very chaotic place earlier in the year and they seem to be rationalizing a lot of concepts  You could say that Instagram and Snapchat are meeting in the middle having come from very opposite places  Targeting existing behaviors Des  Instagram started with a very clean system  It was very obvious you had your own stream and other people s streams  and that was it  Snapchat started from  frankly  who knows where  It was the most aggressive disrespect of systemic standards of software  I heard it argued a while ago that Snapchat s an unconventional UI was actually part of it s genius   it made the product somewhat viral because everyone had to teach each other how to use Snapchat  Snapchat themselves have had a interesting year  Aside from blowing up  they also released hardware for the first time  They took a really different approach from the likes of Apple  who are trying to get people to either replace or start wearing a watch  or Google Glass  who are trying to get people who don t wear glasses to wear glasses  Google actually had nothing to offer people who did wear glasses  which left them in a difficult situation  Snapchat said   Screw all that  Let s just sell some sunglasses   To me  that approach lines up  because they re targeting an existing behavior  sunglasses  with a better product  That is usually how good products happen  How do you see it  Paul  My take is pretty simple  These products are attempts at major breakthroughs for how people live and act  and the ones that are successful don t necessarily try to change people s behavior  They understand how people behave  act and think  and the new thing that emerges is congruent with that  This idea of building bridges to the future was very prevalent when I was at Google  Things like Google Glass and Google Wave  these were products that didn t really build bridges to the future  They were so different and forced people to act in totally new ways  People just didn t know what to do with them  Whereas Snapchat s glasses are sunglasses and that s it  They re sunglasses with a camera  and people wear sunglasses  If you actually watch the launch video for Snapchat s glasses  above   it s not people flying around on skateboards  It s literally a shot of normal life except they ve different sunglasses on  Google Glass s video had all this augmented reality  It was like a science fiction movie  It s obvious to me that the winners are the ones who don t try to radically alter society from the get go  Des  The bridge is the right concept for that  Snapchat could roll out a next version with a screen inside the lens that lets you see filters applied  but obviously they have to get there  Paul  Look at the development of the horse to the car  The very first things that emerged were basically horseless carriages  You can actually see a step by step progression  The winners are the ones who don t try to radically alter society from the get go  Fast forward to today and look at Tesla  The Tesla car doesn t need to look like a car  It doesn t have to have an engine at the front  The chassis is the mechanics of the car  but it still has something that looks like an engine and something that looks like a trunk  That s because people need this bridge  They re not going to buy a Tesla if it looks radically different to a car  Emmet  I wonder if this bridge to the future concept is especially true for consumer products  where no one wants to seem like a weirdo on a pseudo futuristic thing  The car is an interesting example  If you think about a thing that s likely to somehow achieve mass adoption at some stage over the next  x  years  it s self driving cars  There will be a gradual acceptance of the general public to self driving cars and your willingness to take your hands literally off the wheel and trust the computer  because that s a consumer use case  If you think about self driving trucks  fundamentally the same product  I would anticipate there will be an almost overnight switch as soon as it becomes possible from a regulation point of view  mostly from a bottom line finances  Some CFO of a massive company is going to make the switch overnight to self driving trucks  and likely the entire industry will follow within a very short amount of time  Shifting from product launch to iteration Des  You both spent a lot of the year working on our new Educate product  which is Intercom s take on a knowledge base  The product s launched  and we re in a different mode  What happens after launch for a team  Paul  It s been fascinating because the mode the team needs to work on almost the minute after the product launches is different to the one that they had before launch  This happens overnight  In the lead up to launch  design decisions are antagonized over for a long period of time  but they re at some point locked down  It was like   Do not open this conversation again  Do not increase the scope of this thing  Narrow  narrow  narrow  narrow  Get down to the hit list  Knock it off  Knock it off  Knock it off  No opening up of old things    The minute we launched  suddenly  that all goes away and everything s on the table again  It s the nature of all software that when you launch something  you ve got loads of stuff wrong  Loads  Even if you ve run a great beta  Suddenly  every single decision you made is up for debate again  It s very hard to suddenly accept that we might change it all and do it all a different way and iterate  A sign of a great product team is not what they ship in their version 1 0  It s version 1 1  Emmet  There s almost a tendency to become more conservative  You re thinking   We got it working  We finally got past the finish line   and now some people are using it and liking it  You have to be extremely brave at that point and say   There s a huge amount of input and information that we didn t have before   A sign of a great product team is not necessarily what they ship in their version 1 0  It s that version 1 1  That s when you really see how great a product team operates and thinks  how agile can they be in adapting to the new world where the rubber hits the road and their product is out there and they re getting feedback  Paul  Instagram impressed me in its early years because of it s simplicity  I was at Facebook when Instagram was acquired and the Instagram team was incredibly disciplined  There was pressure from all over the industry to add this or that  especially the minute Facebook acquired Instagram   Why doesn t Instagram have this feature if Facebook does and Facebook knows it works  They should just add it   The team was incredibly disciplined to keep Instagram really simple  A lot of Instagram s success in the early years was because it was so accessible and simple to understand  and they stuck to this core use case  Credit to them as Snapchat has moved the industry on  They ve been able to adapt and that is the sign of a great team  a team that can change  Des  They both represent proof that you do not need a large product footprint to have insane engagement  They re both relatively small product footprints  They have managed to get stronger  better  more engaging and more addictive without actually adding 15 more screens or 25 more workflows  which is stock B2B SaaS philosophy  What s to come in 2017 Des  We re going to do a lightning round  so short answers here  Voice as a user interface  will it be relevant in 2017  Paul  Absolutely  Huge  Emmet  No doubt  Des  Relevant in B2B as well  Emmet  Too early to say  Des  Conversational commerce   overhyped  absolute bullshit  very meaningful  Paul  Not overhyped  definitely a big deal  and probably has a bad name  Des  Conversational commerce is way too broad  Emmet  It still holds great promise for very specific use cases  but if you expect that all of commerce will move into your messenger you re probably sorely mistaken  Des  Virtual reality   will it be relevant in B2B and B2C in 2017 Emmet  Too early  I s time has come for gaming and that ll be exciting to see what the possibilities are  It doesn t feel like all the pieces are there yet  Des  Worst trend in product design today  Emmet  The silver bullet mentality  whether it s conversational commerce today  bots throughout this year or shiny buttons fifteen years ago  There s always something and you ve got to consider whether it s a trend or an actual new building block  Paul  AI  No one actually can define agreeably what AI even is  When most people say AI they mean if  then  this  that statements  Just take some humble pie and agree that we re not there yet  Des  What was your favorite new product of 2016 and why  Emmet  I have a very un sexy answer for this   the Belkin WeMo light switch  which has removed this very small but noticeable friction from my every night of shutting off all of the lamps around the room  At Google there used to be this concept of  does a product pass the toothbrush test  Would you use it at least a couple of times a day  This removes a very tiny thing but if you can make a tiny improvement a couple of times a day in every day of your life  that s decent  I will say that from a product point of view it s still a total mess  There s actually no system behind how home automation works to really tie it together so you have to Sellotape all the bits together  Paul  One of the most ingenious  amazing inventions of the past year was Tesla s roof tiles  Don t put these big panels on your house  just make tiles that do that instead  It harks back to the idea of building a bridge to the future   Would you rather  put this foreign looking sci fi object on your roof  or just swap out your tiles,"[529 680 610 561 154

684,training-dataset/business/99.txt,business,The Biggest Challenge of My Startup JourneyJanuary 3  2011  was my first day at Buffer as sort of the social media intern   The introductory task that Joel and I came up with was fairly simple  Spend 30 minutes a day on Buffer s Twitter account and help it grow  We had about 78 followers at the time  and the 100 follower mark was in sight   I had just turned 20 years old  was halfway through my second year in college and I was ready for anything really  It didn t matter what  I just wanted to go and do   So I did  I made a lot of mistakes and big messes to begin with  I started auto DM ing people on Twitter to push Buffer onto them like a used car salesman  I m still cringing now thinking about that  But also some good things  I discovered that simply interacting with people and giving great customer service goes a long way   From Twitter  I discovered blogs and blog comments in particular  I started to make friends with every single person who wrote anything remotely resembling the topic of social media and marketing   Joel had given me a copy of How to Win Friends and Influence People  and I was so hooked  No more sleazy tactics just making friends  being there for people with questions  and producing valuable content and insights  It was so fun   From intern to maker to manager  From there I discovered that I could in fact  write articles myself  So I did very poorly at first  and gradually better  Here s an example of one of my earlier posts  Over time  I churned out hundreds of posts and roughly worked from 8 a m  to 8 p m  every day  topped off with a daily sync with Joel at 8 p m  to go over open questions from the day  I remember falling into bed so tired and exhausted  but also so fulfilled  that I d jump straight out of bed the next morning to do it all over again  Commenting  writing blogposts  answering questions on Twitter  syncing with Joel  Rinse and repeat   Gradually  my role at Buffer changed and evolved and I learned about more things  How to get press coverage  how to raise money  how to hire people  how to do more marketing things  how to do business development and partnerships  how to have sales calls  how to do public speaking  how to do parts of product development and so much more  I even mixed in learning some Ruby on Rails and Javascript in there   I loved and still love learning about all those things  It was all doing  For the first 2 3 years  I was 100  doing things   As we started to bring more people on board  it was mostly on the product and customer service side  so I kept cranking things out bigger projects  bigger partnerships  bigger PR outlets  That s how I kept learning  by setting goals for myself  like  OK  we made TechCrunch  now let s get into the New York Times    After another year  I hit a ceiling  I m pretty sure I could still get a lot better on all those fronts  I was doing so many things simultaneously that I never truly became an expert at any of them  Yet I began to get less satisfaction out of writing that next blog post  even if it blew up to hundreds of thousands of readers and brought in lots of new customers   That was lucky  because slowly but surely the team had grown more and more  even on the marketing side  Suddenly I was in a position to do other things  That s when it dawned on me that it might not be about doing more  but about helping others do more  It was time to start a new journey to understand management   At first  I thought I d just pick up management in the same way that I picked up other skills  like PR or customer development   Now  about 2 years in  I m realizing that being a manager isn t just another skill  It s about changing at a much more fundamental level   Doing vs  managing  They re opposites in many ways  The first thing I noticed is that  doing  and  managing  are almost polar opposites  When I was doing  I was producing the work and needed lots of heads down time to make things  As a manager  I m producing almost nothing  The best thing I can do is help others who are doing all the producing   Yet all my life  I ve been so wired to  do   From the day I wanted to play pro soccer at age 6  it was all about doing putting in the work  training and showing up  Over and over again  like the blog posts later on at Buffer   I had to unlearn that forward motion of doing  Literally  When I m in one on one mentoring sessions today  the first thing I make sure to do is lean back physically in my chair   It s a signal to myself that I m not here to do  I m here to listen  The other person just had a full week of doing  so there are lots of challenges and achievements that came out of that  They ve had enough doing  they don t need me to jump in for another load of it   It reminds me a lot of meditation  where you first notice how many thoughts you have when you re sitting still  Slowly  gradually your thoughts become less  It happens all on its own by having that space and by me leaning back and letting go  In a way  being a manager is one big meditation exercise noticing my  doing  habits and gently avoiding acting on them   I m not here to do  I m here to listen   Empathy and listening have a whole new meaning for me since becoming more of a manager   To really listen is really hard  To stay with someone s thoughts as they take you through a challenge or opinion and not stopping them 10 seconds in with  Let me stop you there and give you the solution  is so hard  The habit of doing is so strong and ingrained that I want to pounce at every opportunity   When I don t do a good job of  leaning back   here s a look at what s going on in my brain when I m in a one on one with someone    Oh interesting  Yes  I see  a problem with this project  Yes  hmm  he she should do this  then say this to their team  They should also read this article  it s a good article about management and giving feedback  Hmm  generally everyone on the team should maybe read this article  Maybe after this I should share it with the team on Slack  Or on Twitter  I should maybe add it to my Buffer  I haven t been filling up my Buffer in a while  so I should do that a lot more  I think this ll get a lot of engagement on Twitter    And I m off on this train of thought  missing most of what the person said  To top it off  I jump in with my advice that I concluded about 10 seconds in   Try this quick listening exercise for yourself  Try this for yourself  Ask someone a question or have someone tell you a story and to just sit there and listen  Notice how your thoughts wander off to what you ll have for lunch later  or what you want to add to the conversation yourself  Notice how you get distracted by what else is going on  or someone else walking past  Bring it back to the person you re listening to every time  take in every word like it s the first spoken word you ve heard   This is so hard  but so rewarding  I started noticing so much more when I began this practice  How is someone saying it  really  Their hand movements  their body language  their tone  For me  this isn t a form of examination and scrutiny but really a way of true listening and wanting to understand what they re trying to put across   Practicing just listening is probably the most worthwhile thing I ve learned to do as a manager  Of course  there re so many other things to being a manager organizing  setting up of meetings  following up  making tough decisions about projects and people  holding people accountable  managing projects and more  But the biggest reward and challenge is in really listening and learning how to ask great questions   Asking better questions  True curiosity is key  Asking great questions is hard  too  For a long time I ve asked questions very poorly I still do  to a large degree  but I ve picked up on a few things  I think this is all connected to the  doing  again creating a habit of asking more questions instead of wanting to provide an answer after listening is all part of the rewiring process   I ve learned that any question I ask where I expect a specific answer isn t a very good question  Questions that start with  Would you  or  Do you  aren t good questions  because I m already assuming a very narrow set of possibilities   The good questions tend to be a bit more open ended and might start with  How  or  Why   Even those are hard sometimes I ask those questions with pure curiosity  but sometimes I disguise a  would you  question in there  Tricky stuff   But I ve gotten better  I ve learned that I don t need to know all the answers in fact  it s much better if I don t  The more questions I ask  the more likely the other person is to come up with the answer themselves   Finding happiness as the coach instead of the player  Sometimes going from lots of doing  writing and producing to listening and asking questions feels like bringing a car to a stop from 100 miles an hour  I m often particularly glad about working remotely  especially when I notice myself leaning forward and then back  forward and backward again It would look quite funny in an office   I ve learned that being a manager is a mindset shift  You re no longer a player  you re the coach  You can t score the winning goal anymore  no matter how hard you try   And I still try sometimes  I ve tried to direct someone step by step to score the winning goal from the sidelines  It doesn t work  The best way coaches can help is by listening  asking questions and only then making suggestions   Our friends at HelpScout actually refer to managers and individual contributors as coaches and players  respectively  The reasons why were very interesting to me    These words reinforce important associations for us culturally  First  when you think of professional sports  players come first  Fans wear player jerseys for a reason  Players   embody what we want to be about  A coach s role is to serve players  to help them seek excellence  and to ensure their team is greater than the sum of its parts    To help players seek excellence  I believe coaches need to see it from their viewpoint and share advice that s right for their situation and motivation  Not the old  This is what I have done that worked  so you should do it  too   Listening and then asking good questions is maybe the only way to get there   After 5 years at Buffer  this transition from maker to manager is the toughest and most rewarding thing I ve worked through so far  It s taken about 2 years and I still feel very early in the journey  Slowly  as I ve uncovered more blind spots and opportunities  I ve begun to see the full picture emerge of where I want to go to be a really good manager  That s maybe the most satisfying part  that I can now see the light no matter how far away it may seem sometimes   I d love to hear your thoughts on this  Do you gravitate toward the mindset of a maker or a manager  or some combination of the two  How do you practice skills like deeply listening and asking great questions  I m keen to get your insights  tips and feedback in the comments,"[684 1025 1174 421 1316 1073 1145 253 154 51 561]"

your product is  and what it does  can mean very different things for different people  Take Snapchat  At one time it s a photography app  an augmented reality app  and a social network  all for very different customers  These different assumptions and observations of what your product can do build up over time  and form different mental models  And these are the lenses through which customers see your product  I recently discussed these mental models on the first stop of the Inside Intercom World Tour in London  I explained how to design around a customer s mental model  and how to help them create new ones   why you should use the nouns and verbs your customers are using  and the benefits of using well established patterns  You can watch my talk  or have a read below  Transcript I m going to talk to you today about something I think about a lot and anyone who s building a product should be thinking about  And that s how do users understand new products  When you re building a new product  how are people going to understand what it is  what it does and the value it s going to deliver  A while ago I came across an exercise that really clearly illustrates how different people can think about the same thing in very different ways  And that thing is toast  The exercise works by asking people to take a sheet of paper and a pen and draw the process of making toast  Different customers  Different assumptions  It seems very simple  but what you ll get is something like this to start with  One person will draw making toast like this   you take bread  you put it in the toaster  and out comes the toast   But this is just one person s illustration of how you make toast  In fact if you ask a lot of people to do this  you ll get many versions of how people make toast   For some people  it s all around the person s involvement and the people who are making toast  Others will think more about the mechanics of the toaster  What are all the parts  Other people are going to think about the whole supply chain  all the way from the grain that goes into the bread   When mental models meet system models What these are are illustrations of different people s mental models  how a person believes something works  As people have different experiences and make different assumptions and observations  they can form different mental models  Now if we look at how toast is actually made  there s four main parts  You ve got two main objects  bread and a toaster  And then you ve got heat and time which are applied to them  When you combine these together  you get the system model of making toast with a toaster  You simply put the bread into the toaster  turn it on  heat the bread  wait some time  and the toast comes out  This is what we call the system model  This is how something actually works  When you are building software  this is usually illustrated to people and delivered to them through the interface  When you have the mental model of how people believe something works  and the system model of how it actually works  it becomes interesting when these two things intersect  When they meet and make sense  people can find the interface intuitive  When things don t match and there s a disconnect  people can find it hard to use   Building products around what customers already know If people explain making toast in many different ways  then explaining something new can be really hard  People make sense of things they see by mapping them onto existing categories  When they can t map something to what they already know  they can find it confusing  Take Snapchat  Snapchat is a new product and people see it in very different ways  Some people think it s a photography app  other people think it s about augmented reality and applying filters  Some people see it as a game  and other people think it s just social sharing  But if you haven t used Snapchat before  you might have a very different mental model of what it is  You might actually be confused  Maybe it s just something that teenagers use  That s why using something new for the first time  when it doesn t map to something you already know  can be really confusing  Let s think about applying mental models  We came across this at Intercom when we were redesigning our inbox  the part of our product that businesses use to talk to their customers  We tried one design that was in a feed style  like a Facebook feed or a Twitter feed  We thought people would deal with conversations towards their friends and towards businesses in the same way  When we tested it  we found it actually didn t work  It didn t work very well with people s workflows  so we ended up building something more like this  Any of you that use Intercom will be familiar with this  But when you take a step back at how we looked at it  you see that it s informed from two existing patterns that people use   On the left  you have a list view of the conversations in your inbox  That s mirrored very closely to an email client  It s very familiar for people to use but then in the middle  you have something that looks much more like messaging  the chat bubbles back and forth  By hooking into these two existing mental models of emails and messaging  we were able to communicate to people what this product was and how they should use it to talk to their customers  How to discover mental models Now that you understand what they are  how can you actually start to understand your customer s mental models  This can be really hard  How can you extract out the beliefs they have for how something works and make it useful for yourself  The first thing you need to do is talk to your users  Like the toast example  you want to ask people to draw the system of using your product  How do they believe it works  You might be surprised when they don t list all of the features that you ve built and focus on the things that really matter to them  Just like the toast example  you ll get loads of different drawings  and you then need to synthesize them and pull out the commonalities  Get people to explain the drawings back to you  to tell you how they think it works  Listen to the words they are using  If we think about the toast example  you ll probably pull out two different mental models  two fundamental ways that people look at making toast  On the one hand  some people will make it with a toaster and other people will make it with a grill  They are just two different approaches  If you were a company that was making toasters and you had a brand new toaster with lots of different features  imagine you tried to sell that to someone who thinks about making toast in a grill  it wouldn t make sense  It wouldn t really resonate with them  That s because there s a gap in the mental models between kind of how they use something  how they believe it works  and then how your product works   You need to bridge this gap in two main ways  First you can try to make your product mirror their mental model for how they believe the product works  The other thing you can do is educate your customers  to teach them about something new and help them create new mental models  Simple is good  but products can be learned Let s talk about educating your customers  When there s something new that people don t know and they can t explain it  you need to tell them what it is and someone needs to show and explain it to them  Simple things can be really good and if you can understand something straight away  that can be really powerful  But lots of things don t work like that  and they don t have to  You ve got examples like a Pac Man controller that s really simple  or an Xbox controller  all the way up to an airplane cockpit  It doesn t mean that the cockpit needs to be as simple as the Pac Man controller  Nor should it be  But making it learnable so you can teach people how to use it is really powerful in software  So how can you do that  The easiest thing to do is with tutorials and guides  Like in video games  when you start and work your way through the first level  you start exploring and learning the world  You want to do the same thing with your customers  and teach them about what things are  Explain what the new concepts are  the new terms  Do walk throughs and talk to your customers  The other thing you can do is help make your product conform closely to their mental models  There s a few ways of doing this  At the interface level  you can use standard patterns all the time  Patterns for web or for iOS or for Android are tried and tested  and people have already learned these through using interfaces in other places  If something looks like a button  it should act like a button  If it looks like a text box  it should act like a text box  Spending your time being novel and creative in these interfaces can actually confuse customers  They spend time learning how to use patterns or interfaces when they should be spending the time learning about what your product is and the value it delivers   Use the language your customers use The next thing that s really powerful is at the content level  Most of the time people don t spend a lot of time thinking about the content and the language they put into their product  But it can be really powerful  When people are explaining how they think your product works  you want to listen to the nouns and the verbs that they use  The nouns are the objects they think are in your system  It s the language they use for them  The verbs are how they think it connects together  So if they say   Send a message   then that s the language you want to be resonating back to them  Google is a very good example of this  You ll notice all of their products are named very literally after the things that they build  Google Drive is your computer drive  Gmail is your email  Google Calendar is a calendar and so on  All these things mean that when you open them up for the first time  you know what to expect  The last thing you can use is metaphors  These can be really powerful to hook into people s existing mental models because you re piggybacking on something they ve already learned  By doing that you can help them understand something quickly  The sooner they understand what something is  the sooner they ll be able to get the value from it  Apple Wallet and Nest are interesting because they replaced very standard  physical products that people are used to using  On one side you ve got a wallet with tickets  and people are used to using physical tickets  Now  they could have designed this to have a table of QR codes  it would have done the same thing  But by making it look like physical tickets  you know how to interact with it  You know what it s going to do and you can trust the system enough to actually move away from a physical ticket into a digital one  The other example is the Nest app  It looks like a physical thermostat  and it looks like the physical Nest product thermostat as well  On my phone I can control the temperature in my house  which is in a different country by just turning the dial  Again  they could have used an interface that made this seem very complicated or different  but they used a metaphor of a physical thermostat to help people understand what it is and how to use it,"[691 488 154 561 1204 610 836 327 1390 680 529]"
693,training-dataset/product/106.txt,product,Design and the psychology of timeThe difference between design and art is that design focuses on solving problems  and art  well  art looks nice   But that s it art doesn t solve problems for our users  and in a startup heavy world  users have more pain and problems than we can even begin to accommodate   One problem all users will always have in common  time   We might be changing the world each and every day  but there s a good chance there ll always be 24 hours in a day  7 days in a week  and 52 weeks in a year  We can t create more time   Even though time is so important in design  we never dive into the psychology behind time or the perspectives our users have of their own time  After all  time is subjective  and though we ll never precisely know how someone feels about their time  we can categorize their thought process   Psychologists call this time perspective  It gives us all a better understanding of how people think  view  and value time   Here at Mikleo  time perspective has helped us  and our clients  design new features  profile personas  and clarify early stage assumptions  It s been a hidden gem in our workflow  and you need to add it to yours  Let s take a closer look at the different approaches to time perspective and how to apply them to design   Past positive and past negative  If you or someone you know spends time living in the past  then you re looking at a past positive or past negative time perspective   With a positive perspective  you ve got a rose tinted view of the past  fun  bubbly  and lots of happy experiences  With a negative perspective  it s the opposite and acts as more an anchor than a lease of life  with a focus on the not so good stuff   Past perspectives focus on remembering the experience  No matter if that experience was good or bad  users are likely to remember it vividly and for a long time   It also means that friends and family in their circles will hear about these experiences at least a few times over   Pleasing users with past perspectives doesn t require perfection just build in elements of humanity and fun  Clever animations  beautiful characterization  and anything that can add a moment of delight to your users is perfect here   News app QZ focuses on the past  and it delivers a positive experience no matter what s happening in the world  Interactions with the app are similar to texting your best friend you can respond with emojis  and all of the responses are short and easy to digest   Even the calls to action are quite delightful  Nothing within the app feels forced  and there are plenty of gentle cues to delight users  For users with a past perspective  the experience is upbeat  memorable  and incredibly human  did we mention we re fans of the emojis     Present hedonist and present fatalist  Having a present perspective means you re focused on the here and now   As a hedonist  emphasis is on short term gains and gratification  pleasure over pain  and simplicity over frustration   Fatalists believe the majority of their decisions or actions are outside of their immediate control and that others control the outcome   For present perspectives  building quick and simple gratification into designs will please even the most cynical fatalist  From badges to thank you messages  find out what adds value for your users and give it to them in a timely way  without too much heavy lifting    Snapchat is dangerously good at simple gratification  From the moment you start using the app  it s entirely focused on the most gratifying  and exciting  asset we all have  ourselves  Take pictures  customize  and send  It s a low involvement workflow that s simple to learn  Best of all  every picture you take vanishes in a matter of seconds  No need to worry about how these images could affect anything other than the here and now   Future and transcendental orientation  The reality is  thinking about the future isn t something that comes naturally to most people  Having a future perspective requires things like stability and security  If you re worried about being able to pay your rent  you won t be future focused at all   A transcendental view means you re looking to make a mark on the world and continue your legacy past your own existence   For future orientation  you need to design elements of long term value  coupled with moments of quick gratification for when things get tough   Progress tracking and reward based goals and achievements work well here  Show users how far they ve come and what they could be in the future   With their  game ified  approach to training your mind  Elevate weaves long term value for the future orientated by using comparative statistics  unlockable challenges  and a system that tracks and showcases the progress you ve made as a user   Learning is one of those catch 22 situations  You know there s long term value in dedicating your time to learning  But there are no immediate results  so when things get tough  it s easy to get stuck in the here and now   When you hit these walls  Elevate keeps up your momentum with bright colors  happy sounds  and some motivational words of wisdom   Uncovering time perspectives  Finding out which perspectives resonate with your users helps you make more informed decisions and early stage assumptions  In short  it makes life easier   That s not to say that you shouldn t cater for all time perspectives  but knowing which perspectives are most prominent will help you prioritize the work and features that ll add the most value   There are 2 ways to get the information you ll need   Passive research  looking at data  Active research  talking to people   Even if you re not involved in with the research itself  knowing what to look out for will help you contribute or  if you ever need to  do the research yourself   Passive research  Age  Use this as a minor indicator  For example  a group of teenagers is more likely to contain hedonists than a group of retirees   Marital status  Marriage implies a more future focused view  while being single or in a relationship can hint at a more present  or past focused perspective   Location  How safe are they at home  If your users are exposed to crime or violence  their time perspectives are unlikely to be future orientated   Career  Different professions focus on time in different ways  Surgeons  for instance  might need to stay past positive to avoid undue mental stress   Active  If you re interested in finding out your own time perspective  this is the test for you  It ll also give you a wealth of qualitative questions to ask users in calls or interviews   Asking your users time specific questions like  Do you do things impulsively   or  Is it important to leave a mark on the world   open up a world of knowledge  Though some of these may seem obvious  we recommend using them like a coat of white paint   Change the language and questions to suit your situation  but try to keep the sentiment the same you ll get answers you can analyze and easily assign a time perspective to   Adding time perspective to your design workflow is a game changer  Ever since we added it to ours  we ve never looked back   Read more posts by Cassius Kiani,"[693 925 25 1316 561 982 154 878 125 609 985]"
700,training-dataset/business/465.txt,business,you do not talk about pricingThe first rule of pricing is  you do not talk about pricing  I ve been slightly obsessed about pricing since 2010  Before joining Fluxx  I was part of the team that changed the price of The Times digital edition from this   The Times digital price pre 2010  To this   The Times digital price post 2010  Introducing what inevitably became know as  The Times Paywall  or  Rupert s Pathetic Paywall  inspired a powerful reaction  with plenty of headlines like this one   Explain it again  Mike  I m not sure how you feel   Techdirt   Even Gordon Brown   then Prime Minister and fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan   took time out to share his views on pricing strategy   People have got used to getting content without having to pay   he said   There s a whole sort of element of communication that s got to be free    In the end  of course  it turned out that charging people money for a product they enjoyed wasn t a terrible way to do business   This happened a  long  time after I left The Times  Campaign   Prices are interesting because they inspire such strong emotions  Responding to price is hard wired into our brains  When we see something expensive  we know immediately   without thinking   that it isn t for us   That can trigger a whole range of powerful  feelings  envy  anger  admiration  disappointment  lust  disgust  hatred  excitement  It s a potent brew   Picture  Along the Trail  The opposite is also true  When we see a mountain of tea lights in IKEA with a sign saying  Glimma 100 pack  3 99   only one human response is possible   Ooh  that s a lot of tea lights  We probably need some tea lights  don t we  I ll just put those in my yellow bag    It s not a conscious decision  but an animal response to a pricing signal   At other times  our response to pricing is absurdly complicated  tangled and self obsessed   Ordering wine is a social  psychological and economic roller coaster  In France  they draw huge excel spreadsheets onto the walls of their restaurants   The wine list at Philou in Paris  via Not Drinking Poison   When they re not discussing philosophy or plotting affairs  the customers engage with these arbitrarily sorted spreadsheets to buy wine   You can t buy the first wine on the list  because you ll feel like an ignorant cheapskate   So you look at the second wine  But  as a sophisticated Medium reader  you re well aware that the second wine on the list is the most popular  so the restaurateur will ensure it is also the most profitable   You don t want to be suckered into buying the most profitable wine on the list  so you trick the restaurant by actually buying a more expensive wine   It s a minefield    Here s a great piece by Ryan Opaz about the baffling psychology of Wine    Prices are a shortcut to our most sensitive emotional responses   The smirking face of price sensitivity is  of course  Martin Shkreli   Martin pushes every pricing button   He bought a  9 000 bottle of wine  and tweeted the label   He bought the only copy of Wu Tang Clan s album  Once Upon a Time in Shaolin  for  2m  then said  I ll probably never even hear it  I just thought it would be funny to keep it from people    Most famously  he raised the price of a life saving drug from  13 50 to  750 per tablet   People had strong emotional reactions to this pricing decision    Interesting pieces on Martin Shkreli here and here    Pricing strategy is a huge part of many businesses  but   in the world of product and service design   it s relatively rarely discussed  There was no panel at SXSW 2016 discussing pricing strategy   Instead  we tend to admire simple  universal pricing models   Netflix is  5 99 a month for anything you want to watch  It s simple  clear and transparent   Except   Netflix doesn t have simple pricing anymore  It has a range of prices  from  5 99 for one person to  8 99 for four people simultaneously streaming HD video   I don t think anyone at Netflix expects people to actually pay  8 99 for a house full of people glued to their screens  But the  8 99 price makes the  7 49 price seem more credible  With 70m subscribers  it s worth trying    The full story of Netflix pricing is in this great article by Derek Thompson  which inspired this piece    The importance of price to a company should be obvious  At The Times  we realised that converting customers who paid  8 week for the printed newspaper into customers paying  2 week for the digital edition  often after paying Apple  500 for an iPad on which to read the edition  wasn t great business   So   over two years   we gradually raised the price for those original customers to  6 week  At that price  we could be genuinely agnostic  We didn t mind if a customer was digital or analogue  the contribution was the same  Of the original core customers regularly paying  2 week  we only lost around 10  during the price rises  many other customers came and went during that time  but for loyal customers the alternative was an  8 week print habit    The first rule of pricing is that you don t talk about pricing   It s tempting to talk to customers about price   Your customers   real or potential   will certainly have views about prices that they are keen to share   Ignore them    It is not your customer s job to set pricing  An optimal price is one that is accepted but not without some initial resistance  says Ash Mauyra explains in this great piece   It is almost impossible to predict how a customer will react to a particular price by asking them  That s because they don t know how they will react   They have no idea    Are you in the market for tea lights on this trip to IKEA   you might ask   No  They might say  Or  Yes   Neither is a useful signal  because they don t have a clue   There s one easy way to find out what customers think about prices  By selling them things   The second rule of pricing is that you don t think about pricing  As human beings find it almost impossible to think rationally around pricing  Because of this  as human beings  our own thoughts about pricing are likely to be almost useless   When Turing Pharmaceutical raised the price of Daraprim from  13 50 to  750  they could have seen a 98 1  drop in sales   and still made more money   When The Times introduced a paywall  the number of people looking at their digital service dropped by 98 7   from 22m to around 300 000   yet the switch was a huge financial success   Those kind of shifts are hard to make sense of rationally   so the flood of emotional reactions takes over   The third rule of pricing is that experiments are the only way to make sense of it all  One classic pricing experiment was conducted in early  80s by Joel Huber and Christopher Puto at Duke University in North Carolina   Their paper  Adding Asymmetrically Dominated Alternatives  Violations of Regularity and the Similarity Hypothesis  outlines the experiments they did to understand how college kids buy beer  and televisions  cars  restaurants  lottery tickets  and film    The results of their experiment are still obvious almost every time you buy something online   They started with two types of beer  cheap and expensive   70  chose the more expensive variety   Next  they added a decoy cheap beer   Remarkably  none of the students chose the cheap beer  but it s presence on the shelf distorted the entire market  pulling the centre of pricing gravity downwards   Finally  they introduced a premium beer   Which had the opposite effect  skewing the entire market upwards  and significantly improving the revenue from the original experiment   The lesson has been learned  and  Good  Better  Best  pricing strategies are everywhere  from Slack   To British Gas   The lesson isn t that you must have three prices  but that searching for one perfect price is likely to be less effective than finding a sensible range of prices   It s reminiscent of Malcolm Gladwell s story of the futility of searching for the perfect spaghetti sauce   where the punchline is  Prego turned to Howard  and they said   You re telling me that one third of Americans crave extra chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs   And he said  Yes       Apple have fully embraced Good  Better Best pricing  building layers of recursive GBB into their product line  First you chose your phone   Then you choose your memory   Is  1 60 a good price for an extra GB of memory on your phone  It s hard to tell   People can t tell you what they think about pricing  because they don t think about pricing  They feel it   A couple of years ago  Fluxx had a client with a huge customer base paying relatively small recurring payments  They asked us to help them think about membership and loyalty schemes   One idea was to create a premium loyalty scheme  where customers would pay a little extra each month for access to rewards   This raised a few obvious questions  Would anyone pay  How much would they pay  What rewards would they pay for   Over a few days  we rolled out a simple experiment  We sent a note like this to a sample of customers   The actual email was a split test on price  and was slightly less crappy looking   The idea was to write an email that felt real  not one that felt like a survey  We weren t asking customers what they thought about a price  but how they d personally react to a change that was coming  The email went down pretty well  with a 10  response rate  and the results were startling   51  of customers who were offered rewards for  2 accepted the offer  In most cases  this would nearly double their monthly spend   37  accepted at  4  and 31  accepted at  6  potentially almost tripling the amount they spent with the company   Considering that one  6 customer would contribute the same as three  2 customers  the results were very encouraging   With this one simple experiment  the conversation shifted from  Would anyone really pay for this   to  I wonder what we could offer for  8 month    Price is the crudest  and most subtle  message you can send about your product  so it s worth getting it right   Running experiments is the best way to achieve that   This is a version of a talk given at the first Experiments in Design Meetup in London in April 2016  Signup and come to

721,training-dataset/business/1037.txt,business,On Receiving  and Truly Hearing  Radical CandorKim Scott wanted to stay home in the morning long enough to have breakfast with her young twins  So she did the logical thing   she sent an email to her team asking if they could start their morning meeting an hour later   I expected people to pat me on the back for being an awesome new mom   she says   Instead  I got one of the most painful criticisms ever    This was when she was heading up AdSense Online Sales and Operations for Google   a huge global team  Shortly after pressing send  she got a response from a member of the Dublin team to the effect of  Some of us have children too  and now we re going to be late for dinner  The time change hadn t occurred to Scott  who had no idea how to respond   It was incredibly difficult not to react defensively  All I could do was stay silent  count to 6 and apologize    Getting pointed feedback isn t easy for anyone  And it can be even harder for managers who rarely receive it once they get to a certain level  But being able to not just take  but truly hear and understand Radical Candor   as Scott has now virally defined it and expands on in her new book   is one of the most important skills you can learn in your career   Today  Scott has teamed up with former fellow Googler Russ Laraway to co found Candor Inc   a software and content company helping companies of all sizes make authentic  constructive feedback a cornerstone of their cultures  Scott and Laraway have both written and spoken often on how to give Radical Candor to colleagues  In this exclusive article  they turn the tables and focus on how to listen   As a refresher  here s Scott talking about Radical Candor at last year s First Round CEO Summit   YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR CRITICISM  Especially if you re a leader  you can t expect other people to be proactive about giving you feedback  They re busy  They don t want to offend  They don t want to get on your bad side  And even if you re an individual contributor  you might be starved for guidance  Your manager might be afraid to hurt morale  or has nothing top of mind  or doesn t prioritize it  It s up to you to get the information you need   As a manager  asking for feedback is a powerful opportunity to lead by example that will have ripple effects  By asking repeatedly and consistently for criticism  you seem much more receptive and people are more likely to say things  On top of that  you make everyone in your org more comfortable with receiving and therefore giving criticism because it s not cast as negative or damaging   Asking for criticism can manifest itself in different ways   either indirectly or directly  The best tack is to do both   Asking Indirectly for Feedback  It s possible to foster an atmosphere where criticism is rebranded as a gift you give or a service you do for someone else  says Scott   One of the best ways to ask for criticism is to share the criticism you ve already received   For instance  Michelle Peluso and several other CEOs are known to email their own 360 performance reviews to the entire company  This accomplishes two things  It makes it clear they are open to and grateful for feedback  and that there s no reason to hide even the worst mistakes  And it gives everyone at the company the ability to chime in and have a stake in how the leadership works   At Google  Scott used to ask her reports who criticized her privately to restate their thoughts in public meetings  Laraway in particular was very good at this  bringing a certain theatricality to the proceedings that really commanded attention    There s this rule we ve all accepted that you must criticize in private  but when you re the boss  you re the exception to the rule   she says   You want people to see how you ll react   that you can take it and will appreciate it    Kim Scott  You want to make acceptance of your own mistakes as visible as possible to create a culture of healthy feedback  she says  At one point  a member of her team offered her feedback and she responded poorly  holding onto her point of view  When she realized she was indeed wrong  she took a large crystal statue from her office and gave it to the employee  saying   This is my you were right and I was wrong gift to you   Whenever anyone asked about the statue   and they always did   they got to hear the story and Scott s open attitude toward feedback was part of it    You have to work really hard and really consistently to get criticism free flowing up and down and sideways through your team   says Laraway   As soon as you have one convert who is willing to give you Radical Candor  treat them like gold  Create a network effect that gets you more feedback    In his experience  you have to dedicate yourself to getting that first person to finally open up and say something surprisingly candid about you  their manager  in front of the team  You have to go above and beyond to make it acceptable  and even championed  So when it happens  you have to reward the bravery with an incredibly warm response   Think about how much energy it takes for someone to offer tough criticism to their boss  If you mess up receiving it even one time  that s it  You might not get feedback again for a while   Eventually  the goal is to parlay this positivity you generate with your responses into helping everyone on your team recognize and freely admit to their own mistakes   after all  socializing self criticism makes it healthier and more actionable  One of the best ways to do this is to start a light hearted yet consistent ritual where people are often rewarded for this tough brand of honesty    In our old AdSense All Hands meetings  we d ask people to stand up and talk about a mistake they had made over the last week   and whoever had messed up the worst would get a stuffed animal we named Whoops the Monkey   says Laraway   The winner of Whoops would get to choose their successor the following week and so on    It sounds like a game  but the group was more than skeptical at first  No one wanted to cop to a mistake  much less give a little spiel about it   We even told people that if you share at all hands  you get instant forgiveness   and you have the incentive of helping all of your teammates avoid the same mistake   says Scott  Still  it was like pulling teeth   until she put a  20 bill on Whoops  head   It s like the money gave people plausible deniability   they could say they were only sharing for the money  but that wasn t it  It just broke the ice    Eventually  the Whoops ceremony caught on  People saw no negative consequences for sharing  only a lot of support and encouragement  Soon  whenever that portion of the meeting came up  there d be volunteers at the ready  As a result  everyone got to learn from each other s pitfalls  it made it safe to fail which fostered more innovation  and they got to post mortem projects with greater honesty and depth  Most importantly  it made it easier for people to criticize their peers   perhaps the most difficult thing to do   because criticism itself had been defanged   Create a culture where everyone knows criticism is about helping each other do the best work of their careers   Asking Directly for Feedback   On one of my past teams  there was a woman who kept getting passed over for promotions  She knew it but didn t know why   says Laraway   The reason hadn t been given to her but was discussed behind her back    This is the kind of behavior that muddies cultures and weakens trust among teams  To make sure this doesn t happen to you and the people you work with  develop what Laraway calls a  Go To Question    Your Go To Question is designed to get at what s happening in a way that s easier because it s non confrontational  inquisitive  and reframes what people say as a positive    Bill Berry at Tacoma Power is known for being a really thoughtful manager  and part of it was he would get people to tell him what they were really thinking   says Laraway   He d do this by saying to them   Give me some advice   Then he d just wait  He d wait forever  And eventually  he d hear all kinds of stuff that surprised him and made him and the organization better    By re casting any criticism as advice  he made people feel helpful  And the silence made it clear he was invested in what people had to say   Another variation I ve heard from other leaders is   Is there something I could do differently to make it easier to work with me     Your Go To Question could also be in the form of a hypothesis that greases the wheels    Let s say I have a hunch that I m not doing something well   says Laraway   When I state it as a fact to one of my reports  I give them an in  Like I might say   I imagine that you having to constantly chase me down to review those reports is frustrating     If it is in fact frustrating  that person has clear runway to say so now  This can be great if you have some more timid people on your team  You re offering them a straw man  and even language to use to talk about it    If you re having trouble getting feedback  start with being self critical and give someone a chance to agree   As a leader you have to be constantly vigilant of openings to encourage criticism of your work  A big part of this is reminding yourself over and over again how valuable and necessary this feedback is  Turn a past instance of receiving feedback into a touchstone that keeps this top of mind for you   For Scott  it s the time one of her colleagues called her on her penchant to fire off emails without thinking through the consequences  For a while  she d dash off terse notes for expediency  not realizing they caused massive anxiety for their recipients  Until one day she got a note back   You re awfully fast to hit send  Kim     That stung  but he was exactly right   she says   I haven t talked to him in years now  but at least once a week when I m about to press send  I think of that comment and it saves me from myself  It s made me more aware of how much I genuinely need those kinds of comments    EMBRACE THE DISCOMFORT  Borrowed from Intel CEO Andy Grove   Embrace the discomfort  is a vital mantra for anyone who wants Radical Candor from their colleagues    There s a false assumption that making people comfortable will make it easier for them to criticize you  but that s not the case   says Scott   When you ask someone who works with you or for you for criticism  just accept that you ve put them in an extremely uncomfortable position    Trying to make it better isn t doing either of you any favors  So don t jump in to cut them off  or make it easier in some way  Drive home the fact that you need their thoughts to get better at your job  and don t let awkwardness get in the way    When I taught at Apple University  I would often ask rooms full of people what they thought about me  and I would count to 6 before jumping in to say something else  I d just let the question hang out there   says Scott   You ll be shocked how long that is  Most people can t endure the silence  Someone will say something    Early on  the Toyota Motor Company took an even more stringent approach  They painted a big red box at the end of every assembly line  and had new employees stand in it  They weren t allowed to leave the box until they had said something critical about the company s operations  This was deeply uncomfortable given standard treatment of authority  so extreme measures had to be taken   Michael Dearing  founder of Harrison Metal  took a softer approach when he led product marketing at eBay  He set an orange box in a high traffic area of the office and told people to drop criticisms and questions and pointed comments into it whenever they thought of something  Then he would pull them out at the all hands without previewing any of them and answer authentically off the cuff  He had to embrace his own discomfort and respond positively to whatever came up   Soon people seeing the easy way he accepted candor would just come up and volunteer their thoughts in person  The more the behavior was rewarded  the more people offered up ways to improve   Laraway observed a similar effect at Twitter during his team s monthly business reviews  The first time they asked people to surface what wasn t working well  they only got superficial remarks designed to tiptoe around others  feelings  It took a few months to get to a point where people dug into what had really happened and why  And they got there through sheer persistence   We just wouldn t stop telling people the mission of the meeting was to get to the real critical nitty gritty of what was broken   he says   As a team we had to just be uncomfortable together repeatedly and not give up    Russ Laraway  ALWAYS REWARD THE CANDOR  This harkens back to Laraway s point  You have to treat the first people who freely criticize you like gold  In fact  you have to treat everyone who does like gold  always   but those first couple are important to reward in particular  They re capable of turning the tide in favor of feedback   A while ago at Candor  he suggested a product change in a meeting and met zero resistance  A week later  they met again and the change hadn t been made  When he asked why  one of the engineers finally admitted   We thought that was a terrible idea   Yes  he waited before saying it  but he said it    I knew this guy loved coffee  so I bought him a Starbucks gift card and wrote on it   That s a terrible idea    says Laraway   I followed up with an email thanking him for saying what he really thought  Later  he told me he really appreciated the leeway to say things  even if they were impulsive    Never ever criticize the criticism  Just say thank you    You have to listen with the intent to understand   says Scott   Don t interrupt  Don t cross examine    One thing that hobbles managers in receiving feedback is a facet of how they give it  Managers  more than anyone  feel burdened to give people examples when they offer criticism  They don t want to just say   Hey you re inarticulate in meetings   they re drilled to say   You could have expressed yourself more clearly last Thursday when you said X    This training gets in the way when someone gives them feedback and their knee jerk response is to ask for specific examples   It s really hard when someone tells you you did something wrong to not say   when did that happen   or  what makes you say that    says Scott   This makes you sound defensive  like you re disagreeing  like you re trying to poke holes in their argument  Especially if you outrank the person  you re basically saying   Where s the evidence of that     The truth is  it s very hard to cite exact examples when you re put on the spot  People are often very good at pinpointing how they feel about a co workers performance  but have a difficult time explaining or remembering what led them to that conclusion  If you press on this  you re not rewarding the candor  and you re robbing yourself of future feedback   On the contrary  you could say   Oh I see  So if I did X  Y  and Z differently  that would help you in A  B and C ways  am I right   You not only demonstrate that you heard and understand them  you re getting them to agree with you  which kicks off positively framed dialogue   Another way Scott has avoided this trap is encouraging her co workers to give her tough  candid feedback right away   almost instantaneously  For a while  she even wore a rubber band around her wrist that any of her colleagues could snap when she interrupted them  It helped her break the habit   If you store up all this feedback for one on ones or performance reviews  you re going to fall into asking people for examples they can t give you  And you re oddly depriving them of data they could use to get better until an arbitrary date on the calendar  Give everyone permission to offer impromptu feedback to dramatically increase the amount of information being exchanged   GIVE AS GOOD AS YOU WANT TO GET  Receiving helpful Radical Candor will only happen if you give it too  As a leader  it s your responsibility to set the tone for this by delivering effective feedback yourself  And usually this boils down to a mindset shift    Really ask yourself why you pull your punches when you re giving feedback  Is your empathy actually productive or are you just trying to spare someone s feelings   says Laraway   You can t control how other people are going to feel no matter what  All you can do is tell them you re trying to help them grow  and remind them that human beings learn much more from criticism than praise    Give criticism in person as often as possible  Don t skimp on this  Much of communication is non verbal  So if you re just a disembodied voice over the phone telling them they did X and Y wrong  you re missing most of the interaction  There s no way for you to really understand how they re receiving what you re saying  if they re hurt or confused  You have no way to gauge whether you should dial your comments up or down   The clarity of your feedback is measured at the other person s ear  not your mouth    People focus so much on how they re saying something  that they spend 0 time considering what the other person is actually hearing them say   says Scott   When someone is engaged  they lean in  When they re shutting down  they cross their arms and distance themselves   I feel like we re very attuned to these basic signals in our personal lives but then fail to bring that to work with us  If you have all this data about how you re being heard  you can be nimble  rephrase  consider sharing something else   In short  don t fly blind if you can help it   Lastly on this point  don t let praise be the area where you ruin your credibility  Both Scott and Laraway have seen this happen too many times  A manager wants to heap on the positive reinforcement  but there s so many ways that can go wrong    If you re a boss and you say one thing that sounds sort of off or indicates that you don t know what s truly going on   you lose more than you stood to gain in the first place   says Laraway   Like if I complimented my content manager on a blog instead of a video  Or on the email campaign she sent Thursday when it was really out on Tuesday  You erode confidence in yourself    The further from the front line work you are  the more careful you have to be about details in both praise and criticism  People trusting that you re familiar with their work and that you know what you re talking about is everything  A quick fix is to not just praise what was done  but to go the extra mile to tell the person and the team exactly what impact the work will have   RELY ON RITUALS   So many people today talk about building  learning cultures  where people can openly talk about their errors and ways to improve   says Laraway   Without actual  everyday blocking and tackling tactics in place  nothing will change  You have to establish triggers and rituals for yourself and your team to bring feedback to the surface    Small rituals split the difference between nothing and elaborate systems and process  The key is to make these rituals lightweight enough that they don t take up any significant time  make sure they recur regularly  and make them gimmicky  or quirky  or memorable  whatever you prefer   Whoops the Monkey is a prime example  The more goofy or odd you make these triggers  the more abstracted feedback will be from negative feelings   and the harder they will be to forget to do    Don t create more process  Create rituals that fit seamlessly into what you already do every day   says Scott   Having people pass around a stuffed animal at the end of a meeting once a week didn t take time out of our days  But even now when I think about that monkey  I remember how important it is to ask for feedback  react well to it  and be present and conscious of opportunities to use it    Photographs courtesy of Candor  Inc  and art

723,training-dataset/business/1090.txt,business,How MailChimp Is Evolving to Dominate a Larger MarketBy  On paper  MailChimp shouldn t be a sexy company   They ve never raised venture capital   They re based in Atlanta  a world away from Silicon Valley   Oh yeah  and their company helps businesses use everyone s favorite marketing channel to hate email   But with 14 million customers   400 million in revenue in 2016  and an intoxicating brand that gives even the biggest email curmudgeons the warm  n  fuzzies  they re not only a  very  sexy company they re a great example for any company that aspires to build a brand customers love   Because of that  marketers have learned it s worth paying attention to how and why MailChimp does the things they do   So when they made a move last month that I believe will  long term  have a major impact on the entire landscape of email marketing tools  I figured it was worth paying attention to exactly what they re doing   I m talking about the release of their new Facebook Ad Campaigns feature  which allows users to create  launch  and track Facebook ad campaigns within their MailChimp account with zero added cost   Pretty cool  right  If you re a MailChimp user  you no longer have to try to make sense of Facebook s ever morphing ad manager interface   But what s really interesting are the long term implications this move has for MailChimp as a company and the subtle  yet major  ways MailChimp has already begun shifting their copy  positioning  and product   The long term implications are pretty clear to anyone who has seen the press MailChimp has gotten over the past few months   For example  look at the subheadline of the article Fast Company wrote about the Facebook Ad Campaigns launch     wants to be a one stop shop for online marketing    Hmmmm this might not be just another feature release   Instead  it could be an early step toward an entire new identity for the nearly 17 year old company   TechCrunch s Frederic Lardinois expanded on this further    MailChimp wants to become a holistic marketing platform for businesses  and I would expect that at some point in this process  it ll change its name to reflect that     Whoa   And finally  MailChimp CEO Ben Chestnut even told the New York Times that the company s next phase is to become a  one stop shop for the entirety of a small business s marketing needs  in this fun read from Farhad Manjoo   He also tweeted this when Fast Company named them one of the most innovative companies of 2017   Whether you re a MailChimp customer or not  if you have any experience with online marketing for small businesses  you know their brand is a giant in the market  Changing their name would be a huge deal   That s when it hit me if this Facebook feature release is the first step in a brand shifting move for MailChimp  it could present a fascinating opportunity to see how an extremely loved brand approaches a challenge many businesses must face at some point   How do you evolve your company to reach more customers without risking what s made you successful in the first place   Brand Repositioning  How Do You Do It Without Squandering Your Existing Market   I may be talking about a business that brought in over  400 million last year  but brand repositioning isn t a challenge that s unique to big companies  There are early stage startups and even single person freelance operations that go through it all the time    I m currently known for doing X  but doing Y is a huge growth opportunity  How do I pursue Y without losing X    How do you communicate that you now offer this shiny new thing without alienating the people who love you for the old reliable thing you built your brand on   MailChimp may still be years away from having more than just email as their central focus and core messaging  but there are three specific things they ve already done that I think offer some lessons to any business wondering how to navigate the perils of repositioning   They made smart changes to their home page copy  They integrated the Facebook Ad Campaigns feature into their core product beautifully  They launched a bizarrely funny marketing campaign that perfectly fits their brand  and might just be the biggest hint of all of a massive change coming to the company    In this post  I m going to analyze how they ve done all three and revealed what I think is a smart approach to brand repositioning   We ll start with  1  the home page   1  MailChimp s Biggest Headline Change in Over 5 Years  In June of 2013  this was MailChimp s home page headline   Send better email   Simple  straightforward  and a promise that actually meant something to visitors since MailChimp had spent more than a decade building a reputation that backed it up   Before  Send better email   it had been something fairly similar for a few years   Easy email newsletters   The bottom line  Since the company launched  its positioning had been 100  about email   Big surprise for a company with  Mail  in the name  right    But in 2016  something changed  It would have been hard to notice immediately  but the first sign of brand repositioning appeared when they launched a feature called Product Recommendations a second sentence joined the  Send better email  headline   Send better email  Sell more stuff   Not only is this the first headline to speak to something other than email  it s the first specific mention of the benefit of increasing sales in their home page s history that I can find   And I m a pretty deft user of the Internet Archive Wayback Machine  That s right deft    But if you look closer  you ll notice this was more than just a headline change  They also showcased that brand new feature  Product Recommendations  in the home page s primary CTA area   Not coincidentally  Product Recommendations was a feature that tied directly into the  Sell more stuff  promise   And if you look even closer  you ll notice the way they describe what their customers use MailChimp to do aligns with the  sell more stuff  promise as well    Join 12 million people who use MailChimp to connect with their customers and grow their business every day    This is considerably different from how they described the way customers use MailChimp right before the feature launch and headline change    Join more than 10 million people who use MailChimp to design and send 600 million emails every day    Just like the old headline  it was only focused on sending email  It relied solely on their position as a market leader in email marketing to persuade visitors to sign up   But now that they re focusing on being known for more than just email  things become more complex which is why they ve made even bigger changes with the launch of the Facebook Ad Campaigns feature   The home page s job is now to educate visitors specifically on how it can help them grow  With more features  they ve added more copy  including an entire section on how you can use MailChimp to sell more stuff   An entire section that doesn t mention email something that s pretty unprecedented in the history of the company s home page   But the next section  which is dedicated to the new Facebook Ad Campaigns feature  makes an even bolder move   Look at that first line again  Do you see the bold move    You need more than one channel to reach every audience    For its entire history  MailChimp had focused on being the best at one channel email  As we ve seen  their copy has been singularly focused on it for over a decade   But things have changed  While email is still the most effective way for most businesses to reach customers online  there are other great channels too  Rather than resisting the tides of change  MailChimp is grabbing a paddle   They re not only offering a tool to utilize another great channel  Facebook   they re making sure small business owners know that focusing on only one channel isn t even enough anymore   This may seem like a minor addition  but when you consider how they ve positioned themselves historically  it s easy to see just how radically different this is for the company   There are several other sections that provide details on MailChimp s automation and analytics features  but I want to skip ahead to the page s final call to action  which I think is pretty revealing    MailChimp gives you the marketing tools to be yourself on a bigger stage    They could have chosen to lead with a line like this  but they saved it for the end of the page  Why  Because they know there s an endless number of SaaS platforms trying to position themselves as a suite of marketing tools that will help your business grow right now   Rather than leading with that  MailChimp is still capitalizing on what makes them stand out their position as a leader in email marketing   That s why this is still the first feature section of the page   Before they tell you about all the fancy new features that will help your business grow  they lead with their bread and butter   This is a theme that is echoed in the next phase of their smart  measured evolution the way the Facebook Ad Campaigns feature is actually integrated into the product   2  MailChimp Is Evolving Its Product Without Losing Its Familiarity  The introduction of Facebook Ad Campaigns  and simultaneous brand repositioning  could have been seen as an opportunity for MailChimp to completely rethink their user interface and experience   They could have taken a big  bold step toward making users see them as an all in one marketing solution   At the very least  they could have given Facebook advertising its own section in the app   They didn t do any of that   The first time I logged in to check out the new feature  it took me a while to find it  First  I had to click the  Campaigns  tab   One I was in my Campaigns dashboard  there still wasn t anything about Facebook ads until I clicked the  Create Campaign  button and then clicked the  Campaign type  dropdown menu   At first  I thought they d kind of buried the feature  But then I realized that this was probably a smart idea for two reasons   1  It s in a familiar context   Creating a Facebook ad can be intimidating  especially if it s your first time  By putting the feature in the same area users create their email campaigns  they ve made it way more approachable  It s a subtle way of saying   If you can create an email campaign in MailChimp  you can create a Facebook ad campaign too    2  Users will find it through regular habits   Despite all the press and announcements made about the Facebook ads feature  the reality is that the majority of users still won t know it exists  By placing it in what I m guessing is the average user s most frequent activity  creating an email campaign   they can discover it in a way that fits with their existing habits   This is MailChimp s way of changing without making users feel like they re really changing   The product is growing up  but it s skipping those awkward teenage years so many tools go through those times when it feels like a product is just throwing new features in your face and burying the stuff you actually use it for   3  The Pretty Damn Weird  Perfectly MailChimpy Marketing Campaign That Assures You the Brand You Know and Love Will Endure  Despite a Little Repositioning   I first noticed that something a weird was going on with MailChimp when I started seeing cryptic tweets like this one from their director of design   When you click that link  you re taken to a search results page on the MailChimp website for the term  failchips   complete with an animation of chips raining down from the search bar   Then I stumbled upon this minute long short film about a singing shrimp sandwich they ve been promoting  titled MailShrimp   And last week I even got a notification that CEO Ben Chestnut had made a related addition to his Twitter bio  highlighted in green    Once I paid another visit to their home page I started to get to the bottom of this   At the top of the page  a slide in banner appeared introducing the company with a rotating variety of other nonsensical names like   KaleLimp  NailChamp  WhaleSynth  MaleCrimp  and more  When you click on it  you go to a page that reveals more details about the marketing campaign  I underlined a few parts worth paying special attention   Okay  now we re onto something   There are three reasons I think MailChimp might have for basing an entire marketing campaign around poking fun at their name   They re hinting that a name change is coming     we re not so concerned with what people call us   They re showing that their name doesn t really define what they do anymore that it s more about their brand than the product itself   Which would make sense if they re planning on not changing the name even though they re moving beyond email   Or maybe it s all just for fun and I m reading too much into it      UPDATE  Ben Chestnut let me know that a name change is not currently the plan   Regardless which of these reasons it turns out to be  or not be   I think what s really at work here is the idea that the evolution of your business doesn t have to be such a scary  uncomfortable thing   Rather than leaving the process to a bunch of executives wringing their hands behind closed doors  MailChimp is letting their customers in on the process in a way that s consistent with the fun  whimsical brand they ve worked so hard to craft   If they re going to change their name  they re ramping up to it in the most MailChimpy way possible   I think it s their way of telling customers that  ultimately  it doesn t matter if the name changes or stays the same they ll still be the same company you ve grown to love  whether they re called MailChimp  MailShrimp  or something totally different   The MailChimp Formula for Brand Repositioning the Smart Way  Other than showing you that I think MailChimp is going through a fascinating evolution right now  I want to point out a few lessons that I think are useful to anyone thinking of repositioning their brand   1  You can evolve your product and maybe even change your name without changing the core of what makes you great   Ask yourself why do people love your product  brand  and company   Are the things you just listed incompatible with the direction in which you d like to move   In most cases  I believe the answer will be no  The core of why your company exists often goes beyond the constraints of a single product   MailChimp may have started out as a way for small business owners to easily send well designed emails  but it s become a lot more than that  They even pointed this out in the blog post announcing the Facebook Ad Campaigns feature     Our customers tell us that MailChimp helps them look pro and grow   says our CEO  Ben Chestnut   It s not an email platform  it s not a newsletter tool it s the thing that helps them look more professional  That insight gave us a feeling of liberation  We don t just have to do email  So we began talking to customers with that in mind     Sure  there are probably practical reasons why people love your product   It makes sending email really easy    but there are also emotional ones   It makes me look awesome     When you discover those emotional ones  you ll find there s often much more you could be doing to fulfill them   2  Repositioning doesn t have to happen in a single event it can be a process   It s tempting to think you have to initiate big changes with a reset button   A big  massive  all at once change seems like a good way to get attention  But it also risks alienating the customers who already know and love you   Baby steps can be bold too  That s why we freak out when babies take them   There are ways to start small  Maybe it s introducing a single new feature  Maybe it s a change to the way you position yourself on your home page  Maybe it s a shift in your content strategy   That s why I like the simple  Sell more stuff  addition to MailChimp s headline  It clearly communicates where the product is going without abandoning what is still very much the core feature   Like I said  MailChimp is probably still years away from becoming a legitimate  all in one  marketing solution for small business  But that doesn t mean they can t start steering the ship in that direction now   You don t have to leap without looking  Scorched earth style changes are not required to be made to your copy   3  You can let customers in on the process   Once you ve decided to reposition  don t act like it s a big secret   Being open about the move is a great opportunity to let existing customers know you re not abandoning them  while also letting the prospects you re trying to attract know that you now provide the things they re looking for   The MailChimp blog post I mentioned earlier is a great example of this  Check out this paragraph    When we interviewed customers about what they wanted  they were clear  take the MailChimp magic to other marketing channels   We listened  and that s why we chose Facebook as our next marketing channel  After email  Facebook ads are the next most popular choice with our customers for acquiring customers and generating revenue   says Tom Klein  CMO   We created an ad buying experience that feels like MailChimp  so customers can create beautiful ads quickly and get back to building their business   In just a few steps  you can create ads  set your targeting  and decide your budget  And if you re already comfortable with MailChimp s interface  you ll feel right at home    If you re open and transparent  you can get customers just as excited as your are  You can do this in a straightforward way  like the above paragraph   and in fun ways  like the MailShrimp campaign    Let your customers inform the process and you might be surprised  and even delighted  at where they lead you   Are these three brand repositioning lessons universally true   Of course not   The reasons brands have for repositioning aren t always the same  and neither are the circumstances   But I think they re interesting guidelines to consider within the context of your business s unique situation  Some may apply  some may not   At the very least  they ll get you asking questions worth answering   On that note  what do you think of the steps MailChimp has taken so far  and what do you think other brands can learn from them  Perhaps most importantly  what will this mean for Freddie    Drop a comment below and let s chat about it,"[723 814 511 154 936 1189 782 561 327 609 51]"
736,training-dataset/business/255.txt,business,The Goldilocks Effect and How to Harness Social InfluenceAbout the time Jonah Berger was wrapping up graduate school  his father asked about his latest research  Berger said that he was studying social influence  His father started lamenting its effect on his peers   DC lawyers are such conformists   his dad said   They make partner and the first thing they all do is go out and buy a new BMW   Berger paused   But  Dad  aren t you a DC lawyer  And don t you actually drive a BMW   His father replied   Yeah  but they all drive gray ones and I drive a blue one    Even after years of research  Berger is surprised at how people   his own kin included   are so quick to identify the effects of social influence on others  but fail to see those same influences at work on themselves  A Wharton professor and bestselling author of Contagious and Invisible Influence  Berger has spent over 15 years studying how social influence works and how it leads products  services and ideas to catch on  His work has been featured in major publications and applied to drive product strategy and adoption for Fortune 500 companies and startups alike   In this exclusive interview  Berger deconstructs the drivers behind social influence in the startup world and offers why we should influence   and are influenced   by increment  He offers ways to apply this practice internally  such as for performance evaluations  and for more external  public endeavors like product launches  Lastly  he suggests a few habits that can help individuals manage and leverage social influence in the workplace   What Happens When Influence Is Invisible  People are often unaware of how influence affects them because it happens unconsciously or beyond our awareness  We can t see it  Precisely because it s invisible  there are often two visceral reactions   It happens to others  but not to me  or  It happens to me and I don t trust it   To Berger  influence is neither discriminatory nor deceptive in and of itself  everyone is influenced and that s not necessarily a bad thing    Take my dad and his BMW   Berger says   First  he felt he made a choice based on personal preference  but his inclination was really shaped by his environment  He bought the same brand that others in his peer group were buying  but a different color to stand out  Second  while we commonly think of influence as imitation or being the same as others  choosing to be different is being influenced as well  And third  influence isn t just about being the same or different  We often declare our identity by doing both at the same time  behaving in ways that simultaneously let us fit in and stand out  Our choices   and ourselves   are a fusion of influences    Influence is not a one grape varietal  It s always a blend   Disruption Gets Funds  Familiarity Rallies Users  In a startup world that idolizes iconoclasts  there s an immediate gravitation toward disruption and differentiation  That s not a bad instinct according to Berger  but it s not the whole story  The byproduct of this default is that most downplay   and dangerously neglect   the level of influence of others on organizations    In venture backed markets especially  there s a premium placed on being disruptive  There s no sweeter sound to investors  ears than  We re going to change the way it s done forever   For companies raising capital  it s smart for founders to frame their startup as disruptive   says Berger   But  when it comes to customers  being different doesn t always work  People like things that feel familiar  that are easy to adopt  A product or service that is distant from what they re used to and have engaged with in the past has a tougher time catching on    That s not to say that products or services can t be innovative   they must be a blend of the old and new  part revolutionary and part reminiscent  It s not just about the technology  but the bridge to a familiar context  The transportations sector offers a clear example   From the start  the Segway had impressive technology and the chance to totally change the way transportation was done forever  The self balancing personal transporter was backed by Steve Jobs  Jeff Bezos and John Doerr  but ended up as one of the biggest flops of its decade   says Berger   A big reason is that consumers didn t know what to do with it  It wasn t a car  not quite a bike or really like a skateboard  They couldn t figure out the situations they d use it for or with whom    Juxtapose that offering with the invention of the car   Now commonplace  automobiles at their inception were as unusual and perplexing as the Segway  People were scared of the car  rural Americans called it the  Devil s Wagon   They saw cars as a symbol of the decadence of the city and introduced laws to restrict them   says Berger   At the turn of the century  one inventor came up with a clever solution  His buggy  called the Horsey Horseless  sported a life size replica of a horse s head on the front of the carriage  It s easy to laugh at and dismiss a fake horse head as silly  but this addition made the car more familiar and less threatening   not only to people  but horses  who were less likely to get spooked    The Horsey Horseless  The Goldilocks Effect  For Berger  the different outcomes of the Segway and Horsey Horseless can be in large part attributed to The Goldilocks Effect   As customers  our emotional reactions are similar to the protagonist from the children s tale  Goldilocks and The Three Bears  Whether it has to do to the softness of the bears  beds or temperature of their porridge  Goldilocks is turned off by the extremes   says Berger   When it comes to new product or service adoption  the outcomes follow the same inverted U shape curve  If something is too novel  it s unfamiliar  weird and harder to understand  But if it s exactly the same as what is happening already  it s boring and there s no reason to change behavior  In between  though  it s just right    Successful  radical innovations often involve cloaking technology in a familiar fa ade   Getting the middle option that s  just right  takes a balance of the old and new and influencing users incrementally when launching products or services  Here are more modern applications of this approach to illustrate the value of building moderately discrepant products   Ease technology transitions via Trojan horse    When introducing the digital video recorder  TiVo could have built any casing for its technology  but it opted for a black  rectangular box that sat below the TV or above a cable box   says Berger   Knowing that customer adoption and changing consumer behavior was critical  the company emulated the look and feel of traditional VCRs  By hiding the technology in familiar fa ade  the transition to a new technology became more palatable    Divert on a dimension  or two    Chobani has become synonymous with Greek yogurt  But not only was it not the first to market  the original  most popular yogurt in Greece had a decade s head start  Yet the incumbent never caught on in the US   says Berger   Why not  The original offering was too unfamiliar to American consumers  Not only did they not know what Greek yogurt meant  but it was mostly offered in large  family sized containers and the only flavor was plain  Issuing a single serving size was a clear first step  but the incremental innovation was putting fruit   such as a berry mix   at the bottom of each container  The Greek yogurt on top stayed the same  but the smaller size and familiar flavors better resembled what Americans knew  Chobani gained market share by being similar to   versus being entirely different from   the competition    Switch up the shell   Many pregnancy tests are essentially the same product  relying on the same technology  but customer s reasons for buying them vary  Some people are hoping to get pregnant  They ve been trying and trying  So the packaging and positioning caters to that  They sell the product in value packs with multiple tests and the image of a happy baby on the front  But other people are the exact opposite  They re hoping not to get pregnant  They want anything but a happy  smiling baby  So for this segment the packaging sells speed of results and promises of reducing worry  Same product  different shell to cater to different audiences   Jonah Berger  How to Actually Use Performance Evaluations to Motivate Employees  Many organizations use titles  levels and compensation bands to denote skill set and seniority  yet they struggle to inspire improvement through performance evaluations   Companies have increasingly moved to peer comparisons to gauge performance  Social comparisons can be a powerful tool   says Berger   Take a completely different context  saving energy  Appealing to cost savings or helping the environment sounds great  but it doesn t change behavior  What does is social comparisons  Clean tech company Opower built its business by comparing people to their neighbors and using that to motivate them to save energy    Opower saw changes in consumers  actions once it started sharing the energy savings that their neighbors enjoyed   What doesn t work is just getting a bill in the mail  There s no context of whether or not you re using a lot of energy  There s no reference point to the losses and gains   says Berger   But when consumers saw how much energy a neighbor with a similarly sized house was using they had a better sense of where they should stand  Combined with specific tactics to save energy  such as replacing electronics or adjusting settings  Opower s programs led to reduce energy consumption by about 2   Over the life of these programs  that s the rough equivalent of taking homes in Alaska and Hawaii off the power grid for an entire year    Social comparisons can generate similar results at the office  but few organizations have designed them effectively   Traditionally  companies have defaulted to a ranking in which one winner is celebrated  such as the top salesperson or engineer of the month  In some ways  this system is solid   it lets people know there s a leader board and sets the benchmark for recognized performance   says Berger   But it also demotivates the rest of the people who know their performance will never measure up  Instead our focus should be on close comparison or what I call proximal peers    Trends in NBA basketball games  halftime scores illustrate this point well   We studied thousands of games and not surprisingly found that teams that were up at halftime are more likely to win the game  The one exception was teams that were behind by just a little  Even though they were worse teams or average  feeling like they were close enough to close the gap motivated them to work harder  They came out of halftime fired up  increased productivity and were more successful as a result    Applied to the workplace  evaluation by close comparison can be an effective way to inspire immediate and improved performance   When compared to a proximal peer   particularly someone who s performing slightly better  people push themselves to work harder  But if compared to the best performer  it s often too far of a reach to stay motivated  When they can barely see the summit  there s less motivation and discipline to scale the mountain   says Berger   Instead of telling someone that they re 27th out of 200 in the company  say to them   You did really well this quarter  but Monica did slightly better in this area  Next quarter or month  see if you can do better than her   Position people in their segment of an overall ranking to benchmark them with people of similar   but slightly better   ability and performance  They ll be more likely to engage and make the effort to meet their new mark    Berger admits that this technique shouldn t be used across every dimension of performance  but used mostly for key areas where you d like to see improvement   There s a danger in telling someone month over month that they re always slightly behind  Of course  sprinkle in earned positive feedback and save this tactic for strategic areas that will benefit the individual and company in the short term   he says   It s true that this can create competition among colleagues  but at least they ll feel it s a competition they can win  It s more effective than comparing everyone to the leader   which still fosters competition   or to historical performance of the individual  which won t often inspire the same drive to outperform    When Berger has worked with smaller startups with fewer people  he s recommended that they benchmark with peers from other similarly sized companies   At that stage  there are so few hands on deck  so inspiring individual performance and team cohesion can be achieved by looking outward   he says   In those cases  be realistic in the short term  You re probably not going to beat Google tomorrow  Pick a few proximal peers that are currently doing better than you but are realistic benchmarks  The longer term  aim for the stars vision should be in place to fuel a sequence of sprints in the short term  that  if sustained  will be realized    How You Can Put Social Influence To Work  In Invisible Influence  Berger cautions readers to not fall prey to believing that they re immune to social influence  Here are three tactics to harness the power of social influence and control it in the workplace   Be a chameleon  When people think of chameleons  they tend to think of one thing  changing color to fit your surrounding environment  It turns out that the same tactic can be useful for people as well   Subtly emulating other people their mannerisms  facial expressions  or language will increase your influence  Negotiators who mirrored the behavior of their negotiating partner  for example  were five times more likely to reach a deal  Waiters or waitresses who echo their customers  orders  repeating back their selection word for word to confirm  get 70  higher tips  Speed daters who mimicked one another more were more likely to go on a second date   says Berger   Mimicry increases liking and trust as well as facilitates social interactions  It turns acquaintances into friends and enemies into partners    Nominate a designated dissenter  Social influence is particularly potent in group settings  so teams must proactively manage it in meetings   There s a fine line between the wisdom of crowds  where groups make better decisions than individuals  and groupthink  where individuals blindly follow a prevailing opinion   says Berger   Someone suggests doing X  and the next person  who might ve been thinking of Y  will tend to go with X as suggested by the first person  especially if that person is senior  Even if they re on the fence or have valuable input to share  they re more likely to go with X  especially in a group context    To avoid the tendency to follow others  opinions by default  nominate a designated dissenter   Everyone eventually tires of the self proclaimed devil s advocate  so the designated dissenter needs to be identified at the start of the meeting and given the proper framing  The person should not be the most senior or junior person  The lead of the meeting should say that the designated dissenter s job is to disagree  regardless of her actual stance   says Berger   This does three things  First  it protects the designated dissenter from disdain as it s her role to play not necessarily her actual style or personality  Second  it gets that person to inject dissenting ideas into discussion  And  third  it frees up everyone else up to share their own independent thoughts  Even if they don t agree with the dissenter  the fact that there is dissent makes it no longer a matter of right and wrong but a matter of opinion  And when it s a matter of opinion  everyone feels more comfortable sharing their own perspective    Cascade into consensus  When you want to sway a group  assess the conviction of the room and use a domino effect to create consensus   Let s say you re in a hiring committee and you prefer candidate A to candidate B  If the group is on the fence  you ll find varying degrees of support around the office  some may be 50  sure of A  others will be 40   a few 30  convinced  and so on   says Berger   To get people to go your way  strategically build consensus before the meeting by picking the order of people with whom you speak  Overtly canvas for the vote of the 50  in support of A people  and once you ve convinced them  the 40  group will be more likely to support you because you have more backers on your side  Groups are more likely to swing your direction once you ve made their similarly convinced neighbor a champion  Once you ve got most support on your side  ask for a vote before the decision is made  Consensus is only valuable if others know you have it     Bringing it All Together  Our own personal thoughts and opinions don t drive our choices as much as we think  Influence often works invisibly  but it can be understood and managed by increment  That may mean bringing a product to market as a blend of the futuristic and familiar or motivating others to perform better by benchmarking with their proximal peers  Individuals can make social influence work in their favor if they learn how there s a dosage of conformity in ingenuity    When you re focused on winning customers  it s easy to forget to make yourself similar to what they know  Change comes from not just flaunting what makes you different  it s also about how you can cloak or blend that difference with familiarity  What we re accustomed to may not be  disruptive  but familiarity is part of the reason we like it   says Berger   Social influence isn t good or bad  But by understanding how it works can we decide when to resist it and when to embrace it,"[736 246 1316 1045 154 561 863 721 982 284 51]"
739,training-dataset/product/952.txt,product,The Manifesto of Ruthless Prioritization   NewCo ShiftTick  Tock  That s the clock counting down to the moment when your startup runs out of money  Whether your goal is profitability or hitting some proof point in order to raise the next round of fundraising  make no doubt about it  each moment is precious  Every feature you build  every a b test you start  every customer acquisition strategy you implement  and every single question you ask your users is important  You are making a choice at the expense of something else you could be doing  It s a zero sum game   Big companies may be able to burn their gold on frivolous initiatives in order to feed the hungry beast  Late stage companies may be able to use their war chest to expand into adjacent categories  A startup can do neither  A startup can only focus on the top two or three priorities or  preferably  focus only on the number one priority  This is really hard  Doing this in practice maximizes your chance of success  but screw this up and you re dead   The ability to know what to do and the discipline to focus only on that is ruthless prioritization  Here are three ways to ensure your company is on the right track   Solve only the important  hard problems   Most of us in the world of technology or startups are problem solvers  We love rolling up our sleeves and solving a good puzzle  Whether it s solving the New York Times crossword  kicking ass in Civilization VI  or figuring out how to crack the  400B home services market  we like a meaty challenge   The problem is that just as much as we like to solve a puzzle  we also love getting things done and crossing them off our list  In a startup context  there s a danger here  The danger is in being seduced by smaller  more solvable problems instead of going after the big motherscratcher  Knocking out a bunch of second order problems feels good in the short run until you realize you ve built little value and have no competitive moat  Don t do that  Many failed startups have solved some interesting easy ish problems  but every successful startup has solved at least one really  really hard problem  The Googles  Apples and Facebooks of the world have solved a few of these mega problems   Ruthless prioritization means having the discipline to solve the big  really hard problem rather than being seduced by all the small  easier problems   Often it s difficult to know whether you are solving an important problem or a trivial one  It s useful to try to think beyond tactics  processes and features  Think about what brain splitting pain the customer is experiencing and how you can make that go away  It s been said a million times  make pain killers not vitamins  The Jobs to be Done Theory can help in understanding what the real job is that your customer is hiring your product to do  This is exemplified by something economist Theodore Levitt once said   people do not want a quarter inch drill  they want a quarter inch hole    Don t fall in love with the product  fall in love with the mission   It is easy to get attached to the wrong things and that attachment can lead your prioritization astray  That cool beta app that you ve soft launched  that slick signup flow you ve built  the homegrown javascript framework you coded  that beautiful homepage carousel you designed it s easy to fall for the shiny artifacts you have created  Beware  Your love affair with these things may lead you to protect them even when they are no longer useful or not the best option  Maybe that cool app is actually cool  but does it really drive the business  Maybe the world  and your business  doesn t really need another homegrown javascript framework to maintain forever  This goes for your team as well  Perhaps you no longer need three widget makers  Two would be sufficient and you could use invest the difference somewhere else   Any startup worth its Kind Bars has an inspiring mission to build something meaningful and make a positive impact on the world  This is where you should focus your passion  Fall in love with the mission  Obsess over every priority  every decision  every current situation as to whether it gets you closer to your mission or not  If it doesn t  you know what to do  Cut it   change it   do something else   Ruthless prioritization means falling in love with the mission  not the product   Culture is necessary for ruthless prioritization   When you are saying  no  to thousands of good ideas  when you are saying  no  to your CEO  when you are saying  no  to your colleagues and customers  this creates a lot of tension  Serious tension  This is why culture is critical to the practice of ruthless prioritization   Most companies get the first half of culture right  Through happy hours  holiday parties  team building off sites  and trust falls  team members get to know each other and start to care for each other as human beings  When you care for each other  it s likely you ll want to do good by your team  fulfill your commitments  and make others like you  Strong personal relationships also lead to empathy and a willingness to help each other out  These are crucial attributes of a startup culture  any culture for that matter   But  while caring for each other is important  it is not enough   Most companies don t realize that it s critical to create a culture where honest  challenging feedback is normal and expected  A culture where everyone cares about each other but doesn t give feedback creates  as Kim Scott  Founder of Radical Candor  would say   ruinous empathy   Luckily  this is a pretty easy problem to fix once you are aware of it   At TaskRabbit  we send every new employee to a two day training where they learn about giving feedback  having those hard  tension filled conversations  and how to navigate common pitfalls that teams often succumb to  It s a big investment for us but everyone confidently leaves those two days with common tools and language for giving each other feedback  We refresh those learnings several times a year with the whole team  Now  when someone simply says  feedback  the word itself often pops people out of their normal mindsets and opens them up to input  The investment pays off   We are not perfect at TaskRabbit  but if there s one thing we are great at  it s the balance between caring for each other and the ability to challenge each other directly  Ruthless prioritization depends on these two facets of culture existing in harmony   A culture balanced between direct feedback and camaraderie is key in ruthless prioritization   Look   I need to wrap this up and get back to my top priority  I told you this was going to be hard  but  see  I am working on a really difficult  important problem  The world is going to be a better place when I solve this  I know you ll understand  I know you appreciate directness  Adios   Like this  Please click the heart icon  share on

747,training-dataset/business/303.txt,business,Ways We WorkAs a CTO in a growing tech business  in a growing company  what kind of pressures do you face that people wouldn t really expect or understand   One thing I would say that is the most terrifying is being confronted with how much I don t know on a daily basis  on an hourly basis  Having the hunger and the drive that I think you need when you want to build something yourself  it means that you re always trying to know everything  That contrast of wanting to know everything with realizing how little you know  and how little time you have to be able to learn all of the things you want to know that s a hard pill for me to swallow   The other thing is trust  and how important of a role that plays  If you re a builder  your first instinct is   I ll fix it   But  I have to trust that the people that work with me are more than capable  and let them do it and grow with it as well  That takes time to understand and to accept  Everything else is relatively easy  There s a lot of challenges with data  with revenue  all of the things that are challenging for anyone building a company  but if you think you have the right product then all of those pieces will fall into place  The real challenge is trusting that you will be able to find the right people and help make it easier for those pieces to fall into the right place   What are some of the tools you use to keep organized and keep on top of all the things you have to do on a daily basis   Evernote   Gmail   I m always taking random notes but they eventually end up in Evernote which is where I manage my day to day and my long term work  Then I have my setup with Gmail and Google Calendar and that s pretty much it   We have a whole bunch of tools that we use at work of course  We use Slack and Jira and Confluence and all that stuff  But  for me personally  it s really those two   Speaking to your own work life balance  what are some things you do to reboot or step away from your work to re energize   Not nearly enough  Taking photos is a big part of it  It s a very active thing  I always have my camera around but actually making an effort to go and take photos of something  having a project in mind  I do a lot of those throughout the year  I do a lot of analog photography which is even better because it s more about getting back to the basics of printing it out  holding your breath and pulling the trigger between two heartbeats to get that moment  Then there s the pleasure of developing a film and seeing it weeks later  that s definitely one of those things   Yoga and climbing are also helpful  They re probably the only two forms of exercise where I can completely disconnect and recharge  I don t necessarily need to get away for a long time to recharge  To me  it s more of a cyclical thing  If I manage to exercise often enough and manage to see enough people I care about  and read enough non work material and take photos those are the things that I like to do and if I manage to do a couple of those things plus work then I m very happy,"[747 1316 154 609 1145 456 313 667 561 51 670]"
749,training-dataset/product/931.txt,product,The magic of microcopy   uxdesign cc Photo by Nina Strehl   The magic of microcopy  Delight is in the details  When I think about the products I love  they all have one thing in common  delightful little details   There s this coffee shop I visit almost every day  Whenever I order a drink  they always add a little artwork on top  It might be a fancy leaf one day  a swirly swan the next  These foamy figures don t make the drink taste any better  but they do make me smile   This delightful detail shows that they put a lot of love into what they re making  It s just a little detail  a little shape  but it shapes how I feel about the product   In design  one detail that often gets overlooked is microcopy   the little bits of text that guide us through an experience  In apps and websites  microcopy includes things like button labels  hint text  and error messages   When used in the right places  microcopy can turn a mundane task into something memorable  In this story  we ll see how microcopy can be used in all sorts of delightful ways   By the end  I hope you ll see just how magical microcopy can be   1  Show that you re human  At my local grocery store  they have self checkout lanes where I can scan my items and be on my way  Call me old fashioned  but I prefer going to the real cashiers  Those lanes take longer  but I actually like chatting with real people   Words on a screen can never take the place of a real conversation  but good microcopy can show that real people created your product  If your product sounds human  it s easier for people to trust you  Open up to your users  and they can open up to you   Below are a few examples of products that sound human and conversational  like a friend who s chatting with you   Product Hunt s tone is warm and welcoming  Notice the self awareness   humble piece of internet    casual expressions   geek out    and smiley face   Vimeo shows they have real humans in charge  Notice how they say  we   Computers don t say  we   but people do   Yelp uses a super casual tone  It encourages people to open up and leave an honest review   2  Sprinkle in some surprise  One way to create a feeling of delight is to use the element of surprise  Aristotle once said   The secret to humor is surprise   This idea also applies to microcopy    The secret to delightful microcopy is surprise      Some dude on Medium  Sometimes  all you need is a well placed message to put a smile on someone s face  Think of safe places in your product where you can surprise people with a little delight   A loading screen  A success message  An error message  An example or placeholder  An onboarding flow  An empty state  Let s look at a few examples of microcopy being used in unexpected ways to create a feeling of delight   Zeplin brews up some coffee as you wait for your page to load    Tumblr sneaks in some fun messages  while still being helpful   After you create a few docs  Dropbox Paper shows different placeholder messages to get you in the writing mood   3  Boost their confidence  When we use most apps and websites  we often have a goal in mind  Maybe we re trying to look up some info  order something online  or create something   To get to that goal  there s usually a series of steps we need to take  If those steps get tedious  some of us might give up and curse the internet gods      That s when microcopy can help  In a multi step flow  microcopy can encourage people to keep going  People are lazy  Sometimes  we all need a little motivation to get things done   Below are a few examples of products giving people a friendly nudge to encourage them to do something   Some people like to stay anonymous online  so Dribbble encourages you to enter your real name in a friendly way   Some people might feel spooked by sharing their birth date  so Airbnb uses delight to reassure you   Nordstrom compliments you after you add items to your cart  They re reassuring you that you made the right choice   4  Get a little personal  The other day  I got a thank you card for attending a friend s wedding  It started out like any other thank you card   Thanks for joining us  yadda yadda yadda   But then my friend slipped in a reference to something we did in high school  It brought back some good memories   The thing that made the card special was that it was specific to me  Because of that specific memory from high school  I knew nobody else got the same exact message  It was personalized for me   Sometimes you can replicate this good feeling through your microcopy  By customizing the message for a specific person or group of people  you can make them feel special   Let s see how some products create delight by customizing their messages for different people   OkCupid compliments your city when creating a new account   Ahh  London    Meetup lets organizers customize the name for participants  like  Bookworms   That s a lot better than  attendees    Asana greets you differently depending on the time of day  After 10pm  you ll get  Hello  night owl    5  Sweat the details  If you look at any web or mobile product  you d be surprised how much microcopy there is  Take Dropbox for example  Seems like a simple product without a lot of words  How many messages do you think there are in the Dropbox interface   Believe it or not  Dropbox has over 27 000 messages in its interface  27 000  By comparison  the first Harry Potter book has a little over 6 600 sentences  Do you know how many messages you have in your product  Probably a lot more than you d expect   So where the heck are all these messages  Well  they show up everywhere  from the top of your browser to the ALT tags in each image  Each message has an opportunity to delight  and a good writer will sweat the details for each and every message   Take a look at how these products use delightful microcopy in the most obscure places   When you log out  MailChimp says  See Ya Later  at the top of the browser   Basecamp s footer has a friendly message that changes depending on the day of week   The Design Content conference site has delightful ALT tags  like  Eileen Webb smiling at you and wearing a warm scarf    6  Pair it with a picture  Dr  Seuss is famous for delighting people by pairing words with pictures  His drawings are dreamy  His words are whimsical  But it s when you pair them together that they truly become magical   Here s one of my favorite quotes from him    Words and pictures are yin and yang  Married  they produce a progeny more interesting than either parent      Dr  Seuss  Theodor Seuss Geisel   Whether it s a photo  illustration  or emoji  a simple picture can sometimes be the perfect pairing for your microcopy  They work together to create a feeling of delight that s more magical than words or pictures alone   Let s see some of this pairing in action   Flickr pairs sad news with a lighthearted photo to keep your spirits up   Hubspot s error page pairs loving words with an image of a broken heart   Slack pairs clever copy with a rocket ship emoji  The emoji makes the copy more memorable   But hold up   All this talk of delightful microcopy might sound fine and dandy  but honestly  it s a hard thing to get right  You need to keep in mind the dangers of delightful design  because too much whimsy can get in the way   In interface writing  it s usually best to strive for brevity and clarity  But fun microcopy often requires longer messages and less clarity  Depending on your brand  you need to figure out where you stand on this spectrum  When do you optimize for clarity and when do you optimize for delight   Before you start adding fun microcopy all over your product  here are a few things I d recommend   Find your voice  Put together guidelines for how your product should sound  Many companies have a writing style guide that defines their voice and tone  Need help getting started  Check out some examples on styleguides io   Put together guidelines for how your product should sound  Many companies have a writing style guide that defines their voice and tone  Need help

big part in shaping how people think about your product  so don t miss out on the opportunity to delight people with words   It s not just about getting people from point A to point B  Sometimes  you gotta let  em enjoy the ride  too      Before I wrap up  I d love to give a huge shout out to Ania Banaszek  a designer at SoundCloud  This story wouldn t have been possible without her amazing help

startups were never meant to be businesses at all  You probably know Tina best as Swiss Miss  the name of her wildly popular design blog  which began as a personal online archive well before averaging over a million unique monthly visitors  It s one of a few side projects or  labors of love   as Tina calls them  that grew into full time gigs  Those include TeuxDeux  a very simple to do app  the breakfast lecture series Creative Mornings  which now has more than 160 chapters around the world  FRIENDS  a co working space in Brooklyn  and Tattly  a designer driven temporary tattoo company  Tina joined me on the podcast to share her tips for juggling multiple projects  where she found the greatest learning curve as a designer turned startup founder  the role community can play in inspiring great work  and much more  If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the interview  but if you re short on time  here are a few key takeaways  The common link between Tina s many successful projects   solutions to a personal pain point  If you re going to complain about  then try fixing it  Tina s biggest lesson learned in the past year  Any founder  regardless of background or industry  must get a handle on and appreciation for sales in order to succeed  Silos put a ceiling on any startup  Surround yourself with a diverse group of people that have high standards in their work and complement your own skills  If you re a founder that cannot dedicate 100  of your time to one company  you have to hire people that are very self driven and take initiative when you re tending to competing responsibilities  Stewart Scott Curran  Tina  welcome to the show  Incidentally  you re the only person I know who has an emergency drawer of confetti  Tina Roth Eisenberg  I m a big believer in having a confetti drawer  yes  Every business should have one  It always puts a smile on people s faces when you open the drawer and it s just jam packed with confetti  Stewart  You re juggling a lot of projects and have been doing so for a while  How did these  labors of love   as you call them  become full  and perhaps unintentional  businesses  Tina  I grew up in Switzerland and trained as a graphic designer  When I was 26 I graduated and moved to New York for what was supposed to be a three month internship  I fell completely in love with the city  I worked for quite a few years as a designer at various design studios and specialized in interactive and user interface design  When my daughter was born I had this moment of   I really should follow my dreams   and I always wanted a design studio  I started my own design studio and I had very cool clients right away  and then very quickly realized that I didn t want to work from home  Quickly after I started my design studio  I started a co working space before co working spaces were a thing  It has completely changed my life and has been the best decision I ve ever made  because if you surround yourself with really smart and creative people  you raise the bar  Out of that co working space  while I ran my own design studio  I started these  labors of love   little side projects  They have organically turned into businesses  For example  I started a to do app with my studio mate Cameron Koczon over a lunch conversation  I basically lamented the state of to do apps and how they have too many bells and whistles  I just wanted something simple  I designed it  and two days later  he built it  and then we had TeuxDeux  a very simple to do app  which has actually turned into a small side business  Then I started a temporary tattoo business called Tattly  which was really began as just a joke  Now we have 17 people working on the team and we ship tattoos all around the world  which we license from artists and designers   TeuxDeux was born out of a shared disdain for overdone to do apps  Creative Mornings  which is a breakfast lecture series  began by simply opening the doors to my design studio and letting the larger creative community come in  That has organically grown over the past eight years to include 160 cities around the world  I have this knack of seeing a need for something  or something that I want to fix  and I do it out of sheer love for the process  because I want it to exist in the world  Then the world screams at me and basically says  this should be a business and needs to grow  I need to stop starting things  It s like with shoes  If a new pair of shoes comes in  one needs to go  and I have a lot of ideas for starting new things  but I m not allowed to because something else would have to get off my plate first  Stewart  There s a common link between all of those endeavors  you ve spotted a problem and then created something you think solves it  I remember you saying that if you complain about something more than two times then you feel a responsibility to do something about it   This quote from musician James Murphy has long been a source of inspiration for Tina s ideas  Tina  That s my personal rule  It drives me crazy because complaining is a real waste of energy  If I catch myself complaining repeatedly about something  I have two options  do something about it or let it go  For example  Tattly  the temporary tattoo company I started  was literally because I would complain about the state of temporary tattoos and how hideous the designs were that my daughter would bring home from birthday parties  At one point  I thought   Tina  you need to make a decision  either stop complaining or make it better   So I did  The sales learning curve Stewart  Tattly is a business that s focused on sales  whereas Creative Mornings is something fairly different   it s a more altruistic  localized system that s self sustainable and not focused on profit  Where s the tension between those  How does running those two things differ and what lessons have you learned through doing both of those at the same time  Tina  This is the thing I had been thinking about in 2016  First of all  I never set out to run two companies at the same time  I m often like   What in the world was I thinking   At Creative Mornings  the only measurements we have to me are how much do we grow around the world  how many people attend  and how much goodness and happiness does it bring  It s a volunteer driven organization  and we have over 1 500 volunteers around the world  Then there s Tattly  which at the end of the day a sales driven company  and I am not a salesperson at heart  There is a lot of tension in that because I had to learn and embrace sales as an art form last year  I m someone who loves to build the machine and figure out how the machine works  but I really didn t care about the sales dial was set on it  if it s on six or 12   and I had to start caring  When you re a sales driven company  at the end of the day  even if you sell artistic things  you need to care about your margins and the sales channels  Everyone can start learning to become a more sales driven person  I sometimes laugh because now here I am  sitting  looking at Excel spreadsheets and talking and worrying about margins  How have I become that person  There s been a lot of personal growth  but I do also realize that when you run two companies that are so different  like a sales company versus Creative Mornings  the people you attract are so different  The people that end up running these companies are very different people  and I can experience this firsthand because I run them simultaneously  and these people are all in the same room  It s incredibly fascinating  I would ve never guessed  even though I m the same person running both and I have the same set of values  that it ends up being a completely different organism with different kind of people in it  One day I might have to write a book about it  Short answer is that in my hearts of hearts  I m not a salesperson  but everyone can embrace it and start learning to become a more sales driven person  That was my lesson of 2016  Anyone out there who thinks   I can t sell   or  this is not my thing   everyone can learn it  I can give some lessons now  Stewart  At the same time  you still bring a huge sense of fun to that work  I ve seen you doing the trade show stuff  but then you also had your little pop up shop in Brooklyn  Tina  I had to bring in my own version of selling  so that it s not crushing my soul  I do it with a whole lot of humor and I embrace the silly in the whole thing  That s another thing I had to learn  If running companies has taught me one thing  there is not one way of doing something   Tattly s pop up tattoo shop in Brooklyn As someone who started a retail e commerce business with Tattly  not knowing anything about any of it  there s such beauty in being a complete novice in a certain industry because you come in and you basically question things that other people would never even question  I knew nothing about trade shows  I knew nothing about wholesale accounts  I just knew nothing  I never thought about margins up until a year and a half ago when I hired a real salesperson and she s says   let s look at your margins   It s incredibly refreshing when you start a business with such innocence and enthusiasm like I did and then automatically bring a breath of fresh air to an industry that others would never even dare to do  The power of community Stewart  Community is a very important part of your life philosophy and career  whether it s stuff like Creative Mornings or a co working space like Friends Work Here  What can fellow creators and entrepreneurs learn from folks in industries and disciplines outside their own  Tina  If I look at my career and my life  I just  I always had this desire to get people together  When I was in high school  I ran the student council and organized events  so that was in my DNA  Now  in a more professional setting  I wasn t kidding when I said that I started my first iteration of my co working space nine years ago  Studiomates  the moment I realized that  you benefit  when you surround yourself with people that are equally driven  creative  but from different industries  I sat next to a developer and behind me was an illustrator and a writer  We all had our different crafts that we were really good at  Because up until then  I felt like we were always in our silos  I would only go to graphic designer events  and the information architects would only hang out together  but when you sit together and you can turn around and I can ask a photographer for advice or the guy who s just running a startup next to me  there s such incredible value and magic that happens  I always tell everyone that is starting out to find that group of people that has really high standards in their work and that complement you in some way  I have become so much better at everything I do and have set my bar so much higher and my goals have changed because of the people that I surrounded myself with  That translates not only to co working spaces but also now with Creative Mornings  The first time I met most of the hosts at our first organizer summit my heart nearly exploded  because I realized these people are making me better  These people have incredible values and the goodness they put into the world made me raise my bar yet again for who I am and what I want to achieve in my life  I know that sounds a little cheesy  but I have two kids  If I want to teach them something it s that they have to be really  really thoughtful with who they surround themselves with at any time in their life  Stewart  Creative Mornings has become somewhat of a phenomenon  It s a true global community now with chapters in 160 cities worldwide  How do you approach growing and spreading something that s just as much of an idea as it is a business  Confidence is impressive and enthusiasm is contagious  Tina  The only answer I can come up with is that my secret superpower is enthusiasm  When I m excited about something  I will just light up a room with my giddiness and excitement around it in a way that is very contagious  Other people then say  well  you could do the same thing with being confident about something  but I don t believe that because I feel like confidence is impressive and enthusiasm is contagious  It s the latter that spreads  With Creative Mornings  I rented for two years in New York City never thinking about growing it  but by me talking about it on my blog and sharing the talks  people wanted that in their life and started asking me about running it  Stewart  I did it in San Francisco for two years and it was an incredible experience  It was interesting how that enthusiasm translated across different countries  different territories  different cultures   everybody was getting excited about the same things  That s not something I had really experienced before  Global excitement and global community  everybody feels like a part of this movement of generosity  We need more of that type of thing  Tina  More than ever  the world needs really safe places for people to get together and find their like minded community,"[753 561 609 51 154 1145 782 1316 1390 775 799]"

770,training-dataset/business/541.txt,business,FI co  Hiring T Shaped Professionals For Your StartupIn this guest blog post  Shawn Parrotte  Marketing Manager at Designli and friend of the Founder Institute  explains the difference between T shaped and I shaped professionals  and what to consider when hiring them at your startup   As more college graduates enter the job market  they re creating an ever widening skills gap that businesses are finding difficult to overcome  It s because of this gap that there s a need for employees with skill sets that incorporate a broad knowledge base  in addition to having a deep understanding in a specified area  rather than being experienced in only one discipline  These individuals are known to have a T Shaped skill set  and there are many reasons to consider adding them to your staff   What s the Difference Between T Shaped and I Shaped Professionals   Over the past few years  the concept of the T Shaped skill set has risen to the forefront of the professional community  This  in part  has been brought on by the ever increasing need for businesses to be multidimensional  However  before we define the characteristics that make a T Shaped professional so valuable in the workplace  it is important to discuss the traits of an I Shaped professional  so that there are sufficient means for comparison   I Shaped Professionals  The primary identifier of an I Shaped professional is that of someone with an in depth level of knowledge in one specific discipline  In fact  today  most young adults that are entering the workforce straight from college can be regarded as I Shaped   The reason these individuals are defined as such stems largely from the curriculum structure in places of higher education  Universities tend to base their degree programs around specific disciplines and this reduces the exposure that students have to alternative subjects  While this can help a student to become thoroughly educated in one area  it also keeps them from broadening their exposure to many of the concepts that can be vital for success   T Shaped Professionals  Unlike that of an I Shaped  a T Shaped professional is someone that is regarded as having an expansive skill set in addition to a level of expertise in a specific subject  This broad spectrum of general knowledge is signified by the horizontal bar  of which  completes the T Shaped model   The expansive arsenal of skills from which T Shaped professionals are able to draw from gives them added versatility in the workplace  Furthermore  these individuals are continually searching for additional ways to broaden the scope of the horizontal bar on top of the  T   And while many T Shaped individuals do  in fact  possess a college degree  it is their experience in additional facets that make them so valuable as employees   It is worth noting that both types of individuals are critical to the success of a company  however  a T Shaped professional can bring more to the table in terms of overall experience  It is for this reason that many businesses are now focusing on adding individuals with T Shaped skill sets to their staff   Why Are T Shaped Professionals Valuable to Startups   As the concept of the T Shaped professional becomes more prevalent in the business community  the necessity to hire these individuals increases significantly  In particular  it s becoming more common for startups to take extra steps in seeking out these individuals and there is an array of reasons for this trend   Teamworking Skills  When a person is exposed to a wide range of disciplines this can help to instill within them the importance of teamwork  which can be greatly beneficial to startups  In trying to get a business off the ground  many companies struggle because of the individualistic tendencies of its employees  and this is often a consequence of a rigid educational background   And  while universities do promote the concept of teamwork to some extent  the studying of a single discipline can lead to a lack of exposure to the ideologies that others possess  On the other hand  professionals with a T Shaped skill set are often well accustomed to working as part of a team so that they can gain knowledge in areas beyond the scope of their expertise   More Communicative  Communication is vital for an employee to be successful  and those with broader knowledge bases are typically more adept at communicating  The reason for these superior communication skills comes from the idea that T Shaped professionals are often required to communicate with people of varying backgrounds in order to expand their knowledge base   In addition to communicating with those of different backgrounds  the process of gaining knowledge to become a more well rounded individual often involves interacting with people from other areas of the world  and this takes a certain level of skill in itself  When a person is able to communicate effectively  without being hindered by language barriers  it is a strong indicator that the person will not let obstacles stand in the way of their attempts at knowledge growth   Innovative Mindset  If there is one skill that summarizes a T Shaped professional  it s the ability to bring innovative ideas to a business  While college may prepare a student to be an expert in a single discipline  this can cause them to follow the rigid structure of curriculum too closely  and in turn  this can prevent them from coming up with innovative ideas on their own   On the other hand  those who have been exposed to a range of disciplines will embrace and generate more ideas naturally  When an employee brings an innovative mindset to a startup  they can help to foster new initiatives that may have been previously neglected  After all  innovation stems from one s ability to think outside of the box  and focusing on a single topic may keep the creative well a little dry   When Wouldn t You Want to Hire T Shaped Professionals   It may come as a surprise  but there are times when I Shaped skill sets are more valuable than T Shaped ones  This is primarily a concern when a startup has experienced success and the growth has brought about the need for employees with deep knowledge in a specific area of the startup  In this case  the broad knowledge base of the T Shaped professional will not be utilized   How to Find and Hire Them   With the increase in demand for T Shaped professionals comes with it the challenges in finding individuals that this characteristic type  One of the most effective ways to find them is through a referral system  While a resume and work history can go a long way in showing whether the candidate has a well rounded repertoire  it does not guarantee success  If you are looking for a T Shaped professional for your startup consider asking acquaintances and other working professional if they know of anyone who might meet the needs of the position   The interview process also plays a critical role in ensuring that the needs of the startup are met  When interviewing candidates  it is imperative to ask the right questions in order to hone in on applicant s skill set  And while it is necessary to inquire about the educational background of the candidate during the interview  try to single out the T Shaped professionals by asking applicants to provide examples of projects that they were previously involved in and the role they played in bringing the project to maturation   In addition  as a startup  you will want an employee that has an entrepreneurial spirit  as this could help in promoting the growth of the company  When interviewing candidates  look for traits that show the person has the ability to think outside the box  This mindset could help the company to develop original ideas that may not have been previously considered  In fact  companies like IBM and Cisco are currently developing technologies that will help to better match employers with candidates that show personality traits commonly associated with entrepreneurs   In Conclusion  As it has been shown  hiring T Shaped professionals can be vital toward achieving the success that startups require  These people bring with them an expansive educational background that encompasses a range of different disciplines  In addition  they often possess superior team working skills and communicative abilities  And while there is a necessity for both types of people in the workplace  by ensuring that you have T Shaped professionals on staff  you will help to expand the possibilities of your business        Help Wanted Sign  A red sign with text Help Wanted on a keyboard image by Shutterstock,"[770 386 1396 362 940 1349 51 799 863 1368 585]"
775,training-dataset/business/833.txt,business,Sales Hacker s Top 10 Trends   Predictions Heading Into 2017In 2011 I was tasked with scaling a sales team at a small company called Udemy  Having no real sales floor experience  I took a completely different approach  I built a highly technical process  sometime over complicating things  that would help our resource constrained marketplace scale like Amazon   A few months in we created the first Sales Hacker meetup  where we d share hacks on all things sales  From using the programing language Python to scrape data from the web  to leveraging new sales email automation tools like ToutApp  and building virtual SDR teams through TaskUs and Upwork to set up demos with less overhead   Fast forward 5 years and our little tech bubble is producing sales and marketing technologies at breakneck speeds  This is both promising and worrisome for buyers and sellers  On the one hand  any advantage you can get you should be grateful for  On the other hand  there s a lot of bad training and poor judgement being accelerated   That said  2017 is going to be another great year for sales  The technologies are more developed  The reps and managers are wiser  And the industry as a whole has gotten attention that has brought talent in like never before   So what s next  Let s dive in on this years top 10 trends and predictions as we head into 2017   The Big Ones  Microsoft buying LinkedIn was huge  Like MASSIVE  Salesforce and competitors are not happy  I ve read articles from people saying that LinkedIn has stalled  or usage is declining  or ad revenue is weak  etc  but the crowdsourced database they have can be the heartbeat of any sales org   If I asked 1000 people about their tech stack  90  plus would probably say they use a CRM and maybe Salesforce would have the majority share of those users  But if I asked them what else was in their stack  90  plus would also say they use LinkedIn  and there s no competitors there  They are the Band Aid or Kleenex brand of professional social networks   In last years predictions we had LinkedIn going into the CRM space  Well a big player in the CRM space bought LinkedIn because LinkedIn has the data  A ton of hot companies are trying to build predictive solutions  and databases that provide insights into buying patterns  and act as data vendors  and it s a humongous business  But nobody has a stranglehold on the most up to date data like LinkedIn does   The kicker is  I m curious to see how they capitalize on it  They won t pull back from Salesforce  at least not right away  If Microsoft wants to take on Salesforce they ll need to buy a lot more companies in the space  and get really serious about marketing but that s next    I think you ll see these companies and more  aggressively spend in 2017  There are two other interesting things to keep an eye on   Google is putting more effort into the G Suite  They hired the ex VMware founder and CEO to take over  and put some real heavy hitting VPs around her  I wouldn t be surprised if they buy a CRM on top of Gmail like Streak or ProsperWorks   It makes a ton of sense too  There s a lot of money to be made in selling to the sales org these days  and more and more companies are moving from Outlook to Gmail  It s too logical   Salesforce is still a major acquisition target for someone  How about Amazon  Salesforce just switched all of their cloud infrastructure to Amazon data centers  They have the cash  Microsoft is likely out now  so it really leaves them and Oracle  which I thought would happen in 2016  because Benioff would ve been the best Larry Ellison successor  I really like Salesforce as a standalone company though  I think they have a lot of potential to continue their ascent in SaaS and the public markets   Separate from LinkedIn Microsoft aggressively spending  they ll need to start figuring out how to compete with Salesforce s marketing engine  This is where Salesforce sets themselves apart  They re a marketing company  300 000 people come to town for Dreamforce every year  Then  they also have a roadshow  They clearly understand the importance of unbiased sales thought leadership  hence the partnership with Sales Hacker  If you teach someone to fish  they ll go to you when they re ready to buy a fishing pole  bait  and tackle   I wonder how LinkedIn Microsoft will enter the ring here  They have a massive opportunity to be the go to place for all things sales  yet haven t capitalized on it to date  Just see how Medium curates it s content into niche periodicals  It s against my best interest to go into to much detail here  but if done right  every sales professional should be glued to LinkedIn like every teenager to Snapchat  The metric that matters here is Daily Active Users  And the higher that gets  the more possibilities they have for producing revenue  training  ads  premium features  etc    LinkedIn still sees themselves as a social selling company  Either they don t understand the bigger data picture  or they re worried about being a Social Network and a B2B database  Which is justified  But until that s clear  it will be tough for them to compete for eyeballs and dollars  even with Microsoft behind them  It s time to double down on being a premier player in the sales space  and to do that  they need to nail The Show  AKA marketing    The Little Ones  That leads me to the next logical event to play out in the near future  Roll ups  There has been so much Seed and Angel money floating around  that anyone can build an app for sales and enter the marketplace  I see a lot of companies in the  500k to  2m ARR range that have somewhat stalled  The Series A money is much harder to get with slow growth and only startup logos   So the bigger companies and even medium size private companies will jump into the action of rolling up these stalled out Series A ready companies  And some will even merge into one single company instead of two unnecessary competitors  We re already seeing that outside of sales with the VTS Hightower merger  I think this will ramp up in 2017  There are too many similar point plays and not enough differentiated platforms  I think we ll see PE funds started just for these scenarios  and not just in sales and marketing  Sales and marketing  just happens to be very ready for it   Crowdsourcing  Data  Reviews    Networks  Jigsaw once sold to Salesforce for  300m and was renamed Data com  They created a way for people to update other people s contact info  and in exchange  you received contact info for people you didn t know  that someone else had updated  This is crowdsourced data  and now they re doing it again with Owler   Here s another reason why LinkedIn is key  They have the most up to date data because it s done by the user  If only they used to collect things like  what s in your tech stack  or  when did you buy X product    what do you think of it   or  how much did you pay    This is where the market is going  Companies like G2Crowd and TrustRadius are giving you crowdsourced reviews for tech products  similar to Yelp or Amazon reviews  They go pretty far to make sure you actually bought and it s a real review  At some point  when these platforms hit critical mass  and I m not saying it s in 2017 but when they do  this is going to change the way we buy and sell SaaS  For now  I know quite a few people who are using it not to discover products  but to evaluate products further down the sales process   Emissary io is another interesting model that allows you to find people who worked in certain silos of an organization you re trying to sell to  and will tell you how to sell to the individuals that make the decisions  For example  you re working on a deal with the Marketing department at a Fortune 500 company  They ll connect you to the ex VP of that product value who will tell you who to talk to and how to sell to them  This is the newest gadget in your Account Based Sales Marketing strategy   Speaking of Account Based strategies   Setting Yourself Apart  When I wrote Hacking Sales  I wrote it from the perspective of selling at a startup or through a go to market strategy with limited resources  We had to build sales at scale  Now it s safe to say we ve coupled sales automation and bad no training and created a monster  Sales Automation or Acceleration or whatever you want to call it is here to support  not take over  I love that we can use technology to our advantage  We just need to make sure we train people well enough to use it   Let s start with outbound emailing  If you re blasting emails to lists without segmenting  without personalizing  and without caring  then you ll get the same crappy results as everyone else until you move on to the next job and fizzle out of sales in 5 years  If you send 100 emails in the same time it takes to send 1 email  but with both have a 1 person conversion  it s not a draw  The person who sent 100 emails loses  They may have burned bridges  or their email server  or worse   But this section isn t about bad practices as much as it is about setting yourself apart  Or as a good friend once said  Angles of Asymmetric Warfare  AKA If everyone is sending emails  doing phone calls  and walking through a 21 step  7 day cadence  what are you doing to set yourself apart  I know people who are doing interesting things in direct mail again  Using real  in depth research is another way to do it  But this is crucial  and will become a focus for reps and orgs again  as companies look to grow ACV  Average Contract Value  and do bigger deals  How are you setting yourselves apart from the rest of the solicitors   This is why I m excited about the next level of Account Based Sales   Marketing  There s a certain type of creativity that becomes an orgs most valuable asset when it comes to breaking into an account  What channels do you go through  what sets you apart  what level of research do you do  and what research really matters   The Truth About Technology  I m not talking about emailing here  We ve harped on email as an industry  so I won t keep doing it  You can read more in our How Not To Send Crappy Emails eBook   What I am talking about is all of these new buzz words  In 2016  the buzzword to add to some area of your homepage was  Account Based _____   In 2017  it s a variation of Sales Bots  Sales AI  or Machine Learning  Some of it is complete BS  Like adding the words AI or Machine Learning to something all of a sudden turns your product into Jarvis from Ironman  Or just because your domain ends in  ai doesn t really mean that it s using any real advanced AI   Most companies are doing either one  or both of these things   Doing a lot of it manually using outsourcers  and trying to figure out AI as they go   Throwing a ton of developer resources behind building actual AI  selling it as AI  but it s only halfway there   But this is all irrelevant ramblings  because the truth is  it s VC subsidized sales help  and you should take advantage of it and stop being stubborn about change  Things are changing  It s good   Here s my point  X ai helps you better schedule meetings  Troops ai helps you better log things in Salesforce and stay on top of your tasks  I know a few companies in stealth doing some amazing things to help your reps make sure they re following up  Gong and ExecVision help your reps make better calls  Take advantage of these tools and hope that they can figure it out before the money runs out  Because if they do  your team will save a ton of time  and be endlessly more efficient  and it ll be cheap compared to the alternative   Again  these are here to support reps and managers  not replace  Don t get those two things confused  and you ll be just fine   Sales   Marketing Have Morphed  The Account Based Everything hype is just the beginning  The truth is  Sales   Marketing at the top of the funnel have morphed  The whole org is working together on lead gen and demand gen  We re seeing more and more SDRs report to Marketing every day  The best sales and marketing teams are figuring out the numbers they need to back into for the year end goals  and work together to understand what amount of leads they need to hit for each market segment  and how acquire them  They work as a team   Some orgs are even ditching the MQL  Marketing Qualified Lead  and SQL  Sales Qualified Leads  acronyms and are going with a unified PQL  Product Qualified Lead   This makes total sense  as product company fit should be the be all end all  Stay tuned at SalesHacker com for more content on PQLs coming soon  We ll see more advancements come from this over the course of 2017   Texting  Yes texting  We re seeing more and more companies leverage texting in their sales processes  Some swear by it to confirm discovery phone calls  others use it to lock in deals and get the contract signed in the final stages   People are ditching their works phone lines  and direct dial numbers are pure gold  Buyers are even more routinely ignoring voicemail and are interested more in going by text  I for one  set my voicemail up to say  please do not leave a voicemail as I do not check it  Instead  text this number or email me    The one thing missing right now is that there s very few ways to log texts into Salesforce  I m not sure there s a standalone business here  yet   but it would be a valuable piece of a Salesforce logging platform  Text s place in sales is only going to grow   Predicting Predictive  Over the past few years  Predictive Analytics tools for sales has been a roller coaster  A few companies liquidated in the form of acqui hires  others just kind of went into slumber after big hires and large rounds raised  The hype train left the station here back in 2015  2016 was somewhat quiet  but I can tell they re beginning to come on strong again   A few that come to mind are Collective  i  and Everstring  Collective  i  uses the data from how a buyer buys  not how your team typically sells  Everstring uses the patterns that would make someone a likely buyer of yours  Both are taking a slightly different angle at how predictive works with your sales team  I ve been seeing positive results with companies using the newer predictive tools  More than when this popped in 2015   Acquisition Speculation  Ok so I brought up roll ups and massive acquisitions  but what s really going to happen  Who s buying the losers or laggards or just simply  the ones that aren t going to be first or second in their category  Vista scoped up Marketo and Cvent last year and should continue their buying spree  I wouldn t be surprised if Oracle started to get into the sales arms race  There s SAP too   Then Salesforce and Microsoft should end up playing offense and defense  This will make it interesting for bidding wars between the up and coming startups   Amazon and Google are sneaky dark horses to enter the race as well  Maybe IBM too   There s always smaller acquisitions to companies like CallidusCloud  Startups have lots of great options  But it s going to happen sooner than later   What worries me from a startup s perspective is the race to the bottom these big companies can create  They can acquire a company  and then bundle it into their package for next to nothing  So they can tell you we ll acquire you  or your competitor  but not both  And when we do  we ll give them out for free   Essentially Salesforce can do this with Wave when competing against Domo or Insightsquared  with Pardot when competing against Marketo or Hubspot  with SalesforceIQ when competing with Salesloft or Outreach  They make their money on the CRM licenses and use access to these platforms as an added perk   The counter argument that the startup has is that it would still cost you more time and more money to hire a consultant to set everything up  We ll see how this continues to play out in the marketplace   And Finally  Sales Hacker  We ve been around for about 3 years now  and are really excited about 2017  It s the first time we feel like we re ahead of the game  and understand our business and the marketplace  Like a startup  it takes a while to figure out what works and what doesn t  and where the market is going   We know our conference schedule  what virtual events we want

782,training-dataset/product/344.txt,product,Stripe s Everett Katigbak on how brand design supports productYour brand is much larger than any visual identity  voice or style guide  Ultimately  it s defined by what those on the outside say or how they feel   and that s a result of experiences inside and out of your product  Designer Everett Katigbak has spent his career building and shaping those experiences for some of the largest names in tech  Today Everett s focused on bringing Stripe s brand to life through film  print and interactive experiences  He was previously Pinterest s brand manager  following a lengthy stint as a member of Facebook s original brand design team  There  he co founded the Analog Research Lab  a print studio inside Facebook headquarters  which had a massive and lasting impact shaping and spreading the company s culture  Everett joined me on our podcast to explain how brand design supports product  the value of analog skill sets  how design can spread culture  and more  If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the interview  but if you re short on time  here are five key takeaways  Brand or communications design is about taking the emotion your product elicits and making it canonical so that it connects with someone at a personal  human level   Writing is a core tool for any designer  If you can conjure an image in someone s mind without visuals  your design work becomes inherently stronger   Brand design initiatives  like the Facebook Analog Research Lab  present internal communications opportunities that can help humanize technical and complex work   All people in product company can stretch their thinking by adding skills outside their comfort zone  e g  an engineer building analog objects or a designer learning to code   Having a collective design team  product and brand  in your startup s early days helps build a collective conscience  however  they ll need to scale independently as they begin to solve different problems  Stewart Scott Curran  Everett  thanks for joining us today  To get started  how did you get into tech and brand design  Everett Katigbak  I came here from the museum and exhibition design world  For the most part  I was doing a lot of physical and environmental design  Honestly  tech was the furthest thing from my brain  I loved the museum  It was a super fun and fulfilling experience  I knew I wanted to live in the Bay Area  Living in LA  I had gotten sick of sitting in the car and breathing all the smog  On top of that  I just wanted to see what else was out there outside of the museum  Which can get pretty repetitive  although each subject and each exhibition you do is pretty interesting  You start to fall into patterns  and doing the an exhibit is pretty straightforward  I started talking with as many people as I could up here   I was talking to Facebook and I talked to some friends at Google  There was something different about the people that I met at Facebook and I ended up getting an offer there  I didn t really quite know what to expect back then  Now I m at Stripe  I ve been there for just under a year  The company is growing pretty rapidly  It s been reinventing itself in the short time I ve been there  which has been pretty exciting  Before Stripe I was at a smaller startup called Shyp  trying to help them figure out their brand storytelling  Before that I was at Pinterest for quite a while  I was there when it was a really small company all the way up until it was a medium to large sized company  The true meaning of brand Stewart  You focus on communications design and brand design as opposed to product design  That label has been around for a while  but in terms of applying that to business problems  especially in tech  it feels like it s a fairly new thing  What does that label  communications design  mean to you  Everett  I ve always been more inclined to help with the narrative side of a company  A lot of the brand is experienced through the product  so people start to intuitively understand what the brand means  But at a certain point you need to start being more proactive and start shaping what that narrative is  For me  a lot of it is taking that feeling that you re trying to elicit through this thing you re building and just making it more canonical  A lot of the brand is experienced through the product  A friend of mine broke it down pretty saliently when he said   Product is about making something that s relatively universal to a broader set of people   You want to solve problems at scale  Brand and marketing is about taking that emotion or that feeling and then making it canonical   trying to make it really connect with someone at human level  which often is very specific and very personal  It s not really one or the other  they all flow together pretty naturally  at least in the early days of these companies that I ve been at  because there s a lot more access to the product team and the original or the early product development cycle  Stewart  You see a lot of blog posts that say that your brand is more than a logo or visual identity  What do you see as the core components of a brand today  How do you go a little bit deeper than that  Everett  This is the age old challenge for a designer  and it s constantly evolving  especially with new tools and new distribution channels for brands to get their message out there  Take the traditional identity of design  which used to be more what designers specifically thought of as brand  like   I ll make you a logo and I ll do these brand identity guidelines   That s about visual consistency  or even voice to a certain degree  There are a number of ways that people talk about brand  People say   It s a promise that your product or your company is building   or it s really about this deeper thing that you stand for as a company  The logo itself really is just a trigger  It s meant to remind people of these experiences and these narratives and all of these things that you re investing in as a company  these deeper things that you stand for today  It s meant to remind them of who you are and what you stand for and why they want to be loyal or support you as a business  Bringing your brand to life Stewart  At Stripe you re doing a lot more than just logo and color  You re working on bringing the brand voice to life through film  print  and interactive experiences  What are some of those things that you re doing to diversify the brand voice  and how does that play into Stripe s mission  Everett  Much of what I like to do is narrative driven  Even though I have a background and a training in visual design and communication design  I tend to think more about voice and story  I approach all of my projects and all the challenges that accompany them with that in mind  and then I have to figure out the right story we re trying to tell  Essentially  it s a strategic way to think about things  Then  once we start to figure out what that narrative is  I think about the appropriate medium depending on what our goals are  Video s often the way that I like to approach things because I m really interested in filmmaking  At the same time  sometimes it s interactive experiences  sometimes it s environmental design through events and things like that  I ve done a fair amount of all those things  and my personal interest never starts with one specific medium  It s really about diving into a story and then finding all these cool ways to get people to experience those  Stewart  Thinking about story and narrative  I know you write a lot as well  How does writing help with your design work and vice versa  Everett  Writing is core to my creative practice  It s not always consumer facing copy  Sometimes it has been  but for the most part  writing is the start of an idea for me  One of my mentors in school was this guy  Lou Danziger  He s a pretty legendary designer  Photoshop was starting to come out  and Illustrator too  People would ask him   What tool should I use   And he said   Microsoft Word is the most powerful design tool you could have   Microsoft Word is the most powerful design tool you could have  I really took that to heart  For me  all of my ideas and all of my stories start with free writing  I wake up every day  and I block it off on my calendar and will write for at least 30 minutes about anything just to keep those skills sharp  All the work that I do is about storytelling  but it s also just conjuring up an image in someone s mind  Writing is a way to do that without the visual side of things  so if you can really shape that  it will just make your visual work a lot stronger  Stewart  You were one of the original brand team members at Facebook  What was the state of Facebook s brand then you arrived  and how important should brand be to founders in a startup  especially the early days  Everett  Facebook was a really interesting company  and it still has a lot of the things that made it awesome  but also made it a crazy place  A lot of Facebook s brand really was tied to Mark Zuckerberg himself and these legends and stories that now are immortalized in movies like The Social Network  People couldn t really separate Mark Zuckerberg   this young  radical CEO   from Facebook s product and the experience  which was to build a useful communication tool that helps people connect with their families and friends and talk about our interests   From left  Mark Zuckerberg  Frank Gehry and Everett Katigback review environmental design at Facebook  Anytime they would do something product wise  people would essentially blame Mark  He had a lot of baggage in people s minds  It took a lot of work for them to decouple him from the product itself  As those two brands  Mark Zuckerberg s brand and the Facebook brand  became their own independent things  now you can see how Mark s brand has developed  He s starting to grow into his own as a legitimate world leader  He s a voice that a lot of people really look to  Then the product itself is able to exist without him having to do a lot of the heavy lifting  There are a lot of examples today  Look at Uber  A very similar experience  where people can t decouple the product from Travis Kalanick  the CEO  Whenever Uber does something  they re very quick to blame him  because he doesn t really have the trust of the people  How design can spread culture Stewart  As designers at Facebook in the early days you did a lot to help shape and communicate the culture there  You were one of the founding members of Facebook s Analog Research Lab  which is a great example  Why build a print shop inside a tech company  Everett  When we were trying to conceive this idea  it wasn t necessarily like   Let s build a print shop inside of this digital tech company   Ben Barry  co founder  and I were honestly just reverting to things we knew how to do as designers  I had come from LA where I was doing exhibition design  Ben came from Austin and he was actually working at a screen printing shop  We were in a sea of engineers  we were in a sea of web designers  and in some ways it was a comfortable way for us to assert ourselves because these were things that people didn t know how to do  It was really natural for us to start making stuff like that  and we just starting doing it,"[782 1169 609 1189 97 561 985 610 154 51 595]"
788,training-dataset/business/77.txt,business,How to Have Hard ConversationsHow do you tell a prospect something hard to hear without polarizing them especially if you re not naturally a  challenger  type person   In more subtle terms  a friend was asking me this over coffee recently when we were talking about varying sales styles   The level of aggression in your communication is something you can calibrate with the personality type of the person you re speaking with  The reality is that different people respond to different sales styles   Sometimes it makes sense to be a real challenger and flat out tell someone something that they might not want to hear   But  when you can tell that a prospect is more of a bulldog and seems to react defensively to this type of communication  it might be more effective to call upon a strategy I call conversational mirroring   What is conversational mirroring   It s a way to deliver a harsher statement by inserting exactly what you want to say to the person you re talking to in a story about another conversation   Doing this can convey the same sentiment without potentially polarizing sensitive prospects   Here are 3 situations where you can use this strategy   Telling someone they re missing the boat or big picture Bringing up competitors you already work with Letting someone know they re being cheap  Let s review examples of conversational mirroring in each of the context s outlined above   You re Missing the Boat  It can be frustrating when someone you re talking to just doesn t get it  Maybe they re old school or stubborn you know the type     Let s say you were selling a way for customers to dial directly from their computers and automatically log calls in Salesforce  Your prospect says that reps calling from a desk phone and manually logging is good enough  but you know that this type of thinking around skimming on the automation of trivial tasks given their call volume is backward   A direct way to counter this    The best sales organizations invest in automating low leverage tasks  You guys should really start to look more seriously at this if you plan on maximizing efficiency for each rep and becoming a modern a sales organization    I wouldn t be offended by this  but I certainly have had people react negatively to similar statements   Try using conversational mirroring instead    I was talking recently with  x company  and the main thing they wanted to know as an organization looking to turn into a modern sales organization was what maximizes the efficiency of each rep and gives each one the best chance to become a successful salesperson  I told them that the number one characteristic I ve seen across all of the best sales organizations  regardless of what they sell  is removing the time spent on low leverage tasks for each salesperson by investing in automation  These people understand that time spent with customers is way more valuable than things like administrative work  which is important  but just not as valuable as other    See the difference here   The person you re talking to still gets the message  but you re sharing it with them in a way that doesn t direct feedback squarely upon their shoulders   Working With Competitors  You should never be afraid to tell someone that their competition has selected you as a vendor conversational mirroring can just be a more elegant way to convey this   Let s say the relevant competitor is General Electric  Here is an example of a direct statement    We work with clients like General Electric and Best Buy  They see us as an easy way to make their sales team more productive    A statement using conversational mirroring    We had an internal review of why some of our best clients love us  and our Head of Customer Success brought up that one of the things General Electric really likes about our product is that it makes their team more productive and reduces the feeling amongst reps that they re doing busy work    In both statements you re trying to make the other person aware that you work with their competitor  If the person you re chatting with is defensive  sales styles like conversational mirroring can be a more elegant way to broach this circumstance   You re Cheap   There are two ways to think about someone being cheap   The first is that they are a legitimately penny pincher who doesn t spend money on important things   Alternatively  maybe someone is acting cheap because you haven t made it easy enough for them to understand that they ll recoup their investment quickly   In either case  you should always have a direct conversation about how to easily arrive at the ROI of your solution    If your reps save 2 hours a week  and can fit 3 demos in 2 hours  That s an additional 12 demos a month  Given your win rate  you should easily be able to recoup this investment back and then some in the first month      yadayada     A common situation when conversational mirroring can make sense is when someone isn t on board to move forward even when there is a clear ROI   One rebuttal to this behavior could be    I m confused given the information you provided  it seems like you d be making money by making this investment in your team    A similar way to convey the same sentiment using conversational mirroring could look like this    I had a conversation with one of our first customers and he told me how even though the value seemed like a no brainer  he was still hesitant because his reps don t like learning how to use new software  They are a very metrics driven  aggressive organization and he couldn t stomach the idea that he was likely leaving money on the table by not buying this so he decided to give us a shot  which he is now very happy about    In the second example  you re putting the same idea into your prospect s head  just in a much more indirect way   Anytime you start using conversational mirroring  you first and foremost need to understand the point you re trying to get across  A common sales communication mistake I see is people coming into these situations unclear on the 1 2 things they must convey before all else in order to steer the conversation in the right direction   Get clear on your most important messages and then think about elegant ways to handle touchy talking points like stock stories you can call upon when you need them   Click to tweet    Adding conversational mirroring to your sales style is like building a muscle  You need to just start getting used to saying  one thing so and so likes or I was talking to so and so  when bringing up talking points until it just becomes reflexive  Eventually you ll reach a comfort level where you just start using this frame on the fly   How do you think about incorporating different sales styles or developing your own  Let us know in the comments below,"[788 775 154 872 561 1316 1145 610 628 792 1360]"
789,training-dataset/business/1250.txt,business,Communication and culture   Several People Are Typing   The Official Slack BlogSlack 103  Communication and culture How to be a good citizen of Slack  After Slack 101 and 102  our final installment of the Slack onboarding series is about one of the most difficult aspects of adding people to your team  growing and maintaining your culture   Putting things out there  Slack is designed to add transparency to an organization  so it s best to default to communication in public channels whenever possible  Slack s own team sends tens of thousands of messages each week   in a recent summary  70  of those were posted in public channels  with 28  occurring in private channels and just 2  in direct messages  Posting messages in public channels means anyone in the organization can see what various teams are working on  see how much progress people are making on projects  and search the archive for context they need   Minimized disruptions  It s tempting to make sure no one misses your very important message  but it s courteous to refrain from notifying large groups of people if it s not truly necessary  We use  everyone    channel   and  here alerts  but rarely  because doing so sends a notification to a whole bunch of people who might not need it   In the past year and a half  I ve only seen an  everyone message pushed out twice during emergencies  Even though I follow hundreds of channels   channel is only used a few times per month for important announcements  Slightly more common is  here   which only pings members of a channel who are logged in  Pare it down even more with user groups  if I just need the people I work with directly to see a message  I alert  editorial team and spare the rest of the channel   Time and boundaries  It s a good idea to check the number of members in a channel  as well as the purpose in the channel info pane whenever you re going to ask a question or post a general comment   you want to make sure you re doing it in the right place  If it s your own team of  say  eight people  an off topic message won t be as big of an issue as if you re in a large channel with hundreds of members   There are many members here  so tread lightly  We ask everyone in busy channels to search before you ask  It s another way to be respectful of everyone s time  Spend a few minutes searching related channels for keywords around your specific problem  and chances are you might find your answer  or at least you ll be aware of previous discussions you can reference   The posting patterns of most teams at Slack vary throughout the day  In my own immediate team  we typically spend the first hour of the day planning  meeting  and sending reminders of project due dates  then our team channel goes mostly quiet until the afternoon  We close up each day by turning in work and getting feedback  but try to give everyone a few hours in the middle of the day to focus on work  It s not completely silent  and some work requires real time discussions in Slack for a decision  but our channels are slightly lower traffic between 10am and 4pm   Every team and company s workflow will be different  but we ve found it helpful to be clear about our communication expectations   For example  one of Slack s internal mottos is  work hard and go home  and we take it pretty seriously   almost all of us use the Do Not Disturb feature to protect our non working hours  which may vary for team members working in different roles  across time zones  or with different lifestyles   Our rule of thumb is if you need to send a message outside of the recipient s normal working hours  there is no expectation of an immediate reply  Generally  this is a good rule to keep  given the recipient of any message might be otherwise occupied   in a meeting  heads down on project work  or eating lunch   Redirecting  There s a saying at Slack that  all channels tend towards  random    We use the term  raccoon   and an associated custom emoji  to denote when a discussion should take place in another channel  In a busy general channel where someone is asking lots of very specific questions  it s not uncommon to see a message saying someone should  raccoon their questions to DM  or a specific team instead  It s not used to shame anyone  but instead to help teach everyone where a better place for the discussion might be  Here s a good example   Getting raccooned to a more specific channel   thumbsup   Over the past year since emoji reactions launched  we have adopted several ways of using them internally  Our most common use is polling or voting  We regularly ask in channels if everyone prefers option 1 or option 2 by marking each with a reaction  and decisions are quickly made as everyone s votes get tallied up   We ve also introduced a small workflow using reactions  Often someone will make a request and another person will  claim it  by marking it with the eyes emoji to say  I m going to take a look at this   Once the question is answered and the task complete  that same person will mark it with a white green checkmark to let members of the channel know it s done  If you leave your mentions and reactions activity sidebar open  you ll know the moment someone completes your request,"[789 678 552 51 1145 327 1316 799 609 1401 1390]"
792,training-dataset/business/1089.txt,business,We Tested The Response Times Of 433 Sales Teams  Here Are The Results We started running monthly webinars earlier this year at Drift   And as the list of monthly attendees quickly grew from 50 to 500 attendees  we needed to upgrade our webinar software   So I went to the website of the product we were using to try and add more seats   but there was no live chat option to send them a quick message  And then I searched around for a  contact sales  form   but no luck there either  My only option was to call sales   I typically avoid getting on the phone at all costs  unless it s my Mom calling  hey Mom  but I was in a pinch and needed to get our account upgraded ASAP   So I dialed the 800 number on the site  battled my way through a phone tree   and then a robot voice asked me to leave my name and phone number and someone would get back to me soon   Are you kidding me  What year is this   Since I was running a webinar the next day  I couldn t afford to wait  so I did a quick search  and ended up going with a different vendor at the very last minute   I found identical features  And the same exact price  But there was one big difference  my experience as a buyer   They got back to me faster   I connected with the second company instantly and made my purchase within minutes  Meanwhile  a sales rep from the other company didn t call me back until two days later  and now  of course  I can t escape the guy    I shared that experience with the rest of the team at Drift  and it got us thinking   If that experience was so bad and we were existing customers  how do businesses treat people who aren t customers yet  How do leads get treated in a world where buyers expect responses in real time  Do most businesses act like the second company I dealt with  Or the first     So using a secret shopper  we set out to fill out lead forms  demo requests  and sales inquiry forms for 433 B2B SaaS companies to see just how fast they are responding to their sales leads today   Here s what we found   The 2017 Drift Lead Response Survey  Highlights  Want to talk to sales  Get ready to fill out a form and wait  Only 7  of the 433 companies responded within the first five minutes   Only 7  of the 433 companies responded within the first five minutes  Hope you weren t expecting to hear back any time soon  More than half  55   of the companies did not even respond over the course of five business days   More than half  55   of the companies did not even respond over the course of five business days  The fast responders had a secret  Of the companies with the 10 fastest response times  all of them used live chat on their websites   Of the companies with the 10 fastest response times  all of them used live chat on their websites  And yet most sales teams still aren t using chat  Overall  just 14  of the 433 companies surveyed were using live chat   Click here to tweet about this survey   Our Take  In a world where we all using messaging apps every day  and 9 out of 10 people expect to be able to use messaging apps to communicate with businesses  only 14  of the B2B SaaS companies were using live chat   and that was reflected in the time it took them to respond  Only 32 of the 433 companies responded within the first five minutes   We used five minutes as a benchmark because that s the magic window for connecting with a new sales lead  after just five minutes  the odds of qualifying a new lead decrease by 10x  And in today s world  that can be the difference between a potential buyer going with your business   or bouncing from your site and searching for a competitor   But we know that it s unrealistic to expect your team to respond within five minutes with the tools that they re currently using   And that s exactly why a shift needs to happen in the way B2B companies do sales and marketing   Instead of relying on gated content  lead forms  and email nurturing campaigns  the best in class companies today are turning to messaging to match the real time nature of buyers today   Following up with someone a few days after they ve filled out a form is like ignoring someone that walked into your store   and then mailing them a postcard hoping that they ll come back and talk to you when you re ready   The best time to talk to someone isn t after they ve filled out a form  It s when they are live in your store  on your website   And with messaging  companies today have the ability to qualify leads in real time  So while your team might not be able to work 24 7  bots can help qualify leads in that precious five minute window and find the ideal customers for your business simply by asking the same questions a BDR might ask via email or over the phone   As the numbers show in this lead response survey  despite the fact that we all use messaging in our personal lives every single day  we re still in the very early innings of the shift to messaging for sales   But that just means there s a huge opportunity for the companies that are willing to move first  And the best part  It doesn t require a fundamental change to your business   it all starts with adding a second net to your current website,"[792 775 872 154 1390 327 511 1316 283 788 1145]"

founded a little snowball called UberCab  It was so early in Uber s existence he didn t even mention it   I notice Uber falls into a category of companies I call little snowballs  There are some fundamental features these companies have in common  I thoguht it might be helpful to list a few little snowballs and then talk about how you can go about starting your own   Uber  Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp commissioned the creation of a simple app that enabled users to hail a black car on demand  To validate they asked friends and colleagues to install the app  They hired a driver   watched what happened  After a few months of hustle the app hit 10 rides in one day   Airbnb  Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia bought a few airbeds and put up a static site called  Air Bed and Breakfast   They expanded the concept so that other people could offer airbeds in their homes and make money too  Then they expanded the idea to rooms  then to entire apartments  Their journey was a hustle from hell  but they made it happen   Google  Sergey Brin and Larry Page built a web search engine  It was one page with a search box and submit button  The backend was a simple database search returning ranked results based on the number of backlinks  It did a really good job at providing search results  and took off   Slack  Stewart Butterfield worked with his Tiny Speck group to build a better team messaging app  Slack makes it really easy for people to signup and start chatting as a team  At it s core Slack is a simple IM client   Other examples  AT T  Dollar Shave Club  Buffer  Shazam  DropBox  What is a Little Snowball    A startup that is founded to do one simple thing well  and that can be massively grown outward from that starting point    Typical markers   Very simple idea with a single facet  Extremely low product surface area  frontend and backend   Can generally be prototyped and brought to market in months  Is instantly useful and quickly gains early adopter traction  Each of these markers makes it considerably easier for you as a founder to start and grow the first version of your business   A Simple Single Facet  Just about every part of growing your business becomes easier if the foundational idea is do one thing well  I ve been part of a number of startups where it was almost impossible to explain what we do in a single sentence  This wreaks havok during sales meetings and investor pitches   However  when your startup is a single cell organism  customers and investors are not confused about what you do  Word of mouth and viral loop growth becomes significantly easier to achieve  You can focus on growing the business  rather than trying to understand what the business is   A Low Product Surface Area  This is a huge  almost unfair  advantage  Dollar Shave Club is the ultimate example  An idea you can build and launch in a weekend  Then  from Monday forward  spend all your time  effort and money on marketing and learning about your customers   I learnt this lesson the hard way  I lunched my tool Pluggio  a tool that buffers social content  at the same time as Buffer  Buffer focused on doing one thing well while I built Pluggio out to become a social media dashboard  Ironically  no matter how many features I added  Pluggio s main selling point continued to be social buffering   So  while I was adding 100k lines of code to make a really slick single page web app  buffer was marketing and integrating their very simple app  Due to my high product surface area my time was sucked up by support requests  Sales were harder because the product was harder to explain  Integrations were a non starter because the product was to complex   After 3 years Pluggio s yearly revenue was  50k and Buffer s was  1m   Fast to Prototype and Launch  The sooner you can get to market the sooner you can validate and start learning about how your customers make purchase or adoption decisions   Often times you can quickly validate a business by taking very manual steps that don t scale  For example  if you wanted to validate the business hypothesis   People will order coffee from a delivery app   you could get 250 500 business cards printed out saying   We deliver coffee  Call us on 123 123 1234    then hand them out at the mall at breakfast time   The very next day you will have some great information about your basic hypothesis   Build Something People Want  The final little snowball component is to make sure your core idea is something people actually want  Without that je ne sais quoi your rolling stone will gather no moss   How Can I Find My Own Little Snowball   Full disclosure  I am founder of Nugget  startup incubator   community   Our primary purpose is to help you find  and grow  your own little snowball   That said  here are some tips to help you come up with off the cuff ideas   Think Small  This sounds easier than it is  Many founders think at large scale because they want to build a Google or Uber  They feel it s too much of a gamble to think about smaller things  Another common trap is to get caught in the mindset of thinking more features equals more sales   To think small  you should notice details of everyday problems going on around you and try to find do one thing well opportunities   Notice Problems  Problems are everywhere  The trick is to open your consciousness to the stream of problems that life presents us with  You would be surprised at how capable we are of drowning out regularly annoying tasks that become part of our daily life  Now it s time to start to notice those things we ve trained ourself to ignore   One note about this  it s very important you solve a problem that other people have  That sounds like obvious advice  but if no one else has the problem  you re dead in the water   Look For Optimizations  Optimization essentially means   to make something better   and is really just another way to solve a problem  However  thinking through the mental model of optimization  can lead you to come up with some interesting product ideas   For example the core essence of Buffer is an optimization of Twitter   As a side note  Question  Why didn t Twitter simply add that feature when they saw it take off in Buffer  Hootsuite and other apps  Answer  They were too busy staying on task and building their own little snowball   Explore Old Ideas  You probably already have a number of ideas you ve been thinking about and possibly even products you ve launched  Have another look at them through the lens of what we ve discussed here  With any luck you might find a single facet that can be extracted from that old work and turned into a do one thing well little snowball          I m building Nugget  startup incubator   community   Nugget is

799,training-dataset/business/959.txt,business,We Need More Human One on Ones57 Flares 57 Flares    I still remember the day when I held my first one on one as a manager   I was nervous  I had read a dozen articles filled with advice from  let them lead the conversation  to  come prepared   I had a list of questions in front of me  all carefully worded to spark great discussion   When I finally sat down for my first one on one  I remember that we talked about some of the challenges he was facing at work  how he was feeling about his role and about his career at a high level  I felt pretty good about the ground that we covered  But one thing I never said out loud was   Let s forget about the business in these meetings and just focus on helping you be successful in your life    I had made a mistake  I d treated our one on one like it was just another meeting   Not Just Another Meeting  Most meetings are deliberately designed to serve the organisation s needs  They value efficiency  not reflection  The usual aims of one on ones are to maximise team productivity and to break down any barriers that might be in the way of this   This is out of balance  though  businesses are already great at taking care of productivity  What they don t do as well at is take care of their people  This is something that one on ones are uniquely capable of doing   so I think we need to treat them more like conversations and less like meetings   We ask more and more of the people on our teams  We want them to be creative  innovative  and willing to take risks  We want them to change the world and put a dent in the universe   As managers  it s important we acknowledge that these qualities can also take their toll on people  Constantly taking risks can be stressful and it s not uncommon for creative people to struggle with depression and self doubt  It s easy to find ourselves talking too much about projects and productivity and not enough about our lives  our worries  our hopes  and our coping mechanisms   At the same time  these are all qualities of being human  When we start to embrace more than just work in our one on ones  we re able directly to tackle root causes of any issues rather than trying to treat the symptoms  We can build up trust with the people on our team in order to help them become better at resting and coping with stress  so they feel more confident and relaxed  and learn how to balance their work with the complications that inevitably occur in their lives  This makes it possible for us to take better care of them and  ultimately  to take better care of our organisations as well   We can start to transform our one on ones so that they become a little more human  More human one on ones recognise that life doesn t always run smoothly and that the things that affect us outside of work can be just as important  or even more important  than what happens at work This approach lets us help people to succeed as people instead of as just employees   Let s throw out the traditional rulebook for meetings and redesign our one on ones for real life  People management should be recognised as a highly creative endeavour  and one on ones are one of the greatest creative works that managers get to produce   With that in mind  here are a few adjustments I d like to suggest we make to the way we approach one on ones   Assume by Default That People are Struggling  It s a rare moment in life when everything runs perfectly smoothly  If we want to have deeper  more human conversations  we need to move away from the expectation of a short or simple answer  Life is complex  and it doesn t always fit neatly into action steps   Take  for example  the issue of rest  Rest isn t just about getting adequate sleep and downtime  it s also the way that people become inspired and rejuvenate themselves  It s like the legs of a stool  it holds us up and supports us as we do our work   Any workplace that needs creative people also needs people with the ability to rest and recover their strengths and inspiration   As a result  rest is a skill that requires constant attention  like any other  Yet it still seems to be something that happens on the fringes of our lives  in the evening  on the weekends  or during the occasional vacation  It s not typically seen as part of the work domain  so it often goes unnoticed  The consequence is that we have people who are great at working but who don t know how to rest  Without the ability to rest properly  people are only able to bring their best effort forward in fits and starts  Doing great work becomes unsustainable  It s no wonder so many people burn out  We could instead take the opportunity in our one on ones to understand the ways that the people on our team rest and to encourage them to practise and to continually get better at it   Besides encouraging people to get better at resting  we can also make a slight shift to the way we frame our questions  Instead of asking   How are things going   try asking   What are you struggling with this week    By acknowledging that the answer won t always just be   Great   we can start to truly help our team overcome their challenges   Hold One on Ones According to the Need  not the Schedule  Life doesn t follow a schedule  so when we plan our one on ones in advance we end up holding them either too soon or too late   Let your team know that you want them to ask for a one on one when it feels like it might be most useful to them   and feel free to do the same yourself  You can set a recurring spot in your calendar that s open for anyone on your team  That way they can always set up a one on one for the next day or two at most   By having our one on ones ad hoc  we re able to treat them like a resource that can be called upon when needed instead of an obligation  This will help them feel fresh and invigorating  and you ll find that you don t need an agenda anymore because there will always be a clear purpose behind the meeting   Remember  If it s important enough to discuss in a one on one  it s important enough to discuss right away  People on our teams shouldn t have to wait a week or two to bring up big challenges or thoughts with us  This may require a little scheduling gymnastics  but it s worth it   Go Outside  When most people picture a meeting  they imagine a conference room  an office  or a quiet desk inside a building   These environments might be good for productivity  but they re not inspiring at all  They aren t conducive to having deep conversations where people need to get out of their day to day rhythm and recognise larger patterns   One quick way to start having more human one on ones is to start having them outside  You ll find it easier to expand your mind  to consider new possibilities  and to discuss larger issues  Being outside also reduces the pressure to answer every question right away  you become less reactive  You can look around  take a sip of your coffee  or stretch out before answering  It sets up a proactive  engaging environment   There s a great saying by French writer Antoine de Saint Exupery   If you want to build a ship  don t drum up people to collect wood and don t assign them tasks and work  but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea    If you want people to  long for the endless immensity of the sea  and not just fulfill a series of tasks  you need to get them to stop working inside the ship and bring them out to look at the ocean from time to time   Managers have a powerful opportunity to keep people inspired  But that s difficult to do if our most invigorating and meaningful conversations   our one on ones   happen in uninspiring places  require calendar reminders  and always revolve around projects and progress   We don t need to hide behind OKRs or metrics  Businesses have plenty of mechanisms in place to make sure that those are healthy  Let s reclaim our one on ones for the health of our team,"[799 1316 667 561 781 154 249 609 863 51 456]"
801,training-dataset/business/920.txt,business,Why I Only Work Remotely   NewCo ShiftGet Shift Done  Management  Why I Only Work Remotely  Building software for startups is a huge challenge  Not because writing the software itself is that hard  but most startups have managed to create the least optimal places to do work  In my 10  years of experience as a software engineer at startups  I cannot trust employers to provide me with an adequate work environment  and this holds me back from doing the best possible work for them  I am an ambitious  driven individual  and I want nothing more than to provide the places I work with my best possible output  I will give whatever company I am working at 100   Most of the places I have worked have done a great job at preventing me from doing this  That s why from here on out  I am taking a stand and drawing a line in the sand  Henceforth I will only work in a  remote  arrangement   Open offices  Most startups nowadays are obsessed with the open office environment  and it s nearly impossible to find companies that do not implement this type of layout  They ll claim it s because they want an  open and transparent culture   myth busted    but if you know anything about the subject  you ll know this is the worst possible setup for actual work  and doesn t improve communication or culture  You don t have to look far to find plenty of research on the subject  and quite frankly  there is simply no debate here  There is no evidence to support the hypothesis that open office layouts foster a more collaborative environment  Of course  office managers  CEO s and founders selectively ignore the mountain of evidence which disproves this hypothesis  This is one of the real tragedies of the startup world  It s hard to estimate how many startups are being held back by the obsession and group think around the open office environment  There is also the cost to the mental health of the employees who are subjected to these mad houses every day  As the startup scene continues to ingest  chew up  and spit out burn out young talent  there is very little by way of wisdom in the scene to help push back on issues like this  In the words of DHH   The open office plan is a tyrant of interruption  a deep loss of privacy  and the death of productivity   Work Hours  I am a night owl  You can tell me I have to have my butt in a chair within your line of sight at 8 or 9am  but that is very wasteful  You are wasting my time and yours  I am not a morning person  I will start being very effective around 11am and I really get going in the afternoon evening  If you force your preferred hours onto me  both employer and employee lose  You get less output out of me  Here s the cycle when I m forced to be in a chair in your office at 9am   I force myself to be up early and rush to work  feeling ill prepared  I try to focus and be effective in the morning  but struggle and the day is off to a bad start  killing my mood and momentum  I m tired in the afternoon and cannot work effectively at my peak work time  I drink tons of coffee trying to kickstart my productivity  I go home when I m finally starting to get going  I am restless in bed and can t sleep because I drank too much coffee and I m worried about getting up early  By the end of the week I am tired  frustrated  angry  and disappointed with my performance  It s a vicious cycle which has been hugely detrimental to my mental health and well being  This is another area where the science is very clear  there are morning people and there are night owls  You should accept your employees for who they are and optimize for their abilities  I am a night owl  always have been  always will be  I am done trying to work in the mornings   it is a waste of time as I am not effective and make more mistakes when I try to work at this time  I will only consider arrangements where I can control my work hours  This does not mean that I am lazy or a slacker  Far from it   I am frustrated that I cannot work at my peak productivity and I will not accept anything less than that from now on   Butts in seats thinking vs ROWE  ROWE  results only work environment  is a fantastic framework that needs to be adopted in places employing knowledge workers  You should be measuring the output of your workers  not the amount of time you can see them sitting in your office  I refuse to work in a place with such a cynical view of their employees  If you really think your employees will not be working if you cannot look over their shoulder to check  you have the wrong way of looking at the relationship with your employees  especially at a startup   You should be hiring people who are engaged by their work and believe in the company s mission  If people slack off when you aren t watching them  your company has a disease  and you have discovered a symptom  You cannot treat this symptom and expect the disease to be cured  More on this later  Remove the safety nets and let the bad actors fail    In the case of working from home remote work  some employees do not do their best work from home  or simply don t like it  That is fine   but you should trust your employees and treat them like adults  Let them make the call for themselves  Remove the training wheels and let them fail  If they cannot succeed in a hands off environment  do you really think babysitting them is going to work   Culture doesn t grow because of an unblinking gaze by a manager with direct line of sight over his underlings  Quite the contrary     David Heinemeier Hansson  Remove the safety nets and let the bad actors fail  In  Introduce Process Only As A Last Resort   we look at how process often times helps the bad and hurts the good  Bad actors in an organization will figure out what the rules and the process are and follow them to a letter  Then they ll find a way to slack off within these boundaries  Even if we wanted to  we can t write a rule that will magically make people engaged  We have to compel them by building a workplace they love and can do great  meaningful work in  Without tons of rules and process  it becomes very obvious who cares about the organization and who does not  thanks to the lack of rules   process and not because of them  It s the same reason that communism does not work nearly as well as capitalism   things work best when you give people freedom as individual actors   If you are looking at your employees through the lens of  I can t give these people freedom and autonomy to do work in the best way they see fit   You should consider finding different people for your organization instead of pursuing an authoritarian regime   In summary  I pride myself on being a great employee  I want to do great  meaningful work  I want to make an impact  I want to be part of a team that does great things  I love writing great software and I want to do it with fantastic people  It seems that I ve reached a turning point in my life where I ve realized that in order to do these things  I need to open a new chapter and set new boundaries in the work arrangements I can accept,"[801 456 1316 313 609 667 799 863 1390 1145 561]"

mistakes that many founders make when carring out an email marketing campaign   When done right  email marketing can improve any type of business  It can improve a brick and mortar business  like a restaurant that sends its subscribers menus and coupons  and it can improve an e commerce business that sells a product or offers a virtual service   While many entrepreneurs have heard about the benefits of email marketing increased sales  building a relationship with an audience over time  and effortless branding not all email marketing campaigns are successful   Sometimes  the problem is a simple one  not enough traffic  Fortunately  lead generation to a landing page is not as difficult as you might imagine  There are many third party services that do all the heavy lifting for you so you can focus on improving conversions when people do show up on your landing page  Horizon advertising and email lists demonstrate the kind of service that helps entrepreneurs generate leads for their business   If email marketing is a proven way to build a business  why do only a few people who strive to build a home based business have success with it  And it s not just the solopreneur who struggles with email marketing  so do businesses of all types and sizes  Does this suggest that the email marketing model is broken   Is the Email Marketing Model Broken   If the model were broken then nobody would be successful with it  Moreover  those who have found success with it acquire such astonishing success that they boldly claim that  the money is in the list    Here s the thing  the problem is not in the model itself  but in the business owner s application of it  The Email Marketing Model  Statistically  44  of email recipients make at least one purchase every year from a promotional email   Marketer s Results  40  of marketers say that they don t get a positive return on the time and money they invest in their email marketing campaigns   The problem is not the model  but the errors people make when applying the model   5 Common Email Marketing Mistakes  With that in mind  let s take a look at some of the errors marketers make and how to fix them   Problem  1  Beginner s Mistakes  Beginners make many mistakes that would shock a seasoned marketer   1  They send their marketing emails from their personal email account  Sending promotional emails from your Gmail  Yahoo  or Bing account is probably the biggest mistake you can make  This only works for one on one communications  but it does not work for mass communications  Most of your messages will be flagged as spam and you will be seen as a rank amateur by your recipients   2  They send marketing emails without asking for permission  Recipients are guarded about their inbox and when they see an email from an unknown marketer  it is immediately marked as spam   Use a professional email provider service that can deliver emails to tens of thousands of people without any problems  Your emails will get delivered and they will get read   Problem  2  Sending email to a bad address   While a professional email provider service will take care of the delivery for you  it s up to you to keep your list clean  Over time  you will develop a list of bad addresses  People either gave you a bad email in the first place or they have since abandoned their email account   There are two reasons why this is bad for your business   1  You are paying for the number of people on your list  So you re paying more for having an inflated list with bad addresses   2  Your sender s email will eventually be blacklisted by the major personal email providers like Google and Yahoo   You can clean up your list by using a tool like LeadSpend who offer a comprehensive solution to identify the validity of an email address  You ll not only improve your sender reputation  but you will improve your chances of running a profitable campaign   Mistake  3  Bad messaging  A long  rambling email is usually deleted within seconds  If you want to get people to read your entire email and to click on a link  you must use copywriting techniques  You can either learn how to be a good copywriter or hire someone to write your emails for you  It will make a huge difference in your open  click through  and response rates  When it comes to poor messaging the biggest mistakes are hyped up promises in the subject lines  heavy handed sales promotions in the body  and rambling content pieces that offer little to no value  Poor messaging is a sure way to motivate people to unsubscribe from your list   Mistake  4  Poor formatting  You should use the right formatting for your emails  This means paying attention to the width of your emails  which should be a 600px maximum width  You also want to use plenty of paragraphing  If you send an email that is a solid body of text  it will get deleted fast even if you have written a brilliant email   Mistake  5  Not building a relationship with subscribers  A common mistake is constantly pitching subscribers in every email  You have to work out a ratio between content emails and promotional emails  By constantly pitching your list  you will quickly burn it out   Email Marketing Works When Done Right  The only way to get good at launching email marketing campaigns is to constantly test and tweak your messages  Financially  every dollar you spend earns

833,training-dataset/business/653.txt,business,Q A  How to get better at public speakingThis week  one of our readers emailed us to ask    What advice would you give someone who s just getting started with public speaking    There s a lot to this question  so I ll break into a few areas   Pick your topics wisely  You should only choose topics where you can speak with a good degree of confidence  and that your audience will want to hear about  Beware of events that would require you to drop one of these requirements   Confidence usually comes from both research and experience  For folks early in their career this means deep talks on specific areas  rather than broad  state of the nation  type talks that require a lot more credibility to pull off  For example  if you re an engineer early in your career don t try to give a TED style talk about  How software engineering is changing the world   The likelihood of you delivering that with credibility and impact is pretty low  Instead  start with a specific topic where you have credibility e g  a library  a language  a method  etc   With a few notable exceptions most talks will either be deep or broad  and educational or inspirational  With enough time and experience a great speaker can leave you with all four  but they tend to be rare  The biggest mistake here is not making a choice at all   Get comfortable with small empty rooms  My earliest public talks were to groups of 20 to 40 people  often less  It s certainly not what you dream of  but it s an important stepping stone  You re gonna screw up early on  so best do it in front of a small group of people  not at an event live streamed to thousands   These events are where you can make your mistakes and learn the arcane Keynote knowledge  It s where you learn things like how HDMI to Mini DisplayPort cables will break and where to buy a replacement with an hour to go  what to do when your laptop is low on battery during a presentation  how to use Keynote Presenter View  and why you should never rely on Speaker Notes   Build your own social proof  You can actually build your own speaking resume without having a stage  Blog posts are a great way of doing that  A lot of the time when I m speaking  it s actually blog posts turned into a presentation  or vice versa   As examples  Ryan Singer and Benedict Evans have given great talks to their laptop and published it online  So when people tell me they can t find their  first speaking event   I tell them it s right in front of them  A talk like Ryan s or Benedict s has instant global distribution and undoubtedly gets them more requests as speakers   Having material like this to point to also means when you ask somebody to speak at their conference or meetup you can clearly say   Here s the type of topics I can cover   Recording them also also helps you cut out the  ums  and  ahs  and polish your delivery a lot   Public speaking isn t about the slides  There is a broken assumption that public speaking means a deck of 20 slides and a glowing screen behind you  Many times you don t need any slides at all  you might just need one image or some bullet points on a piece of paper  In fact  an over reliance on slides will take the power from your message  Just look at what happens when you put The Gettysburg address into Powerpoint,"[833 478 505 553 154 986 1316 561 295 380 1360]"

an overhaul  As the agency s de facto CMO and former head of marketing for Google X  Gianfredi needed to figure out how to tell the new org s story in a way that would attract top technical talent away from Google  Facebook and the like  Sure  USDS had been hailed in Fast Company and elsewhere as President Obama s elite startup squad building a better government with tech  But anyone who went to its website saw something much more bland and bureaucratic    We completely redid all the content   the language  the tone  the design   and we felt really good about it   Gianfredi remembers   But because this is the federal government  we had to vet every piece of content through multiple stakeholders   communications  ethics  policy   and there was a ton of debate on what was acceptable  Many changes were requested  We wanted to say no  We couldn t  It was the world s best exercise in adaptability    That word has become key  not only for Gianfredi  but for all USDS team members who often parachute into long standing agencies  think the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs  to shake things up and build new systems  Of course  adaptability doesn t always mean being overruled  But it does mean listening  adjusting  and trying again in a very specific way   a way defined by learning and resilience  Used correctly  it s a tool that helps you win over time and with grace    Every act we take at the U S  Digital Service these days is an act of adaptability   she says   We thought USDS was going to be about the government adapting to new technology  But more than half of it is us adapting to the culture of government and how it works  A lot of process and policy is there for a reason  But we only find that out when we ask and push    This is a familiar experience for a lot of startups  Maybe it s not government they re dealing with  but it s certainly the culture of often monolithic industries they re trying to change   whether it s energy or banking or even food service  It s doubly true for companies operating in regulated environments   We have to adapt to what s already in place in order to push it forward   says Gianfredi   Adaptability is being told no and figuring out what s next  It s not just about beating your head against the wall  It s asking why the wall is there  What s it holding up   In this exclusive interview  she draws on her experience working at the White House  to offer all startup professionals a clearer window into what adaptability means and how you can cultivate it in your own companies and careers   WHAT ADAPTABLE PEOPLE DO  The first step to building an adaptable team is to isolate the qualities of adaptable individuals  Because USDS depends on technology professionals serving tours of duty sometimes as short or three to six months  Gianfredi has seen a breadth of people come through and either adjust flexibly or not   allowing her to build a profile of adaptable professional    Surprisingly  the number one quality is that they re stubborn   or  as you might put it  determined to the point of stubborn   she says   They re the person who tells you that there s a solution to every problem  In an interview  they ll use words like that  Uniquely  they might not know what precisely needs to be done   but that can be good because they aren t overly committed to one path  They know there will be dozens of hurdles  but they never let go of what they re running toward    Stubbornness manifests as an unwillingness to give up  This doesn t mean it has to always go their way  or that they re uncompromising  Rather  they ll bend and change course in service of the North Star that they ve selected for themselves  They ve been able to clearly articulate what the end objective is and why they re passionate about it  They ll do what it takes to get there   Adaptable people have to be optimistic  I don t think anyone who s adaptable lacks this trait    Why would you keep struggling so much if you didn t believe in your eventual success   Gianfredi says   Look for people who believe in themselves and their goals so much that they ll tell you   Of course there s a way   It s not just that they believe in their solution  they believe in their own ability to come up with another solution that will get the job done    When interviewing for adaptability  you want to look for this type of self belief reflected in past experiences  When did the person forge ahead with a plan against the odds or when it was risky  When did they assume responsibility for the success of a project because it mattered to them so much  When did they take on a leadership role because they trusted themselves to do it right  Ask them these questions  Adaptable people will have top of mind answers that showcase not only their self belief  but the awareness that that was crucial to their success    Adaptable people are incredibly supportive of others   they do it because they want to  because they derive enjoyment being helpful  and without need for reciprocity   Gianfredi says   If you want to build a team that can pivot and stay nimble and recover from failure  you need to stack it with people who have demonstrated above and beyond support of colleagues or friends in the past  Working on a team like this means that people have to spend a lot of time picking each other up  They have to spend a lot of time listening to each other about how bad that meeting was  or how frustrated they are or what went wrong that day  It has therapeutic value that fortifies everyone  It s something I see every day at USDS   not people complaining  but leaning on each other in a way that makes it possible to get out there and do it all again tomorrow    This level of support also cultivates trust   another must if a team is going to adapt successfully  People can t be tripping over each other  They can t be wasting time on territorial disputes or political concerns  They have to be able to divide and conquer  and trust each other to do the best possible job   The key to this is to let people share their successes and failures in a way that s not overproduced   she says   When you make a big deal out of it  it seems less genuine or less honest  Carving out more unstructured social time  where leaders set an example of confiding in the team about their wins and losses works the best in my experience   The only way someone is going to adapt to their own wins taking months or years  is if they know that s how it went for someone else they really respect   Adaptable people gravitate toward diverse teams  And this doesn t just refer to race or gender  It means a variety of backgrounds  family structures  childhood experiences  educational pedigrees  former industries  They generally like being pushed out of their comfort zones in a way that changes their view of the world and forces them to accept new thinking  They like to be challenged by the unknown and nudged out of their status quo  Being in an environment with people radically different than themselves reliably delivers this experience   Again  if you re looking to hire adaptable people  you might ask in an interview  How diverse have teams you ve worked on been  How were they diverse   You want people to recognize the influence of disparate backgrounds   When did your colleagues challenge to accept different points of view based on their personal experiences and what did you think of that  When have you been pushed the farthest outside your comfort zone in a work context  When has someone else s perspective meaningfully changed a strongly held opinion of yours   If you re running a startup  you dwell in a reality of constant change  For most people  this is really exhausting  It requires constant revision of beliefs  habits  ideas  Your goal as an organization should be to build teams that find constant change to be exhilarating   not scary or tiring  Do they gain energy and momentum  Do they expand and brighten  Or do they contract and seem more deflated telling the story   Janine Gianfredi  Lastly  adaptable people practice in their personal lives   Usually  it s a positive indicator if we re talking to someone who said they taught themselves how to code or to cook or to rock climb   says Gianfredi   For me  it was yoga that challenged me to do something regularly that I hadn t done before and to push my boundaries just a little bit in my everyday life  People who do things where they regularly fail and try again outside of work   they re much more likely to adapt  It seems like a small thing  but gradually  you re normalizing being flexible  being okay with discomfort  trying new pathways to the same destination    The cool thing about this quality  is it s also a tactic for growing your adaptability if that s an area you want to work on  It might not seem like fixing bikes or trying to do a longer handstand has anything to do with your ability to be gritty on the job  but you re using and exercising the same neurons  Doing one in your personal life will strengthen your ability to withstand pressure and innovate in the toughest of quagmires at work   ADAPTABILITY S ENEMIES  There are three things that Gianfredi has seen kill adaptability stone dead faster than anything else   Hierarchy  This one isn t so surprising  and it s clear how she s discovered this  having come up against government bureaucracy at its thickest and least wavering  But she also believes this happens at startups much more easily than people think  and before anyone notices  To keep pernicious hierarchy at bay  she recommends looking out for these early warning signs   Your CEO has become more of a persona than a person  People poke fun at or commonly discuss only his or her key traits  without real knowledge of who they are or what they care about   People are less approachable  You or your colleagues find yourself hanging back from going up to someone in person  or fish for any alternative to asking for help   More people start troubleshooting on their own rather than casually socializing problems with their teammates or friends to find a quicker answer  This happens because they feel like they can t afford to be wrong or they ll lose ground in their org   Slowly but surely  hierarchy squeezes adaptability out of any team  The culture becomes brittle as people become less risk averse   afraid of losing their place in the pecking order   people know and trust each other less to come up with collaborative solutions  and they stop valuing the reward of good ideas or problem solving over material or professional gain  It s a killer   Conflating process with bureaucracy  They aren t the same things   In order to be anti bureaucratic  a lot of small companies and orgs throw away all process  They say they don t want red tape  they ll just stay flat   says Gianfredi   What they don t realize is they re often making their lives harder than they need to be    Bureaucracy refers to unnecessary rules that flow down an organization without adding real benefit  Process can offer massive benefit   For example  documenting tools people should use and methods that have been proven to work can accelerate a lot of productivity  reduce duplicative efforts  save time  and more  Office hours and stand ups  when conducted in this spirit  can do the same thing    Remember  adaptability takes a lot of energy   you have to be actively conscious of preserving your team s energy so they can adapt   she says   A lot of process can be used to cut out steps and make things clearer to save a lot of this energy    USDS saw this play out in extreme fashion  Of course the knee jerk reaction to working with the federal government was to avoid bureaucracy at all costs  Whenever anyone proposed a new system or process for escalating issues  or even the simplest of policies  there d be a backlash  Gianfredi agreed to a large extent  until she saw the need for process in action    We re a lot different from other government agencies in that we love our team members to talk about what they re doing all the time   at events  to the press  on Medium  Honestly  I d love to see the government put more real people forward to talk about why they value their work   she says   But I did realize how hard this was to organize    In short order  she learned there needed to be a balance between stringent talking points and radical candor    So we started writing down rough rules around when someone should speak or publish  how they might express interest in it  and how they might get the support they need to feel comfortable about it   says Gianfredi   Yes  it was definitely process  Now we re at a point where people need approval before speaking or publishing  but it actually saves everyone time  No one has to be scared  It made life easier    Don t make bureaucracy and process synonymous  You ll be cheating yourself out of efficiencies you don t even spot yet  because you re ironically so locked into a mentality of remaining  flexible    Saying nothing after  no   U S  Digital Service  employees hear this word a lot  Government projects are complicated  with many interdependencies   things change a lot  and the team experiences pushback regularly  Their first recourse  naturally  is to not take no for an answer and try to push ahead another way  But sometimes a  no  stands firm  This can be crushing  but it doesn t have to mean total failure with zero gain  Adaptable organizations always make sure something comes after  no   Most of the time  this should be a credible  complete answer to the question   Why   Fortunately  and perhaps surprisingly   this actually does happen at many government agencies    Sometimes when we get told no and ask why  the answer is really really good   says Gianfredi   We work with people who have been in government for 30 years  but they re also reformers trying to get stuff done  They ve just seen a whole lot and know what works and what doesn t  So we have to really listen and seek to understand  The worst is when we don t even have the chance to ask  Why     You want to build a team where it s always possible to get back to the source of a decision   It can be even harder to clear a pathway to  why  at startups  Everyone is moving so fast  Time is scarce  There s no room for asking questions  Just accept the no and move on  people think  This isn t good and it will start hurting your ability to adapt  People have to be able to get to the source of a  no   fully understand it  and determine whether they can approach from another angle   On top of that  sometimes even questioning a  no  topples it  Maybe it was based on a myth  or on  the way things were always done   If you can tear down false reasons for  no   you ll have increased your org s adaptability by an order of magnitude  If anyone at your company says there s no time to ask questions  especially  Why   that s your canary in the coal mine  Make sure there s always at least one conversation after  no    THE RIGHT HABITAT TO ADAPT  So now you have adaptable people  and you know what to watch out for  how can you create an environment every single day where adaptability is celebrated and thrives  Here are the attributes that Gianfredi has seen adaptable orgs have in common   They have great documentation of what went wrong    If people in your org can point to the things  the moments  the decisions that didn t work well and what happened afterward   how everyone recovered  or figured out a different way or got around something   you re in really good shape   she says   If  on the other hand  everyone is just positive and you re only dissecting the wins  you re not helping yourself   Whenever something goes wrong or fails spectacularly  investigate and write it down  You re giving the future of your business a blueprint for how to be flexible and adapt to the next stage   People ask questions at inappropriate times   This is really a bellwether for whether you have a rigid or inquisitive culture at work  Don t look only at how often people ask questions  but actually when  Are people so comfortable being curious and questioning authority that they ll interrupt a staff meeting or blurt something out during an All Hands  This is actually a sign of health  of people proactively pushing back and wondering how things work   Start counting the number of questions that get asked in your regular staff meeting  and set a threshold for yourself   says Gianfredi   Is this number fluctuating  Make sure it doesn t go down over time    Employees have ample opportunities to stretch their minds outside of work   This doesn t necessarily mean some crazy offsite where everyone has to learn to potato sack race or garden  In fact  groupthink activities like this don t fit the bill  Instead  you want to give people the time and space to pursue hobbies they individually value   This is something I really respect about the culture at USDS People work really hard  but they have boundaries and feel like they can pause and have something else significant that they re working on in their lives   This maps to firing up those neurons of adaptability mentioned earlier  The best environments encourage goal setting and pursuit outside the office   They have values that point to the next step   This dovetails with having something come after  no   Too many startups create a list of  core values  that simply reflect the qualities they like their employees to have  But creating values is really an opportunity to help guide people through the way you want them to make decisions and adapt to situations that arise  For example  the U S  Digital Service values are   Hire and empower great people   Go where the work is   Find the truth  Tell the truth   Design with users  not for them   Optimize for results  not optics   Create momentum   Each of these serves as a signpost keeping people on course if they hit a roadblock or closed door  It all starts with hiring the right people who are passionate and motivated to do the work  But  for example  if you have a hard time getting to the cold  hard truth of a situation  the next best step is to look to end users and what it is they truly want  Then  the best way to serve them is to keep positive outcomes for them in mind  not how it will look otherwise internally or externally  Lastly  the value to  create momentum  reminds everyone to stay biased toward action even if the inertia of working at the federal level can seem overwhelming  There s always new ways to create momentum and break new ground   We want our values to remind people what they should do next to keep moving forward

868,training-dataset/business/1038.txt,business,How To Get A Story Featured In Entrepreneur MagazineIn the January edition of Entrepreneur Magazine  there s a story titled  Would You Open Your Books    p 20   I pitched that story to the editor six months prior   My first pitch to him failed  The second one got featured in the magazine  This article shares why my second pitch got featured while the first flopped   If you are an entrepreneur  a PR person  or a growth hacker looking to get the attention of press  this article explains what you need to know to get your story featured by media outlets              How do I get your attention to get a story featured in Entrepreneur Magazine    I was sitting at a large conference table with nine other people  To my left was Jason Feifer  Editor in Chief of Entrepreneur Magazine   We were at two 12  a small event in Boulder   which turned out to be my favorite event of 2016    Jason was the star of this breakout session  Essentially  if anyone knows about media  it s him  He has worked for The NY Times  Washington Post  GQ  Slate  ESPN  and more  And now as the Editor in Chief of Entrepreneur  he s responsible for selecting the stories that  make the cut  into the magazine each month   One feature in his magazine could be worth tens of thousands of dollars to a company  So every day he fields hundreds of spammy cold emails from overly ambitious entrepreneurs  startups  and PR companies all trying to steal his attention and get a featured article    Thank God I m not an editor    Like any ambitious entrepreneur  I wanted to know how this PR game actually works   We were gathered around him at the conference table like children at a campfire  waiting to hear his sage wisdom  his stories  and his ideas on doing PR right    There are two approaches that never work for getting press   The first strategy everybody tries and it always fails  assigning your PR role to an intern  Entrepreneurs do this because they don t have a clue how to pitch media and they think and intern can figure it out  This is the worst  Don t waste your time or energy with this approach   The second strategy that never works  hiring a PR company to send an email blast to 100  different media outlets at once  I can sense when its an intern pitching or when a PR company sent an email to me and countless other media outlets and I immediately delete any emails like this     The one thing everybody tries and it never works  assigning your PR role to an Intern    He continued    The problem is  people don t think like an editor  They re stuck thinking about their own business  The truth is  we re not interested in your business  We re interested in stories that captivate people  We re interested in covering what s new  hot  and story worthy   The more you can start thinking like an editor and tie your story into a current trend or something fascinating already happening in the market  the more likely you are to get my attention   Don t pitch us on your business  pitch on something bigger that s happening in the world  Then show us how you fit into it    That was when it  clicked  for me  I always thought about my business first and the  story  second   I d focus on what I wanted to highlight in my business and tried to make a story around that  Jason was saying to do the opposite   Lesson One  Discover  the story  happening in the world first  Then decide how your business fits into it   Genius   This concept was the reason my second pitched got featured  more on that in a sec   But I still wanted more   What I Learned About Cold Pitches From Scrolling Through The Inbox Of The Editor Of Entrepreneur Magazine  I was impressed with Jason s insight  But it didn t give me the answer I was looking for   I still wanted to know how to get the attention of an editor as busy as him  So I pressed a little more    I m curious what email subject lines you open versus ones you immediately delete   Would you open your phone and read us some of the subject lines you ve read in the past 24 hours so I can hear which ones you opened and which ones you immediately deleted    The room became charged with anticipation  The greedy marketers were salivating at the prospect of learning what subject lines actually captivate someone as busy as Jason   He pulled out his phone and started scrolling    Ahh   here are some bad ones    And he rattled off a list of examples of people writing blanketed  press releases  that follow a format similar to  New Startup Announces  Insert Boring Idea Here      Anything like that immediately gets deleted  Sometimes I don t even finish reading the whole subject line    Then he showed a few of the emails he did open   Almost all of them were written directly to him  No mass email list  No vague subject line   They were written specifically and directly to him  Anything else was deleted  almost immediately   Think about it  Imagine getting literally hundreds of emails clouding your inbox every single day all from people who want something from you  He HAS to filter quickly for what s personal    How Jason doesn t hate people at this point is beyond me    But here s what fascinated me even more   In one email  a person wrote a sincere personal pitch and asked for feedback because he wasn t getting results   It was a simple sentence that said something like   And if this pitch isn t a fit  would you mind giving me feedback on how I could improve it or make it better for the Entrepreneur audience    Jason showed us how he responded by giving the guy some advice  I was completely blown away by that   First  by his generosity  And second  by the psychology of how I could use this as a strategy   If you send a truly personal pitch and include some sort of PS asking for feedback  you ll likely increase your odds of getting a response  And they might tell you exactly what you need to say for your next pitch to land   Again  Genius  This session was really paying off   But what s even better is what Jason shared next   As he scrolled through his emails  he read one subject line  opened it  and said   Oh   yeah  I ll almost always open an email with this subject line     Oh   yeah  I ll almost always open an email with this subject line     Subject  Met you at ____   It was an email from someone who met Jason at a conference a few years back  He was following up and sharing a pitch that was relevant now   Jason treats his personal network and contacts with an incredible amount of respect  so he always wants to respond to people he s met in person  That s why this subject line works almost every time   File that away in your memory bank for future emails    And notice how I used that subject in the screenshots below    How I Bombed My First Pitch  And What I Changed To Make Pitch  2 A Winner   We finished our hourlong breakout session  and as we were shuffling out of the room  I tried to soft pitch Jason    I run a company called The Foundation  we help entrepreneurs get started in business  We ve had all sorts of businesses be spawned from our little accelerator and many people have quit their jobs  are traveling the world  and are doing work they love now   One is making six figures from proofreading  Another is helping authors publish books  Another is making  25K mo selling chocolate covered bacon  Would any of these stories be a fit    Last year I made friends with a writer at Business Insider who featured a handful of our Foundation students in articles using this same angle  I thought it d work for Entrepreneur  too    Eh   I don t really see anything there  Those stories are happening all the time right now  There s not much of a story there    Shut down   I felt like an idiot  He just spent an hour teaching me EXACTLY how to pitch him  and there wasn t the slightest bit of curiosity about my pitch   fail  Didn t I learn anything   I spent the next few hours going over my notes and brainstorming different ideas and angles  If I couldn t successfully make a pitch to Jason in person  how could I possibly succeed over email   I finally thought of a story worth pitching and  before the final keynote of the day  I noticed Jason sitting at a table   Thinking about my last embarrassing pitch  I swallowed my pride and approached him    Hey Jason   I ve been thinking about your session and I think I ve got another story for you  Interested in hearing a quick 30 second pitch     Sure     Are you familiar with  open book management      Kind of  but tell me more      Open books  is a management philosophy where you share your revenue and expenses with your employees so everyone knows how much money is coming in and out of the business  Less than 5  of companies are open books  but the ones that are consistently tend to perform better  And  as the world trends towards more transparency  we re seeing more businesses use this like Buffer  ConvertKit  Smart Passive Income  Entrepreneur On Fire  Groove and more   All these entrepreneurs are sharing their books publicly with the world so everyone knows what s happening     Hmm  That s interesting  Here s my email  Would you mind following up with me after this event and sharing this over email     Of course    Notice the difference in my pitches   The first pitch still focused on my company  Not the overall trends in business   The second pitch  I focused on a trend already happening among many companies  And I shared how I fit into that trend   That made all the difference  But it didn t seal the deal   After I got Jason s attention and permission to follow up  the follow up began   Notice the subject line   As expected  it got a quick response   I ended up in a private Facebook group with Jason for the 212 alumni  He asked for feedback on cover variations of Entrepreneur magazine  After sharing my thoughts  it gave me the perfect window to ask for a quick follow up   A few weeks later  a reporter reached out to me  We scheduled a Skype call and he grilled me with questions and asked for introductions to other businesses   A side benefit of pitching stories to reporters is that you can also get your friends featured like Alex from Groove  Pat from SPI  and Nathan from ConvertKit   Clint and I hopped on Skype and I told him everything I knew about open books  who was doing it and how he could learn more   A few months later  the story ran in Entrepreneur Magazine   There you have it   From nothing  To bombing a pitch  To getting his attention  Following up  Getting interviewed  And watching the story go live   When I reflect back on this whole process  there are five rules I learned to remember anytime I pitch stories to media in the future   Five Rules To Remember Before You Pitch A Journalist Anything  1  Think Like An Editor And Pitch  The Story  Before Pitching Your Business   No editor cares about you  or your business  or your next big idea  They care about stories that captivate  entertain  and show trends  Don t focus on pitching your business  Focus on pitching trends that are happening in the world and then show how your business fits into that trend   2  Know The Values Of The Publication   Different publications value different things  Business Insider ran features on our students because they valued running a series of articles about entrepreneurs who quit their job to travel the world and are making money following ideas they love  Our stories were a perfect fit for Business Insider  But that idea didn t fly with Entrepreneur  Know your audience  Know what they value by studying the types of articles that get the most traction on their site   3  Write Emails Specifically To Each Journalist   If you write one email to multiple people  you have a VERY small chance of getting any response  This isn t the place to try  the shotgun approach   Instead  be a sniper  Focus on a smaller group of people but laser in your messages so they re personal and entertaining  The more personal  and the more you can show you ve done your research by knowing what stories click with their audience  the more likely you ll get a response   4  Always Follow Up   90  of people never actually follow up and almost always lose opportunities because of it  People are busy  Ideas slip through the cracks  Following up is useful to a busy person  I love it when people circle back with me  Especially if I asked them to  I followed up with Jason three times over a period of months before the article went live  Be patient  But always follow up   5  If Your Pitch Isn t Working  Genuinely Ask For Feedback   If you re trying your pitch and getting nowhere  ask for feedback  Ask people how you can make the pitch better or what would be more aligned with their audience  This doesn t work if you re blasting the world with spam messages  But if do your research  write personal emails  and still get no response  try sending a follow up and asking why not  You might be surprised at how generous people are with their thoughts   Ta da   With love   Andy  If you found this story valuable  I d love it if you gave it a share on Facebook or Twitter,"[868 289 1314 522 814 1360 936 561 1174 567 83]"

observe existing technology  design zeitgeist  and user needs aligning around leaner  more immediate  and human ways to engage with digital services   SMS is going through a renaissance  and designers are looking at this medium and interaction model to create new services and experiences  The immediacy and accessibility of SMS make it an ideal channel for building services in a world where systems continue to converge and apps are no longer the medium for digital experiences  As technology becomes more complex  users will need even more simplicity to engage with digital experiences   This article was originally published on Medium s IDEO Stories   Beyond the buzz  what conversational UI shows us is the idea that everything in design should be considered a conversation  All elements in an experience are exchanges in a conversation amongst people  a brand  a business  a service  and  increasingly  a machine powered intelligence  In this sense  conversation is the primary design material for designers and its general purpose is to impact or inspire people s behaviors and emotions   Designing conversations  Innovation is not rocket science  On the contrary  innovation begins simply by talking to real people  in real contexts  By putting ourselves in their shoes  we begin to truly understand their needs  motivations  and desires   Chatbots are exciting  but we re also excited about what they unlock for us as a learning medium  not just as the next big thing  While these days there s a strong focus on chatbots and using conversations as end products  in our IDEO New York studio  we ve been working for the past few years on using conversations as a prototyping tool to test assumptions  learn about a topic  and to inspire the design   Here  we share our experiences designing conversations to learn from real people  and to design real products   Stories of 3 chatbots  Below are 3 experiences prototyping with chatbots  to learn about user behaviors and mindset around health and fitness  to learn about culture and knowledge related to a health issue with local populations  and to test an early messaging platform to gain insights for the design of a messaging platform for social workers   Walkbot  Prototyping content and engagement  How might we better understand the nuances of what our participants need   In 2014  together with a Japanese electronics manufacturer  IDEO designed a device and smartphone app that captures a woman s activities throughout the day in order to generate thoughtful  actionable insights about her individual fitness choices  While we were working on this product  we had to tackle a brief that was quite broad  what are the unmet fitness needs of American women  between age 35 and 54    If I m going to interface with something that s recreational  I want it to be entertaining  I don t want it to hold me so accountable that I want to throw it against a wall    Anonymous user  To explore this opportunity  we crafted several prototyping sprints to better understand the needs of these women  At the time  the landscape of wearable devices was very heavily marketed towards men  data heavy  competitive  and physically unappealing for women  The women we were addressing wanted meaningful content  were far more focused on competing with themselves  and wanted something more discreet  Once we landed on a product  we took a step back to learn whether or not the product was meeting those needs  Turned out our product was also too data heavy    I like that it s there if I need it  It s kind of like a little friend    Anonymous user  We decided to pivot in order to uncover what meaningful content looks like for these women  Is it a conversation  Is it one directional  What type of tone or personality works best  What do they consider to be helpful or meaningful  Is content about being a sounding board or offering ways to push fitness   We wanted to test this out in real time without building the real thing  Our constraints were clear use only the information that we d normally get from an app s on boarding experience to craft parameters like gender  preferences around activities and metrics  and keep the mechanics simple so we could get to the meat of the problem and not get lost in the weeds   A software designer on the team built a custom tool leveraging Twilio s SMS API  and created an SMS platform that a team of people could use to manage and direct messages  The tool itself would send out messages from one source brand  We recruited a panel of women  and during their workouts  a team member would send messages such as  great workout  keep going  or  you ve walked _____ steps today  add a 5 minute walk to reach 10 000    Lisa   Ugh  he wants me to pick up my intensity and burn more calories    IDEO   How do you know it s a man    Lisa   Because I m mad at it right now    What was interesting about the prototype was uncovering unexpected learnings  Women who participated in the design research would project gender and personality to our bot based on their interactions with it  What participants assumed to be a pushy male coach as the bot was our IDEO female colleague sending messages in real time while walking side by side with the participants   The responses from our users were also far more nuanced than we expected  Women wanted to share not only their activities  but moments in which they failed or were simply being human  such as the times in which they caved and went ahead and ate a chocolate bar  Those moments mattered just as much for telling a holistic fitness story  In other moments  women assigned different genders to the bot depending on the response  In moments of frustration  the bot was referred to as a  he   To these women  fitness wasn t purely about achieving a goal  but also the process and dialogue in getting there   Considerations and learnings  Learn by doing  The best way to understand what a conversation needs to be is by starting the conversation  and figuring out tone of voice  pacing  and interactions as the dialogue unfolds   Conversations are about people  Making conversations feel more personal is possible with only a few data points  It implies being intentional and creative around what we know around the interlocutor  and progressively build and evolve from there   Bots are personas  whether or not it s intended  Every participant will project an identity of the bot  its gender and personality whether or not it has been created intentionally by the design team   Every participant will project an identity of the bot  its gender and personality whether or not it has been created intentionally by the design team  Be willing to pivot from happy accidents  Bots allow for a nuanced interaction that might bring surprising elements to your product  Be ready to shift  in case you uncover an unexpected direction that seem promising for your goals   Milton  Prototyping a service and product  How might we build a more effective service for connecting New Yorkers to public benefits and services   Milton was a bot we created to test out a text driven call center a kind of  integrated and everywhere  support meant to arm people with the knowledge they need to navigate the public benefit system  whenever they need it and wherever they are   The service would answer questions when possible  and direct clients to additional resources and other channels when appropriate  SMS felt like the obvious solution for the following reasons   It s immediate and accessible  It s responsive and meets people where they are  It can be automated and human  It s once removed  allowing for anonymity  It s asynchronous  which allows for graceful stops and easy exits  Its lower touch interactions can be more frequent  and more frequent means more data    The prototype  it was just a text message  It was an answer at my fingertips while I was cooking or while I was taking care of my kids    Anonymous user  Our team of 4 designers had limited knowledge in how to advise people going through the public benefit experience  so we hired two Single Stop case workers as advisors  created our custom bot  and set out on a 2 week texting experiment to simulate an SMS call center experience  We weren t sure what kinds of questions or cases we d receive  let alone what the expectations would be   Could we really support people remotely as they sought out a particular benefit or service  What should be the appropriate tone for people in crisis mode  Can we establish trust and rapport through a medium like SMS  And how easily is a problem resolved over text   The requirement for each of our participants was that they go through all of the steps necessary to apply for a benefit  and that they would text us their questions  concerns  and feelings throughout    I don t want to be treated that way    Anonymous user  During our 2 week prototype  we stayed connected to our participants and even managed to get one to successfully apply for a benefit  We learned that people have different modes for conversation  Some were looking for logistical answers in which case an automated impersonal response was fine  Others were looking for a sounding board and we discovered that a small  personable gesture of support can have a huge impact  And still others were trying to simply solve a problem and needed clear directives  We also learned the art of keeping the conversation open ended if you re intentional about  leaving the door open   people are more willing to come back  And finally  through our prototype  we learned the vital lesson that support is just as much about the right timing as it is about the right resources   Considerations and learnings  24 7 is not a requirement  You have a lot more permission than you realize and can design for that with automated responses that communicate hours  waiting time  and set expectations with users around your service   and can design for that with automated responses that communicate hours  waiting time  and set expectations with users around your service  Treat people like people  People are smart  sophisticated beings  Treat them with respect  responsibility  and honesty   People are smart  sophisticated beings  Treat them with respect  responsibility  and honesty  Talk like a real person  Design the SMS service like a real conversation simple things like starting the dialogue with a friendly  hello  and ending it with a proper goodbye  establish respectable boundaries  and have a clear follow up   Adapt for different modes of engagement  People have different modes for conversation and the service should adapt to that   Zikabot  Prototyping a service  How might we listen to and build empathy with the communities we want to help   In May 2016  IDEO embarked on a pro bono design sprint with a public health organization that was 90 days into the ongoing emergency response to the Zika virus in Puerto Rico  The organization needed a way to quickly evolve their hypotheses about engaging Puerto Ricans in protecting pregnant women from the virus   After an initial round of in person interviews revealed that many in Puerto Rico lacked accurate health information about Zika and were skeptical about the gravity of the virus  the team sought to prototype engagement channels that could increase awareness of the virus  potential impact on the population  One of those prototypes was Zikabot  a chatbot service for Puerto Ricans to ask anonymous questions about Zika and receive accurate health information in return  To advertise it  we plastered signs on the side of a car that was re branded as Zikamobile  and handed out about 150 cards in a mall  Users texted their questions to the Zikabot  while on the back end a team of subject matter experts and IDEOers answered as the bot  in certain cases debating internally on appropriate answers around the inquiries    From the point of view of the bot  which I played briefly this afternoon  I felt such responsibility in a way I hadn t felt when speaking to people  It was interesting  People can be very casual when texting  I worried about the nuances of how I worded my responses bad writing could put a person in danger    Anonymous user  The questions people texted confirmed the team s insight that many people in Puerto Rico lacked basic knowledge about the Zika virus  Furthermore  the team quickly learned that tone was vitally important  When some users expressed distrust in the formally worded responses they received  the team was able to immediately adjust their writing style to test a more conversational approach  Finally  it became apparent that the anonymity of the chatbot emboldened users to ask far more personal and revealing questions than were asked during the in person interviews   Why is the Zika virus in Puerto Rico    How is it possible that the same mosquito can spread three different viruses    Does Zika affect pets    I ve had a lot of intercourse lately what should I do    Overall  the Zikabot service proved a useful tool for the health organization to distribute accurate information about the virus in a resonant way  as well as to keep their finger on the pulse of a population from which they felt largely disconnected  However  uncovering the ways in which people might want to be spoken to in this kind of conversation was just as meaningful   More broadly  during our time on the ground  it became clear that when people were given all the facts about the virus  it dramatically changed how they viewed Zika and its impact on public health  Our team learned that these communities crave the why as well as the what  We found that agile  iterative  human centered design methods consistently won over the Puerto Ricans we met  and made them want to join the fight against the Zika virus   Considerations and learnings  Being accountable to real people means taking on real responsibility  This prototype had considerable implications in terms of ethics and impact  We had to put extra awareness and intention in making sure that the service was reliable  protected  and that the messages were truthful and validated scientifically   This prototype had considerable implications in terms of ethics and impact  We had to put extra awareness and intention in making sure that the service was reliable  protected  and that the messages were truthful and validated scientifically  SMS can be a safe space for tough topics  Have a clear objective  especially with sensitive topics   Chatbots to learn from people  and to design real products  During the past years the interaction design and design research teams at IDEO New York worked closely to find opportunities to engage with real people early on in the process to test value propositions and the desirability for digital products and services  As part of this collaboration  we built ad hoc tools that helped us designing conversations with users  and engage with them in real life contexts  to unlock empathy  and to individuate opportunities for the design process   In this article we covered the experiences we made through custom made SMS chatbots Milton  Walkbot  and Zikabot and we dove into our considerations and learnings for each one of those  With Milton we prototyped a communication service for social workers  With Walkbot we engage with women engaging with fitness to test language and messaging  Finally  with Zikabot we immersed ourselves and our partners in a local context to learn more about the level of preparedness and shared knowledge around the issue of Zika and its risks  This insight helped us iterate all messaging and content to a more accessible and straightforward language with the intention to demystify misconceptions and rumors regarding Zika   Although these 3 contexts are radically different from each other  for all of them we went though a set of principles that we followed when we planned and ran these chatbot based prototypes   Start with a question   A prototype is a question  embodied  What are you trying to learn  Who are you learning from  What s the ask of your users   Establish a set of parameters   Test your assumptions  It s not about getting it perfect and figured out  but setting up just enough to get the conversation going   Build an initial content library   When we say content  we mean  think about the tone  the types of content  when and how you exchange content  the frequency  Is it manual or automated   Hack existing tools   There s no need to build the real thing from the get go or reinvent the wheel   Iterate in real time   The beauty of SMS is that you can quickly adapt in real time to build on your learnings   Be mindful   Even though you re working on an early prototype  the interactions might occur with real people that might not be completely aware of your intentions  Be explicit about the context  and make sure that your actions are in line with the ethics of field research   Let go   Let the conversations evolve naturally  and be open to learn about the unexpected   Look back  look forward   Once you re done with your prototype  look back at the stories  anecdotes  and insights you gathered through your chatbot  to inspire the design of the service  content  or product   Meet Stanley  So at this point you might ask yourself this  How can I get started with my own chatbot to prototype and learn  There are 2 ways to get started   There are several services that can help you setting up an SMS based platform with little effort  Alternatively  you can create your own conversation bot following the instructions we shared for Stanley  the SMS based platform that we have been using for the stories we shared in this article   You can find the source code  and the instructions to setup Stanley here   For some more examples on projects using bots for design research  you can read an article on IDEO Labs by some of our friends and colleagues here   The Little Book of Design Research Ethics we made at IDEO aims to provide practical guidance for user research  The book is a guide on how to seek and share insights about people s lives in an ethical way   Thanks  To Amy Wang for the illustrations  to Anna Silverstein  Jackie Cooksey  Peter Olson for

880,training-dataset/product/925.txt,product,User personas  don t let them die   106 Flares 106 Flares    Could you deliver great software without user personas  Possibly  Especially if you are the user of your own system  Having easy access to users or customers is not the luxury of many of us however  In most cases  these people are remote and distributed across large areas or even time zones  Not knowing who the users are and what they need might lead to bad product decisions and even to the death of the product   We usually have a picture in mind of who the users are  but let s not forget that people who create the software see the world from a perspective of a quiet office  a desk with two or three desk monitors on it and a fast internet connection  How often is this the case for the users   In our case   never  Our users are delivery drivers  who are always on the move  using a mobile device in areas either too crowded or too remote to get a decent data connection  And it s definitely not quiet on the busy streets of London  This is why we have employed user personas   Done right  personas are extremely powerful  done wrong  they are a waste of everybody s time   There are many great publications about how to create personas  to name just a couple  The User is Always Right by Steve Mulder or The Persona Lifecycle by John Pruitt and Tamara Adlin  The persona recipe in a nutshell  Base the profiles on quantitative and qualitative research and focus on their goals  not demographics  Imaginary personas  not based on any research  carry low value and might even be risky until validated  So  get out of the building  GOOB   and talk to people  Talking to Humans by Giff Constable   Then check the numbers and come back to talking to people  And then create personas   Assuming you already have personas  the next challenge is to introduce them to your teams and then keep the profiles alive  Many personas die quickly because the dev team didn t believe in them or simply forgot to use them on daily basis   How to avoid this  It s worth including the whole dev team in the user research  If possible  every developer should spend some time with the users  Our starting point was working with delivery drivers for a day  That was an excellent experience and this is how empathy towards the users was born in the team  Refraining from introducing personas up to this point was a good move  because everyone could relate the profiles to the experience they had  Had I introduced Robert  Luke and Albert  the delivery driver personas  earlier  they wouldn t have seemed real  therefore the risk of ignoring or rejecting them would be higher   Once the team buys into personas  the next step is to make them visible  Distributing profiles via email might seem the most efficient  and environmentally friendly  solution  but that is not enough to keep personas alive  Developers get dozens of emails a day and information that is not continually on display is often forgotten  Posters around the office  especially on the walls around the team  or even better   on their physical agile board  where they meet daily  are a good idea  A thing to remember is that to get any attention  the profiles need to be visually engaging  Having pages of text on the display will be just a noise  Invest some time in making the information beautiful and easy to absorb and remember  An infographic is an excellent form of presenting this kind of information  Have a look here to learn more about infographics  http   www informationisbeautiful net   We went a step further  Robert  Luke and Albert are not just smiley faces watching us from the posters  Visualised in their full work uniforms on the posters  their miniatures are also present on every user story on the physical agile board  This makes us think about who is really going to benefit from the dev work  It is also a good indicator of how many user related stories we deliver compare to technical stories  which don t have any personas attached   We didn t stop just there  We do want personas to be realistic  so  we printed a persona named Alice to a life size format cut out  She is sitting in our office  wearing a real hi vis vest  like she normally would at work  She also comes to meetings  Her favourites are workshops and sprint demos  however  she can t always understand what the developers are talking about   Robert  Luke  Albert and Alice have their own email addresses and physical ID cards  so they can print their paperwork for the day   They get a lot of attention from passers by  That triggers conversations that wouldn t happen otherwise  They are alive   Personas are now present in everyday conversation and this has led to us changing our story format  We do not say  As a user I want  so that   any more  Neither Robert or Luke or Albert would ever say anything this way  In my opinion  artificial phrases make the story feel less real  hence less important  So  we started quoting the exact words the users would use  For example   Alice said   Is there any way we can adjust the notes section on this report  so it is bigger and fills the screen  This would aid us when putting in detail as often the information is too large and is hidden out of sight unless you click in and scroll through    I first realised that the team had fully adopted personas when I heard them discussing a feature request   This would never work for Luke  or  You think like a Robert    Another day someone declared that his shopping was delivered by  an Albert   Straight after that someone else came to me with   a solution for Albert s problem   which is now discussed in meetings mentioning Albert on the agenda   It really pays off to keep thinking about the users all the time  First of all  developers have found a sense of purpose   it s not  just a code   they are helping real people out there  Work that would be tagged  boring  before now has true meaning and therefore is more interesting  The delivery drivers are now happier  because they feel that we listen to them  and don t come up with the  useless IT ideas  any more   On top of all this  solving real problems as opposed to imaginary ones is a big win for the business,"[880 925 693 561 154 1054 1316 1362 878 552 1390]"
883,training-dataset/business/460.txt,business,12 Startup Lessons We Learned In Our First 12 Months12 Startup Lessons We Learned In Our First 12 Months  The first year is always the hardest   The first year of trying to get back into shape  The first year of learning a new language  The first year of getting out of a relationship   For us  it was the first year of launching our company  Rype  While this wasn t my first time starting a new business  I ve learned that it doesn t get any easier   You make same sacrifices of time away from loved ones  face internal doubts at 3am in the morning  and you burn the midnight oil with faith that what you re building will make an impact on the world   And it should be this hard  Because the rewards of building a startup are boundless  Everyday we get to hear from real people on the other side of the world who love using our product  work to build a vision that serves a purpose  and learn more in 12 months than we would have in five years   It s a never ending rollercoaster that brings with it ecstasy  pain  and fulfillment   often simultaneously  This is why we do our best bring you behind the curtains of our business to show you what it s really like  and the hard lessons we ve learned   Here s 12 startup lessons that we ve learned in our first 12 months   1  Question the status quo  One of my favorite questions to ask is   What if I did the opposite for X period of time   This question positions you to accomplish two things  1  ask if the traditional way of doing something is actually the best way  or if it s because it s always been done that way  2   X period of time  gives you an out  It allows you to test your theory without committing long term   When we first started  we had no idea that lessons  especially language lessons  could be innovated into a new model  If we didn t question the status quo  Rype wouldn t exist today   2  Let the small things slide  Things will go wrong when you re running a startup  Let me rephrase  almost everything will go wrong  But as long as you re standing on two feet  the sun will rise again  and you ll figure it out  In a world where your job is to put out fire after fire  you ve got to learn to let the small ones go so you can focus on the big ones   3  Don t try to be the popular kid in the block  Growing up  all any of us wanted was to be the popular kid in the block  The boy or girl that would make friends and be liked by everyone  We ve learned that the opposite applies in business  at least ours   When we started  we had to decide how we wanted to position ourselves in the market  From a pricing perspective  we knew that current market offerings were extremely expensive and over priced  making it difficult for people to learn a language  The alternative options were cheap tools that didn t provide quality value nor results to the end user   We wanted to be a high quality brand  without the heavy costs associated with it  By making this decision  we chose to isolate ourselves from those who wanted a free or cheap solution  and those that want to pay thousands of dollars for a fully immersive learning environment   Both are viable learning solutions  it s just not who we are   4  No one cares what you re selling  This is worth repeating  No one cares what you re selling  other than your loving mother of course  What everyone else in the world cares about is their own problems and how you can solve it for them   We made the mistake early on pitching the solution of what we were bringing to the market but no one listened  Then we shared why we created Rype  The beginnings of our journey  the vision behind the logo  and the ineffectiveness of current solutions  That s what got people fired up about what we had to offer   5  Complexity is the killer of businesses  and peace   Most things in our life and business are more complex than they need to be  There are layers and layers of complexity that we ourselves add because it s natural to assume that problems come with complex solutions   More often than not  we ve learned that this isn t true  If you force yourself to take a step back and see the bigger picture  the simplest solutions are usually the best solutions   6  Put yourself out of a job  When you ve put your heart and soul into something  it s easy to be caught up in doing everything yourself  This is what Michael E  Gerber  author of E Myth  famously calls working in your business when you should be working on your business   I still struggle with this sometimes  but scaling a business requires bringing in smarter and more competent people than you  and letting them execute  In other words  you re always trying to put yourself out of a job   7  How do I protect the downside   This is my favorite lesson from Richard Branson  As wild and adventurous as he seems  his most popular advice to entrepreneurs is to always protect the downside  An example is when Branson started Virgin Airlines  he structured a deal with Boeing so that if the business doesn t work out  he had the option to return all of the planes  This type of deal was unheard of in those days  and his total risk of capital was a few thousand dollars instead of millions   The question isn t meant to prevent you from taking blind risks  but to help you take calculated risks  The first one can put you out of business  while the latter may change your business forever   8  Stay in your lane  When Oprah was at the height of her career with her hit TV show  she would constantly remind her team to  run their own race   instead of focusing on what the competition was doing  When you re in a horse race and you re always looking back to the riders in the back  you ll fall behind via distraction  or give up if you re already behind   Our team is always reminded to stay in our own lane by keeping our focus on the customers  not the competition  The rest will come together   9  Let them fall on the grass  including you   Onboarding and training new team members is something we ve been working on optimizing  We re nowhere near perfect  but we ve learned that letting them fall gently on the grass is often better than being bogged down to micromanagement   Falling on the grass means making small mistakes that are quickly reversible with little impact to the company or customers  By leaving space for small mistakes  we have a more independent and empowered team that can take responsibility for their own work   10  Think subtraction  not addition  Adding more money  more resources  more features to a problem is rarely the solution  Money and resources are not exactly abundant when you re starting a company  but creativity and simplicity is   Doing less with more is a skill you re forced to develop  and we ve even made it as one of our core values at Rype  Another example is  instead of having a To Do List that never ends  it s just as useful to have a Not To Do List   11  Focus only on what you can control  It s as easy to get caught up in what you can change as what you can t change  The problem with the latter is  you have zero control over it  Bad things will always happen to us that are beyond our control  and getting frustrated or holding grudges is not going to make it disappear    The chief task in life is simply this  to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control  and which have to do with the choices I actually control    Epictetus  This is why we choose to spend less time on external factors  like what our competitors are doing  see Lesson  8   and more on internal factors  like how we can make satisfy our customers better   12  It doesn t get easier  It ll get easier when    We get to  XMM  revenue     We add X people to the team     We ve been in business for over X  years    Having spoken to many high performing entrepreneurs and investors who have built 9 to 10 figure businesses  it doesn t get easier   Adding X people means taking responsibility for managing X people   Being in business for 5 10 years means dealing with more competition  navigating through the economic turmoils  and constantly innovating the business  And adding  X revenue is just going to magnify the challenges mentioned above   It doesn t get any easier  Nor should it  Because the moment you feel like you re coasting is the moment you stop living to your full potential   The marathon has just begun  and this is mile number one,"[883 51 154 561 1316 1145 1390 667 362 684 482]"
893,training-dataset/business/974.txt,business,How to Run a Remote Design Sprint Without Going CrazyHow to Run a Remote Design Sprint Without Going Crazy  A few tricks for distributed teams  One of the most common questions about the GV sprint process is  How do you run a remote sprint  What if the team can t be together in one place    I ve heard stories of people running successful remote sprints  but to be honest  I never totally believed it  Part of the sprint magic is being in the same room   But this year  our team at GV was forced to run a few distributed sprints  and it actually worked  It s not ideal and it s not great  but it s definitely possible   I still don t have a perfect answer for how to make remote sprints work  But if you decide to try it  I have enough ideas to  hopefully  keep you from going crazy  Here goes   Tricks I ve tried that worked   Use Google Hangouts for video  I am totally biased toward Hangouts because I used to work on it long ago  But it really does work nicely for multi person video chat   I am totally biased toward Hangouts because I used to work on it long ago  But it really does work nicely for multi person video chat  Use Google Slides for Monday s whiteboard  or a Google Drawing   I am biased against Google Slides because I don t think it s very good for making presentations  But it does make a decent whiteboard  The collaborative features allow people in all locations to edit Monday s map  long term goal  and sprint questions   Maybe more important  everyone is equally disadvantaged  When you have a whiteboard in one location  it s great for the people there and lousy for everyone else  With Slides  everyone s looking at the same mediocre thing   This isn t from a real sprint  but you get the idea  How d I make the arrows point where I wanted them  Pro tip  Hold down the Command key when you drag points to override the  snap to  behavior  Works in Keynote too   If you can  buy a decent USB conference microphone for any room where there are multiple people  We ve used this one and it s pretty solid   for any room where there are multiple people  We ve used this one and it s pretty solid  Try multiple webcams in one room  If you have several people in one location  don t just have one computer dialed into the Hangout  Aim one web cam at the room  one web cam at the whiteboard  potentially even a third on the speaker   Obviously mute all the mics except one or it s gonna get real psychedelic real fast    If you have several people in one location  don t just have one computer dialed into the Hangout  Aim one web cam at the room  one web cam at the whiteboard  potentially even a third on the speaker   Obviously mute all the mics except one or it s gonna get real psychedelic real fast   Consider narrowing the sprint to one location on Wednesday and Thursday   just have the people in one location decide  map  and prototype  then bring the group back online to review the prototype  Thursday afternoon  and to watch the test  all day Friday  together  I know it sounds like a cop out  but Wednesday is especially tricky over video chat     just have the people in one location decide  map  and prototype  then bring the group back online to review the prototype  Thursday afternoon  and to watch the test  all day Friday  together  I know it sounds like a cop out  but Wednesday is especially tricky over video chat  On Friday  just debrief at the end of day  not between each customer interview  unless you have specific requests for the interviewer   Each location can take their own notes  come up with their own conclusions  and then talk over video chat at the end to compare  We ve done this a few times and it works well   syncing up with a call or video chat between every interview burns a lot of energy   Things I haven t tried that might work   Do How Might We notes separately  Let each location  even if it s just one person  come up with their own top 1

905,training-dataset/business/335.txt,business,How we cut our MVP in half to launch KIDLY   Simple   Human   MediumHow we cut our MVP in half to launch KIDLY  For the last 9 months  we at KIDLY have been designing and building a brand new online shop with the following tagline    The best stuff for baby  all in one place   Last week we launched silently to our many early adopters who we call VIPs  To do this we had to cut our original MVP in HALF   This has been a challenging process because our Chief James Hart  has a hugely ambitious and wonderful vision for KIDLY   a vision that has his team just as excited about the future as he is   If you consider that the  Original  MVP  defined over 6 months ago  was already a small slice of the vision  this meant that what was a 50  reduction to our MVP to us  probably felt more like a 75  reduction for James   To give you some context as to what this all means in real terms  I need to tell you about our  Original  MVP   Our  Original  MVP  Besides our teaser site  just to get pre launch sign ups   the Original MVP  defined around September 2015  consisted of designing and building a brand new responsive mobile first bespoke e commerce platform with the following feature set   Browse  Homepage  category page  sub category page  brand page  brand directory and product pages  Basket page  Each product list page had filters and pagination   Editorial  Article list page  article page  articles by tag whereby a tag related to a browse sections of the site and article pages would link to featured products i e  editorial is weaved into product and vice versa   Account  Managing your account  profile  child data  referral schemes  sign in  sign up  forgot password flows  returns flow etc   Checkout  Guest and logged in user flows  Capture  integration for typing addresses  More than one method for delivery  PayPal and standard card integration  using Stripe  and the other usual bits you find in checkout   Static pages  About  privacy policy  404  500  help and many more   Credit mechanism  This included users getting credit for completing their profile  referring friends   then redeeming against their order automatically   Parent test  Every single product was sent to a real parent for testing before being added to the site on every product page   And much more  things such as Zendesk and Intercom integration  Launching our own brand of KIDLY products  Custom photography for every single product  To start with 1000 products across 18 categories etc   Admin  All of the above was to be supported by a rich web application   this included the management of products  categories  brands  articles as well as integration with the warehouse and 2 courier companies   The original deadline  Our original launch date for this was pencilled in for February 2016 and we began working on the MVP in September 2015 with a tiny team of just 6 people   We didn t manage to launch in Feb   we didn t really get close to that  It s worth noting that this was an internal soft target to aim for   not hitting it was never going to be the  end of the world  etc   Regardless  I still want to discuss why I think we  failed  because that s where all of this gets interesting   Why we  failed    I put failed in quotation marks because it wasn t a critical failure as such  This is more of a  why we didn t get as much done as we might have  type thing  Here s why I think that was   1  The Original MVP was too big in the first place  Self explanatory really  When something is too big  it s just too big  The problem wasn t that it was too big  it was that it took us a while to come to terms with that   something I will explain shortly   2  We had a fixed deadline and a fixed scope   You can have either a fixed deadline or a fixed scope but not both   we inadvertently set ourselves up for failure   3  We zoomed in to details too early  What I mean by this is that every single piece of copy  every pixel and every micro interaction was scrutinised over and over  Ultimately it was near death by a thousand cuts   Nobody cares about your product as much as you do  Instead of designing overall flows  screens and states  we were spending sometimes weeks zooming in on these micro details  We were shooting for perfect when there is no perfect   Don t get me wrong  these details are important  things that our customers appreciated in the end  but when everything is a priority  nothing is   Also  when you have a huge array of features  a small team and are prone to zooming in like this  it results in failure  But fortunately failure often leads to success   What happened next   April was fast approaching and by this time we were getting itchy  We had cut a few minor items off the backlog but not enough to stop our t shirt sized estimate indicating a July launch date   something we wouldn t accept   You have to remember that we had thousands of VIPs  some of which vocalised their eagerness for us to launch  so they could spend their credit with us  It was difficult disappointing our VIPs   we even had to send them elsewhere to buy the products until our shop was ready   We had to do something   The best thing to happen to us  We could all feel some pain from many angles  We had been working on this for months and not seeing the fruits of our labour  We had our customers getting irritated because they wanted to buy stuff from us and of course we weren t making any money  We also didn t know if our product was any good as nobody had seen it  though we had a good idea it would be     We have to get this thing live in 4 weeks    James  James called us into a meeting and basically said  We have to get this thing live in 4 weeks   I don t care how we do it  it s important for KIDLY  it s important for our customers and it s important for morale     Having so much to do and so little time to do it  forced us into positive action   to prioritise   We knew this meeting was coming so we had come prepared to provide suggestions to this problem   When James said  Is everyone happy that we can do this in 4 weeks   everyone stayed silent   Then James turned to me and said  Adam     I will always wonder why he asked me      I said  the only way on earth that we can deliver this thing in 4 weeks is to launch behind closed doors i e  behind a login    I didn t think this would go down too well because of reasons already explained and also the fact that this would introduce friction for our users   the sort of friction that would normally have us striving so hard to eliminate from the experience   But it did   And then  the team kept firing even more suggestions at each other  We were all on board  all excited   I mean we were excited anyway  but now we had this plan and this deadline just around the corner  and we thought we would either do it  or get close to doing it  Each reduction complimented each other   We already  knew  that KIDLY was going to be great when we launched   this way it was just going to happen a whole lot quicker  We had now inadvertently set ourselves up for success   But  why did we launch behind a login   Our VIPs already had access to their account page  They could already login  complete their profile  and refer friends   it s just they couldn t shop yet   Ensuring that users had to be logged in to view the shop had 3 huge benefits   It drastically reduced the complexity of the site as we only needed to cater for logged in states  This meant that we could remove guest checkout from the backlog  We didn t have to worry about SEO and social sharing  and of course it reduced the amount of development  We could launch just to our VIPs which would also bring an aire of exclusivity to the experience   they are VIPs after all  Launching to VIPs only  meant that we reduced the risk and enabled us to receive vital feedback before opening up to public   What else did we suggest   Here s the other big things we suggested   1  We halved the amount of products  Instead of launching with 1000 products we decided it would be okay to launch with less than half of that  This itself had two far reaching benefits   First  we halved the effort required to produce and upload content  This includes copywriting  photography  uploading product information and of course testing each and every product  And of course ensuring that we had enough stock for each of those products   Second  we could significantly reduce the complexity of the site  For example we no longer needed sub categories   there was going to be less than 40 products on each category page  so why offer people the ability to drill down  In a similar vein  we no longer needed filtering or pagination   2  We removed brand pages  Brand pages are a nice to have feature but we still took the option to cut these out  In doing so we removed  super  brand   simple  brand and brand directory pages  This also meant that our navigation was simplified   customers could only shop by category  Easy   3  No PayPal  This was a big decision for us as we know how important PayPal is to increasing conversion in checkout  We already had to integrate Stripe and just didn t have the capacity for this  It s high up on the post launch backlog though   We succeeded   We didn t quite manage to launch in the 4 weeks we were given  but we got very close indeed   In the end we launched in 5 weeks  and even that was down to a third party courier not being able to test returns labels in time for us to start shipping   It must be said that James and the team achieved what felt impossible to achieve  It has been very enjoyable working with the team  especially in the last 4 weeks as I have witnessed the progression of this success   What our customers say   We have had some wonderful feedback from our many VIPs  Here is just some of that feedback    Love the site  really easy to navigate and ordering was a doddle  my face normally sinks if PayPal isn t involved but checkout was so quick     So so pleased with the speed of delivery  honestly didn t expect them to arrive so quickly  So far so good on the website  I love the layout  the clean lines  and ease of use     Awesome imagery  love the list of products with the big photos and the Ideas section  And many products look gorgeous    What about the results   We have had a good sales rates  can t disclose numbers  and a phenomenally successful conversion from basket at 26    This is still early days and these stats are based on low numbers overall  but early signs are great  Especially considering that we haven t even told all of our VIPs that we re open yet   we staggered the announcement  again to reduce risk   What did we learn   Here are all the things we learnt from this experience   1  Everyones idea of MVP is different  James  idea of MVP and my idea of MVP are quite different  We have often disagreed on macro and micro aspects of the product but that s to be expected not only because we are different people but because we are bound to see KIDLY from different perspectives   James is running an entire company and bringing every piece of the puzzle together  He has to consider the overall vision at all times during every small and large decision   Couple that with the aim to provide a level of service to rival Amazon and you start to understand reducing various parts of an MVP might be difficult at the best of times   For me  it s more about getting this thing live and in front of our customers as soon as possible because the real feedback on product design starts then  So I was more trigger happy to kill off features   But ultimately  what is right for KIDLY is somewhere in between  There is no  right  or  wrong  MVP   you just have to get your team on the same page and as soon as possible   2  That  Good enough  is good enough  During the first few months at KIDLY James gave us Rework by Jason Fried  to read  In it there is a chapter explaining the concept of  Good Enough    If you can accept early on that perfect doesn t exist  you can get the macro things done earlier  This in turn is good for momentum and morale because as a team you feel like your moving forwards at a positive rate  Without momentum you can lose motivation   If you avoid details early on then you get to have a rough copy of your product holistically  This is beneficial because a product is normally experienced as a whole not in piecemeal   If it feels wrong holistically you can rectify without destroying the detail  If it feels right you can go ahead and dive into the detail  Win Win   3  Bite off half of what you think you can chew  Whatever it is you think you are capable of achieving  stop and remove 50  of it right there and then  Get rid of the other half until the first half is complete  Obviously  half  is a horizontal slice as opposed to a vertical slice   4  Give your teams problems to solve  not solutions to adopt   When it came to crunch time  James gave us a difficult problem and empowered us to make it work  There is nothing like challenge  accountability and trust to unite a team  in order to set yourself up for success  James showed great leadership which lead us to success quickly   5  It s either a fixed deadline or a fixed scope  not both   There is nothing more to say here   6  Pressure forces you to think creatively  Pressure can ignite an individual or a team to think differently  and accept the  what might have previously been deemed  unacceptable   I never thought we could launch in 4 weeks and I didn t think we would go for such a tiny version of our Original MVP  But we managed both of those things   7  A lack of features can be a very good thing  If you go by just the feedback  sales and conversion so far  it would be easy to think that the product is great as it is   that s because it is great as it is   even with half an MVP  It just goes to show that less is often better   What s next for KIDLY   To be expected after launch  we have been fixing bugs and improving UX but now we re starting the next big phase of KIDLY   opening up the shop to the public   We will be taking everything we have learnt with us  continuing to make parents lives easier  by bringing you the best stuff for your baby all in one place   To quote James again  this is just the beginning   watch this space   If you enjoyed this please hit the   below  I would appreciate that a lot   Don t want to miss an article  Get my articles by email,"[905 154 125 1349 561 1316 782 51

Charlie Parker  Miles Davis  and Duke Jordan   Photograph by William P  Gottlieb  Library of Congress  Washington  DC  1947    It s February 13  1960  and Ella Fitzgerald stands on a West Berlin stage  nearing the end of a stellar performance  On a whim  she decides to sing  Mack the Knife   a popular song  but one she s never performed live  The first chorus goes as planned  and then  she blanks and completely forgets the lyrics to the next verse  What do you do in her situation   choke up  end the song abruptly  or maybe just repeat the first chorus  Not the legendary Ella Fitzgerald  Instead  she begins to improvise   ELLA FITZGERALD   Oh  what s the next chorus   To this song  now   This is the one  now  I don t know   And now Ella  Ella  And her fellas  We re making a wreck   What a wreck  Of  Mack the Knife    Her band followed her lead and played along  never missing a beat  improvising along with her as she scats  impersonates Louis Armstrong  and begs the audience s forgiveness in perfectly constructed verses  When the song ends the applause is so loud the audience must have exploded from their seats  Ella s on stage improvisation would earn her two Grammy Awards  That s jazz  untidy  unpredictable  and utterly fantastic   In the book Yes To The Mess  Surprising Leadership Lessons from Jazz  Frank Barrett   a management professor and accomplished jazz pianist   proves there is much product managers can learn from the way these musicians approach their craft  Jazz is messy  The musicians invent as they play  improvising with only the loosest of structure  and letting the music steer them  The performers don t use sheet music  Prominent jazz artists  like Ella  flirt with disaster  night after night  Always improvising  they don t know what they ll end up with when they start  It s uncomfortable  Sound familiar   Ella Fitzgerald  Dizzy Gillespie looks on    Photograph by William P  Gottlieb  Library of Congress  Washington  DC  1947    There is probably no better example than the best selling jazz album of all time  Miles Davis s Kind of Blue  Released in 1959  it still sells more than 5 000 copies a week  Even if you don t know anything about jazz  you might recognize these tunes  Miles brought together a group of musicians at the top of their games   tenor saxophonist John Coltrane  alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley  pianists Bill Evans and Wynton Kelly  on different songs   bassist Paul Chambers  drummer Jimmy Cobb  and  of course  Miles Davis on his trumpet   The entire album was recorded in two concise sessions   a total of just nine hours in the studio  That s about one workday  To our good fortune  Columbia Records kept the original three track tapes  allowing us to listen to the album taking shape  They capture the studio chatter  the coughing  the teasing  and the false starts  In this take from the song  So What   drummer Jimmy Cobb flubbed a transition  He hit his cymbal too high up and too hard  and the crash is conspicuous   As soon as he did it  Cobb knew he d goofed  Such a dramatic crash might have kicked off fast paced  hard driving bebop solos  but Miles didn t want to make a bebop album  Yet Cobb s mistake was understandable   the musicians never played these songs together before  they hadn t rehearsed  and they had little idea what they were going to play when they arrived at the studio   When they walked in  Miles handed the players slips of paper with only rough patterns and an overarching framework   a few chords  but mostly scales  Think of it as a rough spec  a PM mockup equivalent  To complicate matters  Miles wanted to break into a brand new direction   what would be called modal jazz  where less is more   so the patterns seemed foreign   Let s listen in again  The producer  Irving Townsend  is in the recording booth  He stops the song because he s picking up some unwanted background noise  We hear him speaking over the PA system   IRVING TOWNSEND   Watch the snare too  we re pickin  up  some of the vibrations on it   MILES DAVIS   Well that goes with it   TOWNSEND   What   DAVIS   All that goes with it   TOWNSEND   All right   laughter   Irving Townsend sounds a little uncomfortable  and that was Miles s intention  From the studio tapes we can tell that Miles wants the chaos  He wants the mess  He s probing for discontentment and unpredictability  By pushing his ensemble into an unfamiliar zone  they re more likely to create something meaningful  An average jazz performer would take the comfortable route and tighten up the background noise  but Miles wanted to send a message to the group  All that goes with it   In a terrific talk where they both perform and speak  Jeff Gothelf and Jim Kalbach compared agile product teams to a jazz band  They observed three important features in common   Patterns  each session starts with a rough blueprint  a set of loose patterns serve as guide rails  Kind of like a sprint  You can t play good jazz from nothing   each session starts with a rough blueprint  a set of loose patterns serve as guide rails  Kind of like a sprint  You can t play good jazz from nothing  Empathy  jazz musicians use the term  Big Ears   A performer is said to have Big Ears when they pick up on what the others are doing  anticipate  and create  Constant receptivity and active listening based on an emotional connection with their instruments and the others   jazz musicians use the term  Big Ears   A performer is said to have Big Ears when they pick up on what the others are doing  anticipate  and create  Constant receptivity and active listening based on an emotional connection with their instruments and the others  Uncertainty  embracing uncertainty doesn t mean playing whatever you want  The patterns are there to guide them  But it does mean that when you climb in the car  you don t know exactly where you might end up   Now that we understand how Miles guided the session  let s return to Jimmy Cobb s cymbal crash  Remember  Cobb assumed Miles would need to stop the take and start from the top again  Let s listen to how Miles reacts   Miles Davis didn t stop the recording  Instead  he launched into one of the greatest trumpet solos in history  The resonating cymbal seems everlasting  giving life to the trumpet and floating along  The crash made the solo even more exceptional  When we first heard the crash  it sounded like a mistake  But when Miles played the next notes  it became something else  something new  There would be no second take   this is what s on the album  Cobb later said   It must have been made in heaven    Always work hard on something uncomfortably exciting   Larry Page  Miles said   If you re not making a mistake  it s a mistake   In the words of jazz vibraphonist Stefon Harris   There are no mistakes in jazz  every mistake is just a missed opportunity   An ordinary leader would stop the tape and start over  trying for perfection  They would seek to avoid discomfort and stick to the plan  It took a tremendous leader like Miles to recognize the moment  take the risk  and create something glorious  Turning a mistake into an opportunity  Barrett calls this form of leadership  provocative competence   where  the goal is the opposite of conformity  a leader s job is to create the discrepancy and dissonance that trigger people to move away from habitual positions and repetitive patterns    How many of you think of your job  as a PM  is  creating dissonance   Making innovative products requires the same ability to surrender to the unknown  to follow the music wherever that goes   If you want to see an excellent example of provocative competence in product leadership  read this letter that Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield sent to his team before they launched    Our third example comes from Duke Ellington  another master of provocative competence  In Barrett s book  the trumpeter Clark Terry recalled a story about Ellington  where Terry is struggling to find the right tone during a session   One day  Ellington asked him to play like the trumpeter Buddy Bolden   I said   Maestro  I don t know who the hell Buddy Bolden is   Duke said   Oh sure  you know Buddy Bolden  Buddy Bolden was suave  handsome  and a debonair cat  Aw  he was so fantastic  He was fabulous  He was always sought after  He had the biggest  fattest trumpet sound in town  He bent notes to the nth degree  He used to tune up in New Orleans and break glasses in Algiers    As a matter of fact  you are Buddy Bolden   Ellington is nudging Terry to go somewhere unexpected  somewhere uncomfortable  As Barrett notes  provocative competence is affirmative   Duke believes in Terry  more than Terry believes in himself  He was talking about Terry all along  We know we aren t our best when we re frazzled  but research shows that we also perform badly when we re too cozy  The ideal performance level is in the sweet spot  It s called  optimal anxiety  and was first recognized in 1908  The concept applies to everything from physical fitness to habit formation  This is what Google s Larry Page calls being  uncomfortably excited    Miles  Ella  and Duke were adept at guiding their bands into the optimal anxiety zone  making them restless and opening up a space where they could create masterpieces  Such talent is also needed in product management  So much of what we ve learned  our instincts  are to do the complete opposite  We re told to minimize risk  communicate a clear plan  and document every step  As product managers  our most important job is to help our teams find the place of optimal discomfort   the goldilocks zone of ambiguity and uncertainty   Google researchers undertook a massive multi year research project to understand the effectiveness of teams  They wanted to know why certain teams at Google performed highly and others did not  Was it the size of the team  The blend of personality types  Or even their physical environments  Over time it became clear that who was on the team didn t matter so much as how the team operated  More specifically  the social norms that determined whether or not everyone got a voice  and whether or not the team members felt that if they made a mistake  they knew it could be openly discussed without fear of embarrassment  Incredibly  group traits like  conversational turn taking  and  sensitivity to nonverbal cues  matters more than the intelligence or experience of the team members  That s encouraging news for those of us who don t get to perform with John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley   If you re not making a mistake  it s a mistake   Miles Davis  There s a term for this  psychological safety  The researcher Amy Edmondson demonstrated that teams can appear to be strong on the surface  people like and respect each other  and they get along well  Despite that  they may have an environment where everyone sits silently while the boss talks at them  or where people feel ashamed to be vulnerable and open up about their fears  They might all love hanging out together after work  but nobody can bring themselves to tell someone when they ve got toilet paper stuck to their shoes  If we want a climate where people can accomplish groundbreaking things  we need to know our voice will be heard and where we re not afraid to take risks   The best jazz bands  like the best Google teams  provide the space to take risks  We already know jazz artists have hyperaware senses and can pick up on nonverbal clues  But everyone also gets a voice  In jazz  it s assumed that unexpected contributions can come from anyone  Getting a  voice  also means every band member takes a turn soloing  Each player spends time as both leader and follower  Miles was always attune to the contributions of everyone  If he realized someone hadn t had a solo in a while  he d lean over to them and whisper in his gravelly voice that they should take the lead   Followership in jazz is worthy of the highest respect   it s known as comping  Comping is listening and responding without overshadowing  Followership needs to be active  not passive  It s not about sitting back and letting someone else do all the work  You take an indispensable role in giving space  riffing  experimenting  and supporting  And yet leading and talking are more valued than following and listening in our work culture    Note that psychological safety doesn t always mean the leader is a joy to work with  Miles Davis could carry a grudge for decades  He was addicted to heroin and cocaine  and was abusive  Yet he was a genius at cultivating creative environments where everyone had a voice  Of course  this doesn t mean you should be a jerk  It just means that being nice isn t enough    Duke Ellington   Photograph by William P  Gottlieb  Library of Congress  Washington  DC  1946    What can you bring back to your job as a product manager  Here are three things to remember   1 Get uncomfortable  Miles Davis nudged his musicians into a place where they were uncomfortable  the zone of optimal anxiety  What Larry Page calls  uncomfortably exciting   When Duke Ellington challenged Clark Terry to play like Buddy Bolden  When Ella Fitzgerald thought   uh oh   What Frank Barrett calls provocative competence  triggering people away from habit and repetition  Where there are no such things as mistakes  only missed opportunities  Embracing uncertainty when we make software  which is inherently unpredictable  We don t know how our users  or our audience  will react  and that goes with it   2 Listen carefully  jazz is a continual conversation where listening is more important than talking  Big Ears encourage empathy  knowing where others are going  and helping them get there  Looking for mistakes that can become new opportunities  You can help by listening more than talking  by being willing to ask questions when you don t know the answers  even when you think you do  Celebrate following and listening in addition to leading and talking   3 Let everyone solo  in jazz  everyone takes turns both leading and following  Psychological safety means everyone knows their voice is valued  and that they re not afraid to try something risky  You can create this for your teams by demonstrating engagement  making sure each person speaks and is heard  picking up on unspoken emotions  and showing your understanding   When I walk on stage  I always enjoy a little stage fright   Duke Ellington  I hope you ll go out and listen to Kind of Blue  preferably on vinyl  I also hope you ll seek discomfort  to look for ways to push yourselves and your teams into the uncharted  Be psychologically safe  but out of your comfort zone  Where you re uncomfortably excited  Where

919,training-dataset/product/586.txt,product,Creativity  Inc  Developing a Culture of Creativity Within an OrganizationMany of us have a romantic idea about how creativity happens  A lone visionary conceives of a film or a product in a flash of insight  Then that visionary leads a team of people through hardship to finally deliver on that great promise  The truth is  this isn t my experience at all  I ve known many people I consider to be creative geniuses  and not just at Pixar and Disney  yet I can t remember a single one who could articulate exactly what this vision was that they were striving for when they started   In my experience  creative people discover and realize their visions over time and through dedicated  protracted struggle  In that way  creativity is more like a marathon than a sprint  You have to pace yourself   Too many of us think of ideas as being singular  as if they float in the ether  fully formed and independent of the people who wrestle with them  Ideas  though  are not singular  They are forged through tens of thousands of decisions  often made by dozens of people  To reiterate  it is the focus on people   their work habits  their talents  their values   that is absolutely central to any creative venture   Failure isn t a necessary evil  In fact  it isn t evil at all  It is a necessary consequence of doing something new    If I start on a film and right away know the structure   where it s going  the plot   I don t trust it   Pete says   I feel like the only reason we re able to find some of these unique ideas  characters  and story twists is through discovery  And  by definition   discovery  means you don t know the answer when you start   This is key  When experimentation is seen as necessary and productive  not as a frustrating waste of time  people will enjoy their work   even when it is confounding them   There are two key differences  as I see it  The  rst is that the Braintrust is made up of people with a deep understanding of storytelling  who usually have been through the process themselves  While the directors welcome critiques from many sources  they particularly prize feedback from fellow storytellers  The second difference is that the Braintrust has no authority  The director does not have to follow any of the speci c suggestions  After a Braintrust meeting  it is up to him or her to  gure out how to address the feedback  Giving the Braintrust no power to mandate solutions affects the dynamics of the group in ways I believe are essential   Frank talk  spirited debate  laughter  and love  If I could distill a Braintrust meeting down to its most essential ingredients  those four things would surely be among them   The  lm not the  lmmaker is under the microscope  This principle eludes most people  but it is critical  You are not your idea  and if you identify too closely with your ideas  you will take offense when challenged   Research trips challenge our perceived notions and keep cliches at bay  They fuel inspiration  They are  I believe  what keeps us creating rather than copying   Here s a curious thing about research  The authenticity it fosters in the film always comes through  even if moviegoers know nothing about the reality the film is depicting  Very few moviegoers have actually been inside the kitchen of a high end French restaurant  for example  so you might think the obsessive specificity of Ratatouille s kitchen scenes   the chefs  clogs clacking on the black and white tile floors  the way they hold their arms when they cut up vegetables  or how they organize their work spaces   would be lost on the audience  But what we ve found is that when we are accurate  the audiences can tell  It just feels right   Does this kind of microdetail matter  I believe it does  There s something about knowing your subject and your setting inside and out   a confidence   that seeps into every frame of your film   If you give a good idea to a mediocre team  they will screw it up  If you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team  they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something better   The takeaway here is worth repeating  Getting the team right is the necessary precursor to getting the ideas right  It is easy to say you want talented people  and you do  but the way those people interact with one another is the real key  Even the smartest people can form an ineffective team if they are mismatched  That means it is better to focus on how a team is performing  not on the talents of the individuals within it  A good team is made up of people who complement each other  There is an important principle here that may seem obvious  yet   in my experience   is not obvious at all  Getting the right people and the right chemistry is more important than getting the right idea   I just finished reading Creativity  Inc    by far the best book I ve read on developing a culture of creativity within an organization  Written by Ed Catmull   co founder and president of Pixar Animation and eventually Disney Animation  it takes us through the earliest days of Pixar  and most importantly  into the actual creation process of some of the most creative films Pixar ever made  including Toy Story  Wall E  Up  Monsters  Inc  and more Ed dispels our romantic notions of what creativity is all about and instead replaces it with actionable insights on how any organization  with incredible dedication to culture and process  can create a far more creative organization  I wanted to share 5 key take aways I had from Creativity  Inc   illustrated through quotes directly from the book I could speak at length to the lessons I gleaned from Creativity  Inc   but I couldn t do so as eloquently as Ed Catmull did himself  So I encourage you to take the time to read it for yourself if boosting your organization s creativity is important to you  Creativity  Inc by Ed Catmull,"[919 589 649 1316 561 1025 799 51 863 154 84]"
925,training-dataset/product/396.txt,product,Want to Get The Most Out of User Interviews  Read This   Want to Get The Most Out of User Interviews  Read This     6 tactics to help you uncover what users really want   People don t do what they say they do  People don t do what we think they do  People don t do what they think they do   It s pretty tough to know your target users  needs  it s a known fact  It is tougher if you have no prior experience of talking to users  First of all  users don t know what they want  Henry Ford still gets credit for something he might not have actually said   Secondly  it would be a cliche to state how important it is to listen to your customer s  Here are few tactics we use to help identify your customers  pains and needs  This isn t surely an exhaustive list  but can act as a good starting point   Running a successful interview is less about following specific rules  It is about being a certain kind of a person for the duration of the interview   Do Not Ask Yes No Questions   The beginning of a user interview is the toughest part  Let s say you want to build an appointment management app  After breaking the ice with a PA of a Fortune 500 company  CEO  you are about to start the process  The worst thing you can do is ask a Yes No question like this  Do you have a strategy to start the day   What possible answers can you get from this question  Either affirmation   Ya  I always have a strategy  Or negation   Not particularly   It is a response nonetheless  But it has now become more like an interrogation and less like a conversation  The idea is to help the user open up   What happens if it flows like this  At the start of the day  do you check urgent messages first  no matter where they are from   Actually  things from my boss are more important  because they are for me to do  Messages or faxes may be for anybody   The question is based on an assumption you have  You are just reframing the question is a different way which begs for more than a  yes  or  no  answer   You ve just introduced a scenario  and the user talks about specific details  The conversation has begun  Finally   Note  In other cases  a similar kind of question  when asked in a void  can be hard to process   How do you find Tumblr   The answers might be  pretty good  not bad  That is not enough  To actually get a good response  we have to stack it up with similar apps like Medium  Wordpress  etc  Then you can ask users to rank the apps according to their preference   Then you can follow up with further questions like  why one is better than the other  Or  what is the defining factor for your decision   Do Not Ask Leading Questions   Do not confuse a non yes no questions with a leading question   A leading question means that you have already assumed a few things about the user  Hence  it influences her answer   Leading Question is the kind that encourages a particular answer  It is often because of the way the question is phrased  It contains hints and excludes many other possible answers   Leading Question   How angry do you usually feel when there is network failure in the middle of an important business call   The example above is leading  It focuses the respondent s mind to a single emotion i e  anger  It also makes it unlikely that he she will talk about other emotions  like anxiety  or shock   The purpose of conducting an interview is to get real  truthful answers to questions  Asking leading questions defeat that purpose   Non leading Question   Recall a time when the line call dropped in the middle of an important business conference  How did you feel   Unlike the first example  this non leading question opens up a whole range of emotions  This time  the question didn t assume that the interviewee was angry   It is important to note that the question still frames the user to think of only certain kinds of emotions  She only thinks about the emotions she associates with failed conference calls   Even More Non leading Question   Recall a time when the line call dropped in the middle of an important business conference  What did you think or feel   Now  the question isn t restricted only to emotions  but also includes the respondent s thoughts  You should probe about their emotions if they focus too much on their thoughts  and vice versa  This way you can get both aspects of the answer   All in all  it s easy to ask leading questions  but also easy to avoid them  It takes just a little more thought   Spot Lies   Let s take another example  You are building a personalised workout app and you want to know how often people hit the gym   If you ask   How often do you hit the gym in a week   The answer might be  regularly or pretty often  Activities like going to the gym  going out for jogging  need a lot of effort  A user would seldom prefer to admit her inefficiency   It is equally possible that they have no idea about their inefficiency  According to them  they had to miss the last few appointments because of work at the office   In this situations  If you follow up with another question   When were the last two times you went to the gym   You are more likely to get the truth  Of course  you should not ask it like an investigator  It is more about learning their behaviour  If there are loopholes in the story  probe gently to clarify doubts   Give a Heads Up   It is advisable not to interview users without prior notice  You would get honest answers  but that might not be helpful to you   They might only focus on a most recent pain and not even mention about an ongoing inconvenience  They might have gotten accustomed to it  or they might have found a workaround  But it is still an inconvenience nonetheless   People are ingenious at adapting to inconvenient situations  They are often not even aware that they are doing so   If you give them a day or two to think about a problem before talking to them  you ll get a variety of answers  This will include the recent pain along with a more important pain  The latter might even be of higher priority   After your first interview  you may ask the user to maintain a journal to track their experiences  If you are tracking an office goer s fitness regime  ask him to note down incidents when he had to cancel the gym  Journals act as gems when you are developing ideas  They help you immensely in building the user journey   Diversify Your Target Group   Having one on one with many people is always advisable  But having a one on one with a variety of people would give you a broader perspective  Let s say  your target users are good sellers  If you talk to a general seller  a wholesaler  and a black market seller  it will give you varied insights   It is tough to hangout with black market seller or a thief  but I hope I ve made my point   It is important to mention that solving a major problem is more important than solving what is easy  For that  you have to be willing to get away from the peak of the bell curve and go towards the extremes   Finding the problems in the extremes will give you an edge  even though a large group of people might not face that problem  Remember  it is better to make a few people happy than making a lot of people feel just OK   Find The Root   It is observed in a lot of cases that there are various manifestations of a root problem  If you are depressed  you might do poorly at work  fail to enjoy most things and might have health issues  These are different outcomes because of depression  Why are you depressed  A death in the family  A recent breakup probably   It is usually tough to find the root of the problem  Implying 5 Whys might help  Addressing the root of the problem also addresses the rest of the manifestations   After you have researched and have brainstormed ideas  you enter the prototyping phase  Then  it is a good practice to go back to your users with a prototype  You ll be able to see if their need has been translated into the product  A simple sketch of an app  a skit or mock video of a service  a crude thermocol mockup of a product would be enough to convey your idea   User feedback is bad at telling you what you should be building  What it s good at is telling you where you fucked up   Keeping your interviewed users in the development loop is important  These early prototyping feedbacks save you a lot of problems in the future  Basically  it tells you where you ve fucked it up  It is a way of getting idea validation and is a step towards finding product market fit   Keep in Mind These Few Points   Don t Be Stubborn   Being stubborn with your early assumptions can make the interview process biased  You ll most probably just reconfirm what you already knew  Confirmation bias doesn t help in any way   Don t talk too much  Let the user take the lead  Be a good listener and respond to the user  If the conversation gets swayed away in a different direction  gently probe   Avoid pitching to your users  You aren t here to influence them  You are an apprentice and you want to learn as much as possible in the given time  Ask if you have doubts  and would like to confirm a few things   Be Prepared   It is usually advisable to make a list of the questions you plan to ask  Other questions will arise organically during the interview  Define the main question  For e g    How do you remain productive throughout the day   The supporting questions can be derived from the main question   Do you plan your day in advance  Do you maintain a to do list  Do you use an app for that or do you use paper sticky note  Why do you think an app paper is better than the other  How do you prioritise the tasks based on duration  emergency etc  How many items do you usually have in a given day   Try to Make The Process Interesting   Sometimes you might feel that you are interfering in the daily lives of your users  It is common to feel that way  One way to make the process interesting and delightful is to introduce gamification   Let s take an example again  You are trying to find out how aged couples buy and arrange their household items  Instead of just talking to them  you can draw a cupboard  dishwasher  food processor  bookshelf on post its  Along with that  you can doodle items like books  lamp  and showpieces that will sit on furnitures   Then you can hand them the colourfully doodled post it notes to organise their home  You can ask them to start with the most valuable items first  You can also introduce different scenarios  For e g   in a given situation are they likely to buy a refrigerator or a washing machine   It is a small task and is pretty easy to put in place  but makes the process a lot more interesting  The user feels immersed in the whole process of setting up their home   Note  It is not at all a full fledged process  These are few pointers to get you going  There are lots of users who are not comfortable opening up to others  There is not much we can do about it  But there are other users who are willing to talk  but need some probing to get comfortable with you  Then there s the third kind who are pretty open and vocal about their thoughts  The last two kinds are your ideal users,"[925 154 1327 561 684 1248 1316 693 878 799 863]"

931,training-dataset/product/353.txt,product,How to send good email   opens  clicks  conversionsA badly written email is about as effective as a love letter addressed  To whom it may concern   Don t waste your time writing them  There are some basics to writing emails  some simple rules that you can follow to maximize the chances that your email will be opened  clicked  and ultimately convert  The basics of email open rates  A good email open rate is regarded as anything above 20   depending on your content  Open rate is a crapshoot at best  It relies on a mail client preloading a single pixel gif  which varies depending on everything from the mail client  to whether you re in the address  to the browser Gmail is loaded in  With most modern email clients giving a generous preview  it often means that an email can be read without being  opened   regardless of how you even track opens  Like I said  a crapshoot   You can achieve a good open rate at any list size  If anything  the larger your list grows  the more likely it is that people are opening  unless you re scamming people into subscribing  So  in this regard  if your open rate takes a nosedive it should be cause for concern  and not simply something that happens as you expand  Readers slip away over time  However  reader fatigue  like activity churn  is a reality of growing a list of subscribers  Someone who hung on your every word six months ago might feel  24 emails later  that you re repetitive  or losing touch  The email marketer s equivalent of the sophomore slump  There is no easy way to combat this  the tactic is  Stay Relevant   but there s no quick hack for that  no matter how often people try  Some tactics will improve your open rate  Subject line and  from  fields are your best weapons here  Hillary Clinton s campaign team have achieved excellent results with simple and personal subject lines such as  I d love to meet you    What did you think of last night s debate    and one of the most successful   Dinner    Other quick hacks include things like interesting characters in the subject line  changing sender for emails to break from monotony  or tweaking time of sending  But remember  over time all marketing strategies result in shitty click through rates  at first they work  then they don t  Understanding email click through rates  Along with reader fatigue  there is also click fatigue to consider  Whilst email click through rates are infinitely more accurate than open rates  there is no universally acceptable rate  as there are too many ways to link  There are  thankfully  good guidelines  Firstly  your first and second links account for the vast majority of your clicks  The obvious conclusion of this is that you never bury your call to action as the 7th link down the page  So don t bury your links  The exception here is newsletters or digest emails  where the links are clicked evenly  and they are all the exact same call to action i e  go here  read this  Secondly  a digest style  with predictable link locations  has a far higher click through rate than scattering links inline  Email format matters  Make the links in your email obvious Thirdly  a common cause of poor click through rates are non obvious links  As shown below  a weak style on a link halves its click through rate  So make sure your links are obvious and favour clarity over beauty  Your job is to get clicks  not become a master of subtlety   How to get them to click,"[931 814 936 117 1063 83 868 1279 649 723 511]"

re below the 2   as Campaign Monitor recommends   you re doing something right   Mailchimp  in their research   found the average unsubscribe rate can be as high as 1 13  for telecommunications  no surprise there   and as low as 0 10  for daily deals e coupons   This  of course  fluctuates greatly from industry to industry   According to a recent study by SignUpTo   the average email unsubscribe rate is 0 52    Before discovering how to reduce your email unsubscribe rate  then  it s worth knowing what a good unsubscribe rate is  if there s such a thing    You can have the fastest growing online audiences  but if people are opting out as often as others are opting in  you ll have little to show for your efforts   However  there s one thing many people don t write about  something that s on everybody s mind   And with it  many influencers have written about their favorite traffic sources and list building strategies  heck  we ve been guilty of it  too    Reduce email unsubscribe rates with these 7 proven practices  1  Set the expectation for when you re going to email  We ve all been guilty of it   You promise a friend you ll meet them at a certain place at a certain time  but despite your best intentions  for one reason or another  you get caught up and keep your friend waiting   If your friend is understanding they ll forgive you  But if you do it consistently  over time  it will damage your friendship   Why   Because people value consistency in others   When we say we re going to do something and we don t  we become inconsistent   And when we become inconsistent  others begin to doubt our integrity   Similarly  if you want to build trust with your audience  you need to set an expectation for when and how frequently you re going to email   And honor it   Paul Jarvis is a perfect illustration of pacing his readers  expectations   On his landing page  he says he s going to email you every Sunday    and he keeps his word   Granted  no two readers are alike  everyone has their own preference for how frequently they want emails   TED knows this better than anyone   On their newsletter page  they ask when you prefer to be emailed   Takeaway  Set the expectation for when and how often you re going to email your audience and commit to it   2  Use a combination of single and double optins  Speak to any marketer long enough and there s one question that s likely to come up   Do you use single or double optins   A quick refresher   A single optin is when a visitor doesn t need to confirm their subscription  They enter their email address and are immediately added to your list  A double optin is when a visitor is required to confirm their subscription via email   Steve Chou  from My Wife Quit Her Job  grew his list size by 51 3  when he switched from a single to a double optin  On the other hand  research by Mailchimp has found campaigns with double optins have lower spam complaints and unsubscribe rates   While there s no definitive answer to which is more effective  it varies from person to person   both practices have their respective advantages  and disadvantages    A good rule of thumb is this   If you re offering a content upgrade  like I ve done in this article   use a single optin  If you re collecting emails elsewhere  such as your homepage   use a double optin  especially if you re sending them to a thank you page    One of the challenges with using double optins is getting readers to confirm their subscriptions  In fact  as many as 20  of people who opt in on your site won t confirm their email   With the average person receiving as many as 122 emails per day  you need to cut through the noise if you want to get your emails opened   There are a few ways to do that   Derek Halpern from Social Triggers uses urgency in his subject line and body copy   Krrb  on the other hand  give readers an opportunity to confirm they entered the email address correctly    Image Source  ReallyGoodEmails   Give readers a good reason to confirm their email and it will give them an even better reason to stay on your list   Takeaway  Use single optins for content upgrades and double optins for everything else  and try to stand out with your confirmation email   3  Segment your list by interest  We ve all experienced it   And it sucks   You read an article  opt in for a bonus or join a newsletter  and what do you get   Content that s completely irrelevant to what you originally signed up for   In fact  it s the third most common reason why people unsubscribe from emails   What s the solution   Send targeted emails using segments   While sending targeted emails goes beyond the scope of this article  one of the best email marketing practices is to segment your subscribers immediately after joining your newsletter   When you join the Smart Passive Income newsletter  Pat Flynn asks you which option best describes your online business activity   Moreover  he justifies why he s asking  thus  enticing more people to click through   From thereon  you ll only receive emails that are relevant to your goals and challenges   And you re far less likely to unsubscribe   Takeaway  Use segments in your email marketing software and send targeted emails to reduce readers opting out   4  Use normal subject lines  The online marketplace is noisier than ever   And with more and more businesses competing for our attention every day  it s getting harder and harder to cut through the commotion   It s no surprise  then  that many brands are resorting to questionable marketing tactics to get noticed   And that includes using misleading email subject lines   A few things worth avoiding   Using all caps  Writing in caps is the equivalent of yelling at your customers  If you wouldn t consider doing the former  why would you consider doing the latter  Capitalizing words in your subject line not only comes across as obnoxious  it can trigger spam filters  more on that below    Using aggressive or provocative copy  If you ve ever received an email with subject lines like  Do you hate me   or  Open up  This is important   you ve probably done what most people do  unsubscribe  Bullying tactics don t get you far in life  and they won t get you far in marketing  either   Using  spam triggers   What do words like  free    discount   and  now  have in common  They all have the potential to trigger email spam filters  Sure  they might invite more opens  but they re more likely to end up in the readers  spam folder  To learn more about avoiding spam trigger words  read Neil Patel s Definitive Guide to Marketing Automation    Using fake reply indicators  Including  re   or  fwd  when you re not replying or forwarding emails might appear clever  heck  it might even generate more opens   but it also misleads your audience and creates mistrust  It s hard enough to build trust online  but it s even harder to regain once it s lost   Using false scarcity  Scarcity  when used honestly  can be an effective psychological trigger   But using it to create false urgency in your email marketing is a big no no  People aren t stupid  they know when something s about to disappear forever and when it isn t  Don t trick your readers   It s important to mention here  writing normal subject lines isn t about skimping on good copywriting practices  Rather  it s about being as direct as possible with your audience and letting your brand do the heavy lifting   An effective subject line is only as good as the business that s sending it   And if you re building a good reputation online and always nurturing relationships with your customers  writing normal subject lines is what will differentiate you from your competitors   Takeaway  Write to your audience like you would a friend or work colleague  read  no sneaky tactics    5  Revise your copy  We opt out of emails every day   But what few of us realize is  over time  we become conditioned to look for one word in the footer of every email   Unsubscribe   The phrasing of this option varies from one email marketing software to another  but the action doesn t   Unsubscribe   Click   No More Emails  Some companies  though  are challenging readers  expectations by playing around with what s become a standard expectation in email marketing   Some  like Neil Patel  have reworded their copy from  Unsubscribe  to  Update my preferences    Others  like Helpscout  have changed the color of the anchor text and position of their opt out link   Let s be clear  here   This is NOT to trick your reader  Rather  it s to give them other options before opting out  such as changing their email frequency    Another effective copywriting practice is to remind readers how they got on your list  to begin with  this is especially important if you re emailing infrequently as people often forget they even signed up    Michael Hyatt outlines exactly how you got on his list at the footer of every email for this very reason   Give readers a chance to opt out  of course  but always give them more options so they re less inclined to do so   Takeaway  Revise your footer copy so readers have more choices when it comes to opting out of your newsletter  To learn more about good copywriting practices  read How to Write Powerful High Converting Call to Actions   6  Send a follow up email  It s tempting to believe when a customer unsubscribes  you ve lost them forever   But that s not entirely accurate   Many businesses are now experimenting with sending follow up emails to keep readers engaged beyond email   Chris Guillebeau  for example  offers departing readers a chance to resubscribe to his list using an offer different to his original lead magnet   Sean McCabe  on the other hand  goes for a gentler request  asking for a follow on Twitter   It s important to mention here not to assume all readers unsubscribe because of you   Sometimes  people s priorities change  Other times  they re inundated with too many emails  remember the above statistic   Either way  look for opportunities to continue your relationship outside of email   Who knows  one day  it might pay off   Takeaway  Give departing readers a reason to stick around  even if that includes following you on social media    7  Ask for feedback  Another type of follow up email that s popular with influencers is simply asking why a reader opted out   Often  the reason might surprise you   Many email marketing providers offer you an opportunity to survey your departing reader  but few business owners implement it properly   Alex Turnbull from Groove was able to increase customer exit survey responses by 785  by switching from a survey to an open ended question with split tested copy   With those increased results  Alex was able to increase customer satisfaction and reduce churn  a concern for any SaaS business owner    Asking for feedback can be a painful experience  That s a given  But getting constructive feedback can not only improve user experience  it can iterate your customer onboarding process  Win  Win   Takeaway  Follow up with departing readers by asking them why they unsubscribed   Protip  split test how you ask them  As the above example demonstrates  how you ask is as important as why,"[936 814 931 1063 83 117 723 868 154 511 289]"

945,training-dataset/business/169.txt,business,Affordable CareThe Affordable Care Act is far from perfect for one thing  I think health insurance should be entirely separate from employment but I hate the thought of losing it without a replacement for people who will lose insurance  If Congress ends up repealing it  I hope they earnestly try to preserve the best parts  and put in place something better   One thing the ACA definitely did was help a lot of founders start their companies  without it  being a founder would make sense for less people  The Department of Health and Human Services released a lot of new data yesterday showing how the ACA helped support entrepreneurs  and in light of that  I thought it would be good to collect and share stories of how the ACA helped some Y Combinator founders get started   Here they are in the founders  own words   Dan Carroll  Clever  S12  March 3  2012  I m holed up in a hotel room in San Francisco with two of my best friends  wildly excited about the idea that will become Clever  We ve packed the day with difficult conversations   Where will the company be founded  Do we have enough savings  Who will be CEO    but the only topic that I m truly afraid of is health  I ve been living with Crohn s Disease for nearly ten years  and I know that without health care  I d die  and without health insurance  I d go broke  But some quick research tells me that  thanks to the ACA  I can join my parents  healthcare plan until I turn 26 the following January  Risk mitigated  I make the commitment to my cofounders   I m in   Ethan Perlstein  Perlara  W16  I left academia on Jan 1  2013 as unemployed former postdoc  I would not have been able to move across the country to start my company  and my wife wouldn t have given up her employer sponsored health insurance  if not for Obamacare  Also  some of the first employees at Perlara depended on the ACA for insurance   Randall Bennett  VidPresso  W14  There s a good chance that without the aca my startup wouldn t exist    or I d be dead  When launching my startup we couldn t get health insurance because one insurer denied us because I once had a sleep study for sleep apnea  Once you get one rejection  all the others reject you   Then  last year I had a brain tumor  I had moved off to a more normal health plan    but with the last set of rules chances are it d have been unlikely I could have gotten any insurance  let alone a somewhat reasonable plan   Ben Maitland Lewis  Pretty Instant  W15  We aren t yet at a stage where we can offer healthcare to our employees but thanks to the ACA we are all individually insured  This has been instrumental in helping us grow the business while keeping costs low  I hope the next administration doesn t repeal our access to individualized affordable healthcare as it would have a direct effect on the company at this stage   Ravi Parikh  Heap  W13  The provision in ACA that allows young adults to remain on their parents  health insurance until they re 26 has helped me multiple times  In 2011  I was self employed as a musician  which would have been much more difficult to pursue if I weren t able to take advantage of my parents  health insurance  Later  my co founder Matin left his job at Facebook in 2012  He and I worked on a number of side projects  one of which eventually became Heap  Both him and I remained on our parents  insurance until Heap had enough funding and traction to offer health plans to employees  Again  without being able to remain on our parents  insurance  this would have been much more difficult   Mike Romano  Lendsnap  S16  The ACA has been a blessing for me and my family  and without it  I could not pursue my entrepreneurial dreams  I began my new career within days of the birth of my son  and the fact he arrived five weeks early only complicated plans further  My wife is a graphic designer and usually only finds contract work without benefits  The ACA allows me to follow my passion of transforming the mortgage industry while ensuring our son gets the crucial care he needs during his early life   Brian Merritt  Seed  W15  For me  the ACA was life changing  Prior to the ACA I was only able to obtain insurance either through an established group plan  or via Medical Medicaid  last resort  insurance  This was because I have a pre existing condition that made me ineligible to buy an individual insurance plan  Due to having a chronic condition that needs to be managed carefully  having a quality insurance plan was not an option  but a requirement  So my only option was to work for a large employer with an established health plan that would provide me with the appropriate benefits to support my situation  After the ACA made it so that pre existing conditions don t disqualify applicants  I was able to purchase an individual insurance plan outside of my employer  and as as a result I was able to start a company and work on it for almost two years before we were able to put our own group plan together   Mick Johnson  Whereoscope  S10  The ACA was essential when starting my new business   I founded the company  was pre funding for 9 months  and the only employee  so was unable to get small group coverage  I have a wife  a child  and another child on the way so health insurance was essential  Without the ACA I could never have left a regular job to found this new company  which has now raised funding and employs 7 people   Kevin Law  Cambly  W14  I had to apply for individual health care twice while starting Cambly before the ACA exchanges launched at the end of 2013  It was incredibly difficult and expensive  because I had to keep paying for expensive COBRA coverage from my previous employer while repeatedly applying  appealing  and getting rejected by insurers for individual plans  I was still on a group plan during the ACA debates and assumed that the only people getting rejected were the chronically ill  I learned through my experience that nearly anyone who had past health care expenses would often be rejected when applying for individual plans  as was my case    An especially ironic moment occurred when I was on a Blue Cross group plan via COBRA and appealing a rejection for a Blue Cross individual plan  I got a physical  so my doctor could write a letter saying I was in good health for the appeal  I simultaneously received a rejection letter for my individual plan appeal citing pasts health costs AND a letter from my group plan asking if the physical was related to a workplace incident  presumably so they could sue someone to get reimbursed for the costs    The exchanges finally went live at the end of 2013  and I quickly got insurance coverage  No extensive health history paperwork  No rejections or appeals  It launched right around when we got into YC  so it was great to focus on building and growing our business rather than trying to obtain health insurance   Tristan Tao  Leada  S15  I m currently 24 years old  going on 25   I am fortunately covered under my parent s health insurance under ACA  until I m 26   This was critical in reducing my personal burn  I would not go without health insurance  this meant I d have to either join a larger company to gain coverage  or purchase them out of pocket  Either way it would ve significantly hindered the 22 yrs old me to start a company as a Senior in College   I strongly hope that the successor of Obamacare will include a clause that makes it cheaper for recent graduates to get coverage  or retain the current policy of enabling people younger than 26 to stay on their parents  coverage    Looking back  the largest hindrance to starting a company would ve been debt  which I didn t have any   and personal burn  insurance being a huge part    Ram Jayaraman  PlateIQ  S15  5 out of 7 members of the initial team at Plate IQ were on ACA  Without ACA in the early days we would have to spend large amounts on employer health insurance and since the team was small we would not have gotten much discounts either  Since the team just needed something basic until we raise decent venture money  they were all able to find very affordable options with good networks like Kaiser   In thinking of an ACA successor  very few plans are coupled with HSA accounts and HSA withdrawals are penalized  For startups with young teams I would ideally like to continue getting plans with large deductibles and large co pays and instead contribute to an HSA account  Avoiding the 20  penalty for the HSA withdrawal would definitely encourage more participation   Ben Thompson  Gitprime  W16  I have a family of 5  Had it not been for the affordable care act  it would have been incredibly difficult to take the leap to become a co founder  Because of the ACA  I was able to take a calculated career risk without having to sacrifice health coverage for my family as part of that decision  Two years later  we ve built a company that provides benefits for all of our employees and their dependents   Brendan Lim  Kicksend  S11  In 2009 my wife was in a life threatening car accident  After her recovery  she was unable to get reasonably priced coverage due to her new  pre existing conditions   During this time  my co founder and I had quit our jobs and started working on Kicksend  S11  and were living off of our savings  As a result  we were unable to afford reasonable insurance  The ACA removed the  pre existing conditions  and gave us peace of mind since my wife was finally able to get covered   Vishal Joshi  Joy  S16  When we started Joy  we had insurance as dependents and did not need to create company healthcare offer for a bit  But soon we had a new employee very eager to join Joy but needed health insurance  We agreed to start the process but it so happens that the entire ordeal to get company healthcare setup takes a couple of months  If not for ACA  Joy would had lost a really good employee who is still with us and actually helped us build our website  She was able to keep afloat using ACA while we got our company policy setup   Jason Chen  Verge Genomics  S15  The Affordable Care Act makes it easy for us to purchase and manage health insurance plans   all of our employees are covered rapidly with no medical underwriting  However  we pay high premiums  incur rising deductibles  and plans are bloated with benefits we cannot use  We have also had to pay for  retroactive coverage  for some employees to avoid penalties from the individual mandate  even though no services were used  Future patient centered health reform should facilitate access to coverage for small business and individuals while allowing greater customization of benefits   Zachary Garbow  SocialBrowse  W08  When I began working on my startup full time  my wife and I wanted to start a family  At that time  when trying to purchase private insurance being pregnant was considered a pre existing condition  My wife also had undertaken some preventative procedures years earlier  which made it difficult to obtain coverage  As a result  we were stressed and anxious about not being able to get coverage  and fearful that we d not be covered for our pregnancy and I d have to quit my startup to find a corporate job with health insurance  Luckily  the ACA passed just in time to provide us the peace of mind to both start our family and continue building my startup  We now have 2 kids and a thriving  growing business   Varun Aroroa  OpenCurriculum  W14  ACA has allowed me to have health insurance  Before I got on Obamacare  I had no insurance and had stopped all physical activity beyond basic exercise for years  being too scared to hurt myself  Living below the adjusted poverty line  I just can t afford normal plans  It is amazing how much mental comfort and freedom it can bring in life   Mike Knoop  Zapier  S12  Thanks to the ACA and my parents  the provision to cover dependents through the age of 26 enabled me to take more risk starting Zapier  Specifically  I did not have to worry about healthcare coverage when the company was small and could not afford health benefits  Now  Zapier provides health benefit coverage to our 50  US employees   Zachariah Reitano  Shout  S14  I had heart surgery when I was 18  I was virtually uninsurable  I now have health insurance  Why we need the ACA is no more complicated than that,"[945 51 1293 131 801 538 561 1316 456 362 1073]"
956,training-dataset/engineering/259.txt,engineering,The traits of a proficient programmerAbstract  source  Pixabay     Start reading Programming Beyond Practices  by Gregory Brown   Do you know what the difference between competence and proficiency is   That sounds like a trick question  because the words seem to mean the same thing  But the subtle distinction between them is critically important   Competence means having enough experience and knowledge to get stuff done  proficiency involves knowing why you are doing something in a certain way  and how it fits into the big picture  In other words  a proficient practitioner is always a competent practitioner  but the opposite may not be true   The Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition covers this topic in great detail  Although its title sounds a bit academic  the paper is very approachable and it has an amazing cover page that will make you feel like you re reading a secret Illuminati cable that you found in some hidden library in a haunted house   Figure 1  Cover page from  A Five Stage Model of the Mental Activities Involved in Directed Skill Acquisition  by Dreyfus  Stuart E   Dreyfus  Hubert L   February 1980   Washington  DC  Storming Media   I recommend reading the original source material for a great overview of the path from beginner to expert  But in this article  I will focus on the bottleneck for most software developers I ve known  crossing the divide from competence to proficiency   So first  let s establish a working definition of competence as just meaning  I know how to do stuff  it s an oversimplification  but it s close enough for our needs  It s fair to say that no matter what kind of occupation you work in  knowing how to do stuff is pretty important  If you are a programmer  learning how to do stuff is a huge part of your work   I need to know how to use revision control  I need to know how to use a consistent coding style  I need to know how to set up a continuous integration server  I need to know how to query a database  I need to know how to implement a responsive layout  I need to know how to work with a service API  And don t get me wrong  Knowing how to do stuff  and a lot of it  is critically important  Don t stop working on that  or you ll soon find yourself out a job   But the place where the intermediate programmer tends to get stuck  and many end up stuck there for life  is thinking that the difference between a beginner and an expert can be measured in how much stuff you know  That s only half correct  and it emphasizes the less important half   This is where proficiency comes in  And at its essence  proficiency is about  why you do things a certain way  It s the difference between understanding each of the parts of a problem individually  and understanding how the parts fit into the whole   The gap between competence and proficiency may explain why so many people struggle with high level programming ideas  like design patterns   A competent programmer can surely read up on the Memento Pattern and understand how to implement it  They would likely even be able identify scenarios where the pattern can be applied  perhaps to implement an undo operation within a GUI   But without knowing more about the big picture  they may still end up applying the pattern inappropriately   By contrast  a proficient programmer is able to identify when the Memento Pattern breaks down  for example  if you are copying large amounts of data  or making a large number of copies   They might know of some alternative options to consider if the pattern wasn t a perfect fit  They would also have some ideas on how to take the basic concepts behind Memento  and then adapt them to create a custom solution that is a better fit for their particular use case   Far more importantly  a proficient programmer is capable of identifying the right and wrong times to talk about design patterns at all if building a proof of concept feature  the question of proper code design is potentially irrelevant  If explaining a codebase to a beginner  a proficient developer may decide to stick to the basics of what the code is actually doing rather than throwing out named patterns and telling a novice  Go read the Gang of Four before asking me any questions    And so with proficiency  comes the flexibility of a holistic mindset   Patterns  principles  idioms  libraries  language features these are all tools  But a truly proficient programmer fits the tool to the job  not the other way around   Many never specifically focus on developing proficiency  because frankly  it is more straightforward to develop competence  But should you want to shift your focus and need some help getting started  here are a few ideas to try out   Explain the reasoning for why you want to do something a certain way  but don t rely on generic  best practices  or community guidelines  Discuss pros and cons solely in the context of the current problem you are solving   Learn fewer things  better  Then try to apply them in many different contexts  and see where they work well  and where they don t  Use failures to identify opportunities to seek new tools that might help broaden your skill set  but only once you ve established a clear need   Look for examples of when others  break the rules  and are met with success  Occasionally break some of your own rules and see whether it hurts you  helps you  or leads to no change   Dig into primary sources rather than just reading summaries  It takes more work  but helps you figure out both the basis and the boundaries of a technique  and also gives you an opportunity to generate new ideas of your own that are inspired by core principles   Drop yourself into the deep end in a project that you are mostly unfamiliar with  and then try to find your way around without relying on your memorized routines  habits  and rules   Ask others to explain why they do things  but don t just accept dogmatic reasoning  Demand examples and inquire about context  so that you can try to imagine what it is like to be in their shoes  Doing this is tremendously valuable because it allows you to see the strengths and weaknesses of ideas in their natural habitats   Pick a small number of specific skills you re simply good but not great at  and then develop competence to an extreme  almost obsessive degree  Get to the point that you re better at that particular tiny corner of the world than nearly anyone else you know  Once you get there  examine the pros and cons of deep but highly specific knowledge   The thing about proficiency is that a little goes a long way  You need an extraordinary level of competence to be able to stand out on  knowing stuff  but even a loose grasp on  knowing how to use the right stuff  at the right time  will take you far   And here is the best part  once you start focusing on proficiency  there s a good chance that you will end up finding the true path to mastery   Editor s note  Gregory Brown is working on a book about the non code aspects of software development  called Programming Beyond Practices  Follow its progress here,"[956 1062

963,training-dataset/business/1039.txt,business,Is  being authentic  easier said than done The Authenticity Gap Is  being authentic  easier said than done   In a recent newsletter I encouraged you to be authentic in the workplace  to make sure your work self is a reflection of your true self  The newsletter was generally well received  with a lot of positive feedback   I also got some heartfelt responses that helped me realize how difficult it can be to just  be yourself  when you re a member of an underrepresented minority group  So today  I m going to highlight some of these voices on the challenges they face being authentic in the workplace   Slack product manager Jules Walter wrote a Medium piece with his thoughts   In general  many minorities choose not to speak up because they don t want to jeopardize their careers  be disliked  feel like victims  or because their opinions have been ignored in the past  Even if your minority coworkers do not verbalize the isolation and  otherness  that they experience  it does not mean they feel as if they can act authentically  true to themselves  or thrive    We can all contribute to finding solutions  but many people in tech don t bother looking for those solutions because they fail to see the problem in the first place   A reader who would like to be known as  MRW  wrote to me   Managers must first be willing to undertake the very difficult task of self reflection and self examination for bias  prejudice and racism  followed by the necessary anti racism training  Only then can we be truly competent in creating an environment we all feel safe  supported and appreciated  People of color can very easily detect when a manager especially a manager who is not of color isn t genuine  Anyone can learn the  right  things to say and do  which is all too often the case   Some other writers I admire have also addressed the topic  Former Googler and current Slack engineer Erica Baker wrote   I am working on re establishing my authentic self  This process is scary and difficult and will take some time and work  I have to search through myself and figure out what characteristics I ve dropped in order to fit in  I have to sift through my personality and pick out the bits that aren t really me  I have to understand who I am without the detritus of the habits and behaviors I ve picked up while trying to assimilate   Makinde Adeagbo shared an experience where being himself meant feeling ostracized   I thought about all the discussions I d heard about being able to bring one s full self to work  Why should I have to filter and hide my past to avoid the spotlight  I truthfully told my interview story and  as I had expected  the room went silent  It felt as if the entire session had stopped and no one knew what to say  Sadly  I wasn t able to regain my focus for the rest of the meeting   And my former JotSpot and Google co worker Leslie Miley shared   Is a prerequisite to working in tech as a minority that one is expected to  in the eyes of the majority  sublimate your racial identity to ensure a cultural fit   As these writers remind us  authenticity isn t so easy when you re reminded at every turn that you re an outsider  They speak to the importance of awareness  and working to create an environment where employees and co workers  especially minorities  feel that the company gets it  Welcoming authenticity in others is even more important than finding it in yourself   I suggest you read and reflect on each of these pieces  Thank you to everyone who shared their thoughts on this topic  and in particular to Jules Walter for reviewing drafts   Good Reads  Adam Grant s op ed from The New York Times takes the extreme view   Unless You re Oprah   Be Yourself  Is Terrible Advice   The title is certainly provocative  but Grant seems to think authenticity means that every thought that crosses your mind exits your lips   A decade ago  the author A  J  Jacobs spent a few weeks trying to be totally authentic  He announced to an editor that he would try to sleep with her if he were single and informed his nanny that he would like to go on a date with her if his wife left him  He informed a friend s 5 year old daughter that the beetle in her hands was not napping but dead  He told his in laws that their conversation was boring  You can imagine how his experiment worked out   Um  no  To me  authenticity means narrowing the distance between who I am  and who you think I am  I cease trying to be someone else and start trying to be myself  As I wrote before  authenticity doesn t mean acting exactly the same in different environments  Grant finishes   Next time people say   just be yourself   stop them in their tracks  No one wants to hear everything that s in your head  They just want you to live up to what comes out of your mouth   And to that  I will agree  In fact   live up to what comes out of your mouth  sounds to me like an excellent definition of authenticity   Global internet and smartphone user growth is slowing  That s one of the conclusions from Mary Meeker s Internet Trends Report  Higher penetration in developed markets means growth is leveling off  In developing markets  smartphones are still extremely expensive  15  of per capita income in Vietnam  for example    The Breakout List  Thanks to reader Niraj Pant for sending me a link

967,training-dataset/business/1469.txt,business,The Software RevolutionIn human history  there have been three great technological revolutions and many smaller ones  The three great ones are the agricultural revolution  the industrial revolution  and the one we are now in the middle of the software revolution   1   The great technological revolutions have affected what most people do every day and how society is structured  The previous one  the industrial revolution  created lots of jobs because the new technology required huge numbers of humans to run it  But this is not the normal course of technology  it was an anomaly in that sense  And it makes people think  perhaps subconsciously  that technological revolutions are always good for most people s personal economic status   It appears that the software revolution will do what technology usually does create wealth but destroy jobs  Of course  we will probably find new things to do to satisfy limitless human demand  But we should stop pretending that the software revolution  by itself  is going to be good for median wages   Technology provides leverage on ability and luck  and in the process concentrates wealth and drives inequality  I think that drastic wealth inequality is likely to be one of the biggest social problems of the next 20 years   2  We can and we will redistribute wealth  but it still doesn t solve the real problem of people needing something fulfilling to do   Trying to hold on to worthless jobs is a terrible but popular idea  Trying to find new jobs for billions of people is a good idea but obviously very hard because whatever the new jobs are  they will probably be so fundamentally different from anything that exists today that meaningful planning is almost impossible  But the current strategy  let s just pretend that Travis is kidding when he talks about self driving cars and that Uber really is going to create millions of jobs forever  is not the right answer   The second major challenge of the software revolution is the concentration of power in small groups  This also happens with most technological revolutions  but the last truly terrifying technology  the atomic bomb  taught us bad lessons in a similar way to the industrial revolution and job growth   It is hard to make an atomic bomb not because the knowledge is restricted  though it is if I  hypothetically  knew how to make an atomic bomb  it would be tremendously illegal for me to say anything about it  but because it takes huge amounts of energy to enrich Uranium  One effectively needs the resources of nations to do it   3   Again  this is not the normal course for technology it was an idiosyncrasy of nuclear development  The software revolution is likely to do what technology usually does  and make more power available to small groups   Two of the biggest risks I see emerging from the software revolution AI and synthetic biology may put tremendous capability to cause harm in the hands of small groups  or even individuals  It is probably already possible to design and produce a terrible disease in a small lab  development of an AI that could end human life may only require a few hundred people in an office building anywhere in the world  with no equipment other than laptops   The new existential threats won t require the resources of nations to produce  A number of things that used to take the resources of nations building a rocket  for example are now doable by companies  at least partially enabled by software  But a rocket can destroy anything on earth   What can we do  We can t make the knowledge of these things illegal and hope it will work  We can t try to stop technological progress   I think the best strategy is to try to legislate sensible safeguards but work very hard to make sure the edge we get from technology on the good side is stronger than the edge that bad actors get  If we can synthesize new diseases  maybe we can synthesize vaccines  If we can make a bad AI  maybe we can make a good AI that stops the bad one   The current strategy is badly misguided  It s not going to be like the atomic bomb this time around  and the sooner we stop pretending otherwise  the better off we ll be  The fact that we don t have serious efforts underway to combat threats from synthetic biology and AI development is astonishing   To be clear  I m a fan of the software revolution and I feel fortunate I was born when I was  But I worry we learned the wrong lessons from recent examples  and these two issues huge scale destruction of jobs  and concentration of huge power are getting lost        1  A lot of the smaller ones have been very important  like the hand axe  incidentally  the hand axe is the longest serving piece of technology in human history   writing  cannons  the internal combustion engine  atomic bombs  fishing  many people believe that fishing is what allowed us to develop the brains that we have now   and many more    2  It is true that life is better in an absolute sense than it was a hundred years ago even for very poor people  Most of the stuff that people defending current levels of wealth inequality say is also true highly paid people do indeed make inexpensive services for poor people   However  ignoring quality of life relative to other people alive today feels like it ignores what make us human  I think it s a good thing when some people make thousands of times as much money as what other people make  but I also don t resent paying my taxes and think we should do much more to help people that are actually poor  The social safety net will have to trend up with the development of technology    3  Or at least  one used to  http   en wikipedia org wiki Separation_of_isotopes_by_laser_excitation,"[967 71 1011 154

982,training-dataset/product/1212.txt,product,A behavioral approach to product designChanging behavior is hard  We see it every day New Year s resolutions fall through  gym memberships remain unused  and well intentioned plans to eat less or save more never come to fruition   There are many products and services to help nudge us towards our goals whether that s making healthier eating choices  developing better financial habits  or maintaining a more active lifestyle  Yet creating products that successfully accomplish these objectives can be immensely difficult  Designers are realizing that traditional design methods are not always enough to effectively tackle these complex behavioral challenges   At Opower  our team takes a uniquely behavioral approach to product design  leveraging the latest behavioral science research to create useful  delightful user experiences that motivate everyone on earth to save energy  Understanding the psychology and science behind how people interpret information  make decisions  and take action enables us to deliver more effective designs  And in doing so  we ve successfully changed people s habits and helped customers save over  1 billion on their energy bills   The 4 stages of behavior design  Recently  our team developed a simple 4 stage framework that we use to guide our design process and evaluate the behavioral effectiveness of our products  In this article  we ll introduce the framework and describe techniques that all designers can use to ensure their products are as engaging  persuasive  and actionable as possible   Stage 1  Grab attention  The first thing people want to know  Why should I care  As designers  we may have a fantastic product  but nobody will ever know if we can t get people to pay attention to our message and consider using our product   Techniques  Make it inviting  Draw people in with eye catching aesthetics  engaging storytelling  or compelling motion design   Draw people in with eye catching aesthetics  engaging storytelling  or compelling motion design  Elicit an emotional reaction  Create designs that stand out and remain memorable by appealing to our emotions   whether that s surprise  curiosity  or urgency  e g  using techniques like scarcity or loss aversion      whether that s surprise  curiosity  or urgency  e g  using techniques like scarcity or loss aversion   Show personalized content  People respond strongly to messaging that is customized and relevant based on their behaviors  interests  and values   Examples  Airbnb creates a strong first impression on their front page with compelling imagery and videos  The language is warm and inviting  drawing users in and encouraging them to explore the site   creates a strong first impression on their front page with compelling imagery and videos  The language is warm and inviting  drawing users in and encouraging them to explore the site  Mint sends emails notifying customers of unusual spending patterns  These emails effectively grab our attention because they are both personalized and emotional the message is surprising  and possibly alarming   which compels us to investigate further   Stage 2  Influence decisions  Once people are interested and engaged  we need to present a clear  convincing argument that nudges them to take action   Techniques  Examples  Opower has encouraged millions of homes to reduce their energy use by using social comparison  showing them how much they use compared to similar homes in the area   Although people don t typically think much about their energy use  this information is powerfully influential  getting people to reconsider their energy habits and find ways to use less   has encouraged millions of homes to reduce their energy use by using social comparison  showing them how much they use compared to similar homes in the area   Although people don t typically think much about their energy use  this information is powerfully influential  getting people to reconsider their energy habits and find ways to use less  Kickstarter and other crowdfunding sites use several methods to influence our decision to make pledges  Projects frequently offer both extrinsic benefits  e g  early access to a product  and intrinsic benefits  e g  pride in supporting a cause you care about   Pledge recommendations are reinforced with behavioral science techniques like social proof  how many people have pledged  and scarcity  limited time and limited spots for each pledge tier    Stage 3  Facilitate action  After a person has made the decision to act  the next step is to help them follow through  making the action as easy and barrier free as possible   Techniques  Simplify the action  Break down target actions into small  achievable steps  Reduce cognitive load on a user by simplifying an interface   chunking information  or introducing progressive disclosure  Identify and address common barriers that prevent people from taking action   Break down target actions into small  achievable steps    chunking information  or introducing progressive disclosure  Identify and address common barriers that prevent people from taking action  Guide the experience  Shape the experience in a way that facilitates action  Common techniques include walkthroughs  callouts  or pre determined defaults   Shape the experience in a way that facilitates action  Common techniques include walkthroughs  callouts  or pre determined defaults  Help users create a plan  Encourage people to set goals and commit to actions  Send reminders and follow up on their progress over time   Encourage people to set goals and commit to actions  Send reminders and follow up on their progress over time  Trigger at the right moment  Timing is critical make sure you trigger a person to take action during the times they are most motivated and able to take action   Examples  Brigade   a startup that encourages people to discuss their opinions on news and political issues  recently created several tools to facilitate the voting process  Right before election day  the app helped people find their local polling place and provided voting recommendations based on a user s responses to several issue based questions     a startup that encourages people to discuss their opinions on news and political issues  recently created several tools to facilitate the voting process  Right before election day  the app helped people find their local polling place and provided voting recommendations based on a user s responses to several issue based questions  ZenPayroll Giving makes charitable donations easy by removing friction and allowing employees to make contributions directly from their paychecks through regular  automatic withdrawals  Donations are then automatically documented on an employee s W 2 at the end of the year   Stage 4  Sustain behavior  Taking action once is not enough  For products to truly have a long lasting impact  our designs need to motivate people to continue their behavior and feel a sense of progress over time   Techniques  Celebrate progress  Reward people with positive feedback and show progress over time  Consider a variable rewards schedule to increase engagement and reinforce behavior change   Reward people with positive feedback and show progress over time  Consider a variable rewards schedule to increase engagement and reinforce behavior change  Build a long term relationship  Rather than one time communications  design for experiences that extend over time and improve as we learn more about the people using our products   and improve as we learn more about the people using our products  Emphasize intrinsic motivation  Intrinsic motivation is the strongest driver of long term behavior change  Research shows that people are drawn to experiences that give them a sense of purpose  social connection  status  self expression  mastery  and autonomy   Examples  Nest sends monthly reports that display a customer s energy use patterns over time  For people who don t manage their thermostat settings day to day  these engaging infographics provide an opportunity to show how Nest helps saves energy and money  Also  badges like  leafs  and  kudos  appeal to our internal sense of status and competition   sends monthly reports that display a customer s energy use patterns over time  For people who don t manage their thermostat settings day to day  these engaging infographics provide an opportunity to show how Nest helps saves energy and money  Also  badges like  leafs  and  kudos  appeal to our internal sense of status and competition  Runkeeper and other fitness apps use various techniques to help us sustain behavior long term  Users can set activity goals and keep track of their progress  both individually and as part of a social group  Personal bests  leaderboards  and ongoing positive feedback help trigger our intrinsic motivations for self mastery  social connection  and status   Final thoughts  As designers  we need to consider the range of experiences people go through when using our products understanding what nudges them to begin caring  take action  and stay motivated and engaged over time  Applying a behavioral lens to our work helps identify what stages in the journey are working and which could be better  ultimately strengthening our designs and mitigating the risk that our products will be quickly ignored or forgotten   We hope this framework is useful to other designers looking for ways to incorporate behavioral thinking into their design

985,training-dataset/business/528.txt,business,Autodesk s Maria Giudice on creating an experience centered companyMaria Giudice is a people person  particularly when it comes to product design  She s currently the Vice President of Experience Design at Autodesk  a maker of software for makers themselves   architects  engineers  industrial designers and construction teams are all users of their more than 140 products  Maria s challenge  one she embarked on a year and a half ago following her run as Product Design Director at Facebook  is to make sure each of those products provide a consistent experience that puts users first  Prior to Autodesk and Facebook  Maria founded the influential experience design firm Hot Studio  She has written several books on design  and her latest  coauthored with Christopher Ireland  is Rise of the DEO  Leadership by Design  In my chat with Maria  we cover what it means to be an experience centered company  why everyone in your company needs exposure to customers  how to tackle guerrilla research  and much more  If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the interview  but if you re short on time  here are five key takeaways  Silos are a major blocker to creating great user experiences  They lead teams to work in the best interest of their specific group  rather than the organization  It s the job of everyone  from the CEO to interns  to get exposure to customers  This can be ethnographic research  support conversations  qualitative studies   even joining the conversation in online forums  Research should be a continuous input to your developmental cycle  and any research is better than no research  As you design at scale  even the tiniest adjustments can have massive ramifications  Product builders must learn to test  iterate and evolve as they roll changes out to the masses  Social intelligence is crucial trait for leaders  because  as Maria puts it   We need empathy across borders  and social intelligence is really a driver for connection   Adam Risman  Maria  welcome to the show  To get started  could you summarize the work you re doing at Autodesk and what unique challenges led you to joining such a large  global company with more than 140 products  Maria Giudice  My current incarnation is Vice President of Experience Design at Autodesk  I ve been in the role for about a year and a half  and one of the reasons I was really attracted to this role is that Autodesk is a great company  They were actually clients of mine back when I was leading Hot Studio  Also  Carl Bass  the CEO  is featured in my book as a DEO  so I had a lot of affectionate affiliations for the company  Autodesk  like so many companies that preceded the internet  was born as a technology company  Autodesk is 34 years old and it got it s fame and fortune from AutoCAD  and from AutoCAD  it grew to support architects  engineers  construction people  makers  industrial designers  and all those are manifested in the suite of products  The company is rooted in technology   AutoCAD  a commercial design and drafting software  was first released in 1982  Prior to the internet  we were just happy when technology worked  We were grateful  I remember the days of Photoshop 1 0  You would rotate an object and then go to sleep  and by the time you d wake up the object would finish rotating  We were happy  it was a miracle  but those days don t exist anymore  We have whole generations of people who not only don t want to think about technology  they expect it to work  and it s more about driving a better experience  That becomes a competitive differentiator and it will drive the market  Autodesk has to grow up  like so many companies  from being technology centered to becoming experience centered  and that is an awesome problem to try to solve  Establishing a healthy culture Adam  That must have required one hell of a culture change  so what exactly are the tenets of a healthy experience centered design culture  Maria  First of all  change is really hard  People hate change  but Autodesk was ripe for it  Moving from technology to experience centered  the first thing is admitting that you need to do that  That s half the battle  If a company knows they are rooted in technology  and they realize they have to modernize and become an experience driven company  that realization is the first move  Then it becomes an issue of how  First of all  a company that is experience centered are insane advocates for their customers  They know who their customers are  they believe in research to drive insights  and they re making business decisions and technology decisions based on what customers need  want  and desire  Traditionally  companies would really think about what their business drivers are or what the technology can do and back into how to serve that customer  It s the opposite with an experience driven company  you start with people  That s the first driver of a healthy company  The other one is to get out of silos and start thinking in systems  A lot of traditional companies are organized through silos and you live and die by the org that you re in  Oftentimes  you may not be working in the best interest of the customer because you re actually working in the best interest of your organization  or you re not really seeing the seams of your organization  You don t see that those seams  in fact  get exposed to customers  Adam  A lot of times you might be passing those silos along your customers too  When they see an inconsistent experience  it s probably because there was a hand off from one team to another when there should have been collaboration  Maria  A very healthy company is actually thinking about their company as a series of systems and connections  A large part of my job is to work across the company to unify and simplify those connections on behalf of our customers  Adam  You ve hinted at these a little bit  but what were the patterns or root causes you identified at Autodesk that were blocking this  I m sure they re not unique to Autodesk  Maria  Not unique at all  When I joined Autodesk  my boss asked   How are you going to start  what are you going to work on   I don t know  but one thing that I have been trained to do  and this is in my book  is treat every problem like a design problem  Any business problem can be a design problem  so you follow a design process  The very first thing I did was go on a listening tour  I said   Give me three months   There are 9 000 employees at Autodesk and I was going to try to listen to every single one of them  Now  that s not possible  but I did manage to listen to hundreds of people and it was all the way from the CEO down to interns  You don t go for the organizational hierarchy  you cut across the organization and you talk to people  I asked them a few questions   what keeps you up at night in your job  what s preventing you from doing a good job  what are your hopes and dreams  and how can I be of help  Building a strong culture is relevant no matter what size you are  From that  I collected the symptoms  Big one is silos  In every company there are organizational silos that get in the way of innovation  Another is the mindset about design in and of itself  A lot of companies don t understand that design is a verb  not a noun  Design is not a thing a few people do after the fact  it s part of the process  It s not an outcome  and in fact  everybody s responsible for it  Agile becomes this magic word that means many different things  depending on who you re talking to   inconsistent agile processes  a lack of unified understanding of who their customer is  Every org has their customers and they think they re special  so they have special use cases for their special customers  Then you have this real complex understanding of actually who we re trying to serve  Those are just a few of the symptoms that I uncovered along the way  Adam  Thinking of those that are more in the earlier stages of their company s developments  what can they do ahead of time to keep those blockers from emerging  Maria  I ran a company for 15 years  which started with one employee and grew to 100  so I completely understand the pain points when you re one person  10 people  25  35  and 50  and then 75 and above  Each size has a very different set of problems  but there are consistent growing pains that cut across  Building a strong culture is relevant no matter what size you are  If you think of Maslow s hierarchy of needs  where you put culture on the bottom and quality at the top  you can t really talk about shipping quality work until you actually have a culture where people feel that you re listening to them  that they feel heard  appreciated  and like part of the solution  that you re motivating them to do their best work  All of that stuff happens at the very  very bottom  That is true whether you re 10  25 or 50  I would argue as you get bigger you have to pay more attention  because it s easy to lose sight of culture  How research can spark change Adam  As you get bigger there are also more layers of the actual business to permeate through  How can design leaders show the value of change to those people that are less familiar with the mindset they re approaching problems with  Maria  How do you justify investing in change  That s a hard one  right  Because  for me  Autodesk acknowledged they needed to change and I came in as a change agent  In a lot of ways  the heavy lifting was already done for me  For people who are inside a company and want to be change agents  there are many different ways you can do that  First  find your tribe  Who are the people in the company that are like minded  Who are the people that you can unionize to conduct a movement or a revolution  There s this great video clip that I saw at a TED conference about how to start a movement  embedded below   It talks about the lone nut  and it s not really the lone nut that creates the revolution  it s actually the first person that believes in the lone nut  The first follower actually becomes the change agent  and then people follow the follower  and that s how you build a momentum to drive a wellspring change  That s a bottom up approach  The top line approach to change is ultimately getting to quality and customers  If you re going to have a better culture  if you need to invest in design  what are those levers that are going to improve customers  experiences and how do you measure that  How do you show customer pain  I think everybody in their company should do a customer tour of duty  Every single person  There are people at Autodesk  and like other companies  where you re working on a product and you re actually not even using the product that you re actually designing  Use the product  The other thing is listen in to customer complaint calls  You want change to happen  Have your CEO listen in to a customer complaint call  Have your middle managers listen in to angry customers  Have your middle managers  who are usually the troublemakers  actually walk through a customer scenario themselves  It should be part of every person s job to be exposed to customers  This could be ethnographic research  trawling the forums  listening to customer complaint calls  qualitative studies  but it should be part of every person s job to be exposed to customers  When I was working in the early days of the internet  Schwab was one of my clients  One of the things I thought was brilliant was the VPs at Schwab had to do customer calls  they had to actually do support on behalf of customers  and I thought that that was the most amazing idea  Talk about instant empathy  When I talk about research  it s really exposure to customers  Adam  That s probably much more difficult to do at a company your size than  say  an early stage startup  Maria  An early stage  bring your entire team on customer calls  don t relegate it to the designer or the PM or a sales channel  The development team  the PM team  the design team  they should all go and participate in research together  Because when you actually delegate a person to go do research  they see the burden  and then it s their job to express what they saw to stakeholders  If you send a whole team out for a day and do ethnographic studies  then they come back with shorthand  You don t even have to do a report  You could be  what was the big insight  what was the thing that we saw  Can we agree that we have to fix that  It makes the process move so much more efficiently  Adam  Everyone knows the importance of research  but resources can often be scarce for an early stage company  What sort of low friction ways can they do research  When I was in the early days of Hot Studio or when clients didn t believe in research  they didn t believe in paying for it  we would do guerrilla research  One of my clients was SF MOMA  I had the entire development team hang out in the lobby and ask people questions  They came back and they had that insight that really drove the product decisions on behalf of SF MOMA   How to approach research with very limited time and budget  Click to enlarge  Total guerrilla research  You have to do a combination of quantitative studies  like surveys looking at analytics  and you have to use qualitative studies  Because if you solely go by analytics  which a lot of people do because it s easy  it tells you the what but it doesn t tell you the why  Quantitative studies don t allow you to ask follow up questions  Qualitative gives you the richness of the why  but it may not give you the justification based on numbers alone  You have to have a combination  and there are a ton of quick and dirty methods that will get you results  Research should be a continuous input  It s not like you carve out research and say  now  we re going to do research  Research should be a continuous input that is on top of a development cycle  The other argument you hear is that research slows down the development team  No  not when you have a research plan from beginning to end  When you re actually doing agile and you re doing sprints  it never really ends anyway  You use research as top line checks and balances  It s not just about validation  That s the other thing that s common is the perspective of put it out there in the wild  get people to use it  learn from it  and change it  That s great in theory and it works many parts of the time  but the downside of that is you re potentially putting out really bad product experiences and you are taking a debt   a hit on trust  It takes a lot longer to build back trust than it does to actually invest in making sure that you have tested something before it gets put out there that doesn t hit the trust threshold  Testing vs  releasing Adam  You re balancing two pretty important factors there  One is that there s only one chance at a first impression  whether that s a product  feature  blog post  marketing asset  etc  The other is that at the same time  shipping is only the beginning of the process  Maria  I worked at Facebook prior to working at Autodesk  and I learned so much at Facebook  One of the things that was pretty amazing at Facebook was designing at scale  I learned that changing one little thing could have huge ramifications  Facebook s content hits millions of people at the same time  Facebook is a master at having highly effective  small teams working and putting things out very quickly  They constantly put things out  Facebook is different every second and not everybody gets to see the same experience  There s little nuances along the way  Facebook s great at   we have this idea  so let s test it   I always remember testing to 1  of the population for Facebook  1   when I was there  was the country of New Zealand  New Zealand gets the latest and greatest Facebook experiments  and Facebook gets to learn from that sample set  The country of New Zealand  Then they have a rollout strategy  They test  they iterate  they evolve  and then when they have high confidence  they ll go from 1  to 5   iterate and learn  When I started at Autodesk it was the same philosophy  I d hear they were going to put stuff out in the wild and test it  Fantastic  what percentage of your user base are you testing  If the answer is all  that s not testing  You have to know the difference between testing and releasing  Adam  What you re going to learn is it s too late to fix at that point  Maria  Then you ve built the debt  right  Big companies  small companies  they all grapple with the value of research  The other lever I pull is if you re not going to invest in hiring a researcher or researchers  you re having your developers and your designers doing the research activities  which then slows you down  You have one person who has to stop and do what they re doing  do the research  start up  and design or build  Having a researcher makes the process move a lot more efficiently because they get to work concurrently with the other disciplines  Moments of delight Adam  You ve said that unlike physical products  emotion still isn t considered as much as it should be in digital product design  Facebook is a great example of a place that does consider this  Same with ridesharing apps  We know that the cars on the map may not be accurate  but you get these little moments of delight from seeing them move  Who else is doing this well and what can we learn from them  Maria  I think something came out about Uber that when you actually launch the app and see the cars in the ecosystem  that s not really an accurate depiction   but you don t care  You just like seeing cars on the road  That delightful experience of ordering a car and then watching the car pull up  it s not necessary  but it creates this level of delight that propelled Uber into the stratosphere of good user experience  Now  you have all of these other ride share applications doing exactly the same thing   Airbnb pays a lot of attention to delight  both from their product experiences for hosts and the guests  The founders of Airbnb were designers  so it makes sense  They came from RISD  That level of emotion is really important and not to be discounted  There are a lot of studies that talk about how adding that level of emotion and craft to an experience improves trust  but customers actually feel like the product works better too  When something s well crafted or adds a level of emotion  they not only trust the product  but they actually think that the product functions and works better  Rise of the DEO Adam  Speaking of designers as founders  your latest book  Rise of the DEO  Leadership by Design  is nearly 3 and 1 2 years old now but it still feels as pertinent as ever  How have design leaders changed the product landscape in the time since you ve released that book  and what might you add to the book today that you didn t previously

986,training-dataset/engineering/218.txt,engineering,Stack Overflow  A Technical DeconstructionOne of the reasons I love working at Stack Overflow is we re allowed encouraged to talk about almost anything out in the open  Except for things companies always keep private like financials and the nuclear launch codes  everything else is fair game  That s an awesome thing that we haven t taken advantage of on the technical side lately  I think it s time for an experiment in extreme openness   By sharing what we do  and I mean all of us   we better our world  Everyone that works at Stack shares at least one passion  improving life for all developers  Sharing how we do things is one of the best and biggest ways we can do that  It helps you  It helps me  It helps all of us   When I tell you how we do  something    a few things happen   You might learn something cool you didn t know about   We might learn we re doing it wrong   We ll both find a better way  together and we share that too   It helps eliminate the perception that  the big boys  always do it right  No  we screw up too   There s nothing to lose here and there s no reason to keep things to yourself unless you re afraid of being wrong  Good news  that s not a problem  We get it wrong all the time anyway  so I m not really worried about that one  Failure is always an option  The best any of us can do is live  learn  move on  and do it better next time   Here s where I need your help  I need you to tell me  what do you want to hear about  My intention is to get to a great many things  but it will take some time  What are people most interested in  How do I decide which topic to blog about next  The answer  I don t know and I can t decide  That s where you come in  Please  tell me   I put together this Trello board  Blog post queue for Stack Overflow topics  I m also embedding it here for ease  hopefully this adds a lot of concreteness to the adventure   It s public  You can comment and vote on topics as well as suggest new topics either on the board itself or shoot me a tweet   Nick_Craver  Please  help me out by simply voting for what you want to know so I can prioritize the queue  If you see a topic and have specific questions  please comment on the card so I make sure to answer it in the post   The first post won t be vote driven  I think it has to be the architecture overview so all future references make sense  After that  I ll go down the board and blog the highest voted topic each time   I ve missed blogging due to spending my nights entirely in open source lately  I don t believe that s necessarily the best or only way for me to help developers  Having votes for topics gives me real motivation to dedicate the time to writing them up  pulling the stats  and making the pretty pictures  For that  I thank everyone participating   If you re curious about my writing style and what to expect  check out some of my previous posts   Am I crazy  Yep  probably   that s already a lot of topics  But I think it ll be fun and engaging  Let s go on this adventure together,"[986 478 538 1316 421 369 833 561 667 154 1011]"
987,training-dataset/business/58.txt,business,Bringing transparency to seed investing   On differentiation  Storytelling goes a long way in fundraising for your company  One of the biggest components of this is differentiating your product   your company from others   Differentiation is very difficult   there are so many entrepreneurs who are doing something similar to you and also so many alternatives that achieve the same results as your product   solution  Even if no one has the exact same product as you  surely if you re solving a problem  there is someone else providing a different means to the same end result  And if there isn t are you really solving a problem  So  differentiating your company well is tough   So it s important to think deeply about this  Take the time to really hammer out a clear story on why your product   company is differentiated  Here are a few areas entrepreneurs ought to think about differentiation     1  Focus on results not features  The top way I see entrepreneurs differentiating their products is via features   Our UX is easier to use than the competition  ABC product is so clunky   Or   we have DEF feature but company XYZ doesn t    Most of the time  features really don t matter  Ultimately  consumers and businesses use products as a means to an end   they want to achieve X faster or cheaper or something  It may be that your user interface makes it easier or faster to accomplish X  But  people don t care about what buttons your product has  They care about that end result  Focus your story around that   Case in point  In the late 90s  Google was something like the 7th or 8th major search engine to emerge  Their feature set was different from Yahoo s   it was just one search box with nothing else on the screen  Although UI was simple  that s not why consumers switched their searches to Google  That s just a feature  Consumers switched because they could get search results a LOT faster   orders of magnitude faster  Consumers didn t have to leave the computer to get a snack while waiting for their search results to load over their dial up modem connection   2  Your results should be 10x better than competitors or alternatives not incremental  This brings me to my next point  When entrepreneurs do focus on presenting results  I find that they often tend to be incremental improvements  In an investor s eyes  incremental improvements are not interesting  This is because incremental results are often not enough to get a consumer or a business to drop everything and make it a priority to switch from what they are already using to your product   solution   In the case of Google  their results were not just a little bit better but an order of magnitude better  E g  Altavista seemed slightly faster than Yahoo  at least to me   but when Google came along  it was a no brainer to use Google all the time   Now  sometimes  you may need reframe your story here  It s not always possible for all your numbers to be an order of magnitude better  You may need to pick a different result to differentiate on  For example  let s say you develop a new kind of airplane with less 2  less drag  This  in itself  may be a small number  But it could have an order of magnitude of effect on your gas costs for the plane or whatnot  It s important to think about what axis you want to compete on   3  You may need to differentiate your company on something other than your product  This brings me to my next point  Sometimes  it s just not possible to compete at all on any numbers being an order of magnitude better  Not all great products are an order of magnitude better  And  that s ok  But  it means that you need to differentiate on something else   You will also need to do this if you re in an industry where people can t look under the hood and believe that your results are actually better en mass  For example  lead generation  There are so many lead generation startups  I had one too    And they all say they provide awesome leads  And they all say their leads are 10x more cost effective than everyone else  How is this possible  Who is telling the truth  Probably everyone   for certain customers  specific lead generation platforms and services are better than others  But it s not possible for an investor to verify this en masse  so many investors will pass outright  because they don t believe this differentiator is true and won t be able to prove it   For businesses like these where an investor cannot actually verify your differentiator  you will need to get creative in your story  Usually  the best way to do this is to incorporate your personal story  If you have unique insights or domain experience  maybe this is what you use to differentiate your company from others  Don t use a story that your competitors can use  For example  in the lead generation industry  a story I hear all the time is about how  Martha runs a flower shop and didn t have customers  Then awesome lead gen platform ABC came in and got her customers   All of your competitors   alternatives are telling that same story  Your story should be unique to you   a story that none of your competitors or alternatives can tell   To come up with such a differentiated story  in many cases  you may want to make it about yourself or your personal insights that are unique  What is interesting about you  And why are  you  doing this lead generation business  If you can t think of anything  spend the time to think long and hard   Here s an example that a CEO gave me the other day  He s building a company in a vertical that is pretty crowded  He said   Let s take a step back   before we dive into my business  I want to tell you a bit about my life  My mom was a single mom  And I grew up poor  And I could not get into college  And everyone wrote me off as a loser  And so I had to take a job after high school to make ends meet  And  I ended up in ABC industry taking the only job I could get  From there  I did XYZ  and eventually I realized from working in this business that a  I wanted to prove myself   that I was not just this poor boy with no future  And b  that I knew more about the ABC industry than most people in the world  and here are my insights on it  And this is why I m starting this company    His story was incredibly compelling  Even though his product insights were not unique  he was able to differentiate his company from many of the other ones I ve heard pitch  because I believed he knew more than other people about this industry   4  Think about future differentiation    Once you ve established why your company   product is different  think about how you ll continue to be different  Investors call this your moat  You don t need it now   most companies are not really defensible when they first start   but investors want to know how you think about this and how you ll work towards this   Your strongest story will be about how you ll continue to keep your company ahead of the pack  For example  if you have data that feeds into your algorithms to make them stronger  then your story is about growing your data access so that you ll continue to improve your algorithms  If your story is about network effects of people on your platform  tout that story   But there are a lot of stories about improving your product that I hear from entrepreneurs that are pretty weak  Saying  for example  you ll continue to improve the user experience on your platform  while may be true and important  is NOT compelling  Investors would expect you to continue to improve the product  and any newcomers or future competitors would do the same  Your head start is likely minimal  so it s moot  Any competitor can come in and build a better product than you or play catch up with a better UI   In most cases  where you don t have network effects in your product or viral loops or whatnot   and most companies don t   you ll need to tell a story about a thesis that you have  A thesis  by definition  needs to be both compelling and arguable  In other words  a good thesis will get some people excited and passionate to join your journey but will be alienating to others  Your job isn t to get all investors to like you   your job is to find investors who believe in your vision of the world  This is hard to do  because as a fundraising entrepreneur  it s tempting to want to tell a story that everyone will like  But  I m saying you shouldn t   you should come up with a thesis that at least a few people love and most people completely disagree with   5  Don t differentiate on price  Lastly  don t try to differentiate on price  Price is icing on a cake but is not the cake itself  Your product should be differentiated in other ways  and it s nice if it s cheaper  But it shouldn t only be cheaper  That s the easiest way for another company to compete with you   Good luck   Fundraising is a nebulous process that I aim to make more

1011,training-dataset/business/0.txt,business,Policy for Growth and InnovationI get asked fairly often now by people in the US government what policy changes I would make to  fix innovation and drive economic growth   1  2   for some reason  it s almost always that exact phrase    Innovation is obviously important the US has long been the world s best exporter of new ideas  and it d be disastrously bad if that were no longer the case  Also  I don t think our society will work very well without economic growth  and innovation is what will drive growth from where we are now  While it s true that people are better off in absolute sense than they were a few hundred years ago  most of us are more sensitive to our wealth increasing over short time scales  i e  life getting better every year  than how fortunate we are relative to people who lived a long time ago   3  Democracy works well in a society with lots of growth  but not a no growth  i e  zero sum  society  Very low growth and a democracy are a very bad combination   So here is my answer   1  Fix education  We have to fix education in this country  Yes  it will take a long time to have an effect on output  but that s not an excuse for continuing not to take serious action  We currently spend about 4  of the federal budget on education  The problems with education are well documented teachers make far too little  it s too difficult to fire bad teachers  some cultures don t value education  etc  Many of these are easy to fix pay teachers a lot more in exchange for a change in the tenure rules  for example and some issues  like cultural ones  are probably going to be very difficult to fix   Without good education  including continuing education and re training for older people   we will never have equality of opportunity  And we will never have enough innovators   I think it s most important to fix the broken parts of the current system  but also to decide we need to spend more money on education   One bright spot is that most of the world now has Internet access at least some of the time and there are truly remarkable resources available online to learn pretty much anything anyone could want  It amazes me that I can become relatively proficient on any subject I want  for free  from a  50 smartphone nearly anywhere in the world  There is probably a way to combine online education with real world mentorship  activity  and group interaction in a way that makes the cost of quality education far lower than it is today   Spending money on education  unlike most government spending  actually has an ROI every dollar we spend on it ought to return more dollars in the future  This is the sort of budget item that people should be able to agree on  As I wrote in the above linked post  we will likely need both entitlement spending reductions and revenue increases to make the budget work   2  Invest in basic research and development  Government spending on R D keeps decreasing  There are certain things that companies are really good at doing  basic research is usually not one of them  If the government wants more innovation  then it should stop cutting the amount of money it spends producing it  I think current policy is off by something like an order of magnitude here   Like education  this is in the category of an  investment   not an  expense    3  Reform immigration  If talented people want to come start companies or develop new technologies in the US  we should let them  Turning them away willfully sending promising new companies to other countries seems terribly shortsighted  This will have an immediate positive effect on innovation and GDP growth  Aside from the obvious and well documented economic benefits  for high skilled workers especially  but for immigration more generally   it s a matter of justice I don t think I deserve special rights because I happened to be born here  and I think it s unfair to discriminate on country of birth  Other than Native Americans  all of our families are fairly recent immigrants   We need reasonable limits  of course  but our current limits are not the answer  On our current path  in the not very distant future  we will be begging the people we are currently turning away to come and create value in the US   Many people say we don t need immigration reform because people can work remotely  While remote working works well for a lot of companies  and I expect it to continue to work better as time goes on  it doesn t work well for all companies  for example  it would not work for YC   and it shouldn t be the only option  It also sends money and competency out of our economy  The common answer of  let the US companies open overseas offices  always sounds to me like  further slow US economic growth and long term viability    Companies in the Bay Area already largely hire from elsewhere in country companies are desperate for talented people  and there aren t enough here to go around  Even with this  tech wages keep going up  and good people who already live in the Bay Area keep getting jobs   4  Cheaper housing  This is not a problem everywhere in the US  but it is in a lot of places  The cost of housing in SF and the Bay Area in general is horrific  There just isn t enough housing here  and so it s really expensive  obviously  many people make the rational decision not to live here   Expensive housing drives up the cost of everything else  and a lower cost of living gives people more flexibility  which will hopefully lead to more innovation  and more disposable income  which will hopefully stimulate economic growth    Homeowners generally vote and want to preserve their property value  non homeowners generally vote less often  So efforts to build more housing  or make housing less attractive as an investment  usually fail when they go to a vote  For example  a recent proposal to allow more house building in SF failed with an atrociously low voter turnout   In general  I think policy should discourage speculation on real estate and encourage housing to be as inexpensive as possible  I think most people would do better owning assets that drive growth anyway   In the Bay Area specifically  I think policy should target an aggressive increase in the housing supply in the next 5 years and undo many of the regulations currently preventing this   5  Reduce regulation  I think some regulation is a good thing  In certain areas  like development of AI  I d like to see a lot more of it  But I think it often goes too far for example  an average of  2 5B and 10 years to bring a new drug to market strikes me as problematic   Many of the companies I know that are innovating in the physical world struggle with regulatory challenges  And they re starting to leave  The biggest problem  usually  is that they just can t get clarity out of the massive and slow government bureaucracy  In 2014  4 companies that I work with chose to at least partially leave the US for more friendly regulatory environments  3 for regulatory violation or uncertainty  and 1 for concern about export restrictions   Many more kept their headquarters here but chose somewhere else as their initial market  including  for example  nearly all medical device companies  but also drone companies  nuclear fission companies  pharmaceutical companies  bitcoin companies  etc etc etc    This is not good  We live in a global society now  and not all countries are as backward about immigration as we are  If our best and brightest want to go start companies elsewhere  they will do so   4   I think one interesting way to solve this would be with incentives  Right now  as I understand it  regulators mostly get  career advancement  by saying  no  to things  Though it would take a lot of careful thought  it might produce good results if regulators were compensated with some version of equity in what they regulate   Again  I think some regulation is definitely good  But the current situation is stifling innovation   6  Make being a public company not be so terrible  This point is related to the one above  I d hate to run a public company  Public companies end up with a bunch of short term stockholders who simultaneously criticize you for missing earnings by a penny this quarter and not making enough long term investments   Most companies stop innovating when they go public  because they need very predictable revenue and expenses   In an ideal world  CEOs would ignore this sort of pressure and make long term bets  But the inanity on CNBC is distracting in all sorts of ways for example  it s always surprising to me how much employees react to what they hear about their company on the news   I ve seen CEOs do the wrong thing because they were scared of how  the market might react  if they do the right thing  It s a rare CEO  such as Zuckerberg  Page  Cook  and Bezos  who can stand up to public market investors and make the sort of bets that will produce long term innovation and growth at the expense of short term profits   There are a lot of changes I d make to improve the situation  One easy one is that I d pay public company directors in all stock and not let them sell it for 5 years  That will produce a focus on real growth  in the current situation  making  200k a year for four days of work leads to directors focusing on preserving their own jobs    Another is that I d encourage exchanges that don t trade every millisecond  Liquidity is a good thing  I personally don t see the value in the level of  fluidity  that we have  It s distracting to the companies and sucks up an enormous amount of human attention  one of the things I like about investing in startups is that I only have to think about the price once every 18 months or so   If I had to take a company public  I d love to only have my shares priced and traded once every month of quarter   A third change would be something to incent people to hold shares for long periods of time  One way to do this would be charge a decent sized fee on every share traded  and have the fee go to the company   another would be a graduated tax rate that goes from something like 80  for day trades down to 10  for shares held for 5 years   Another thing the government could do is just make it much easier to stay private for a long time  though this would have undesirable side effects  especially around increasing wealth inequality    7  Target a real GDP growth rate  You build what you measure  If the government wants more growth  set a target and focus everyone on hitting it   GDP is not a perfect metric  especially as the software revolution drives cost of goods gets driven lower and lower  What we really need is a measurement of  total quality of life   This will be tough to figure out  but it s probably worth the time to invent some framework and then measure ourselves against it  There are obviously a lot of other policy changes I think we should make  but on the topics of growth and innovation  these 7 points are what I think are most important  And I m confident that if we don t take action here  we are going to regret it                      1  Incidentally  innovation does not always drive job growth  even when it drives GDP growth  The industrial revolution was something of an anomaly in this regard  I ll write more about what this means later    2  There are a bunch of other policy changes I would make for example  I d increase the minimum wage to something like  15 an hour that are important and somewhat related to this goal but not directly related enough to include here    3  While access to knowledge  healthcare  food  water  etc  for people in developed countries is far better now than any time in history  extreme inequality still feels unfair  I ll save my social rant for another time  but I think the level of extreme poverty that still exists in the world is absolutely atrocious  Traveling around the

1025,training-dataset/business/430.txt,business,The CEO of Buffer on Culture  Competition  and TransparencyThe CEO of Buffer on Culture  Competition  and Transparency  Image Credit  LifeHacker  Joel Gascoigne is the CEO of Buffer  a social media management tool for individuals  marketers  and agencies  Aside from the company s much loved product  Buffer is known for maintaining one of the best marketing blogs on the web  as well as being one of the most radically transparent companies you ll stumble upon today   period  All of the company s code  revenue  and team salary information is made available to the public  No joke   Who is the cofounder behind one of the most admired tech companies around  Buffer receives 1 500 2 000 job applications per month   Joel joined Product Hunt for a LIVE Chat recently and shared some of his insights about building company culture  transparency  and leadership  among other things  Below are highlights from Joel s LIVE Chat with the community  you can check out the Full Q A on Product Hunt   Year after year  you guys have always delivered top notch content and when everyone thought you had reached the limit of your transparency strategy  you managed to take it one step further  What s your secret  How do you keep challenging yourselves    In s Silva  I think the key is to remember that you can change everything  As we grow  it can be harder to remember that  but it s always true  Earlier this year  we fully embraced experimenting with self management  and then it didn t quite work out as we expected  We were completely transparent about it  and it was hard to come back and say   We re moving away from some of those ideas   but I think that s the key to continuing to grow  It reminds me of this quote from Jeff Bezos  which is kind of ironic since you asked me about consistency   People who are right a lot of the time  are people who often change their mind  Consistency of thought is not a particularly positive trait    How did you come up with the idea of implementing such a culture in the early days of Buffer  How do you help the employees at Buffer understand the culture    Adhi  I didn t know what culture and values were when I started Buffer  It s something that I learned about over time  A lot of things have happened like that for me   I think there s a right time for everything  There are many books I ve read and they ve not sunk in or resonated with me  Many of those same books I read later and they became books that changed my life   When we hit around 9 or 10 people at Buffer  I started to experience first hand the impact of team dynamics  It was only then that I started to learn about company culture and tried to read as much as I could and watch presentations about it  By that point  a few parts of the culture had started to become clear  transparency  a focus on self improvement  etc  But we hadn t put this in to words  It was right around then that I watched an interview that Tony Hsieh from Zappos did  I can t remember exactly which one it was  but he was asked by the interviewer   If you could go back and start Zappos again  what would you do differently   Hsieh said that they had waited until they were more than 100 people before they put values into words and documented their company culture  If he were to start again  he d do that from day one  Zappos was the key company we looked up to for having such a strong company culture  so we had no choice  we had to put our values into words as soon as possible  After we did so  it really moved us from the company culture being ad hoc and left to fate  to us deliberately shaping it   How would you spend your time if you had one hour to solve a user problem need    Junius  My key focus would be on fully understanding the problem need  I think a lot of us as entrepreneurs jump straight to the solution  It s hard to actually go out there and ask about the problems people have  and stay focused on the problem rather than jumping to solutions  As soon as you jump to a solution  you re making assumptions  That s why my focus would be on customer development  on asking as much about the problem as I can without getting to the solution  Ideally  you want to understand the user s problems so well that the solution presents itself  This is really difficult  I m not that great at it  and that s why within Buffer we ve made it a key focus and have several people on the team full time working on customer development   I would love to hear how you treat the competitive threat of Hootsuite and how you plan to dominate the market in the coming years    Harry Stebbings  I know Ryan  Holmes  founder and CEO of Hootsuite  personally and think everything he s doing is incredible and inspiring  I think the key is to stay super focused on the user and the customer  We re trying our best to do that  to understand what they need   The funny thing about competition  especially for startups  is that it often isn t the thing that will kill you  I really love this old article from Zoho  Companies Don t Get Killed by Competition  They Commit Suicide   and really believe it  Especially in the early days  and we fell into this ourselves  I hear a lot of startup founders coming to me and telling me about this other startup that is also building something similar  But none of it matters   in reality  the problem both startups have is that most people don t know about either of them  Competition can help to shine light on the market  which is often actually more useful than if you were alone   What s been the biggest challenge balancing a positive culture and necessary critical feedback    Andrew So  I think that itself has been the biggest challenge  to balance the positivity value with being truly honest and giving appropriate feedback  I think for me it comes down to the difference between complaining criticizing and being honest with necessary feedback  There s a quote from Eckharte Tolle s A New Earth that helped me to find the line between these things    Complaining is not to be confused with informing someone of a mistake or deficiency so that it can be put right  and to refrain from complaining doesn t necessarily mean putting up with bad quality or behavior  There s no ego in telling the waiter that your soup is cold and needs to be heated up  if you stick to the facts  which are always neutral   How dare you serve me cold soup     that s complaining  There s a  me  here that loves to feel personally offended by the cold soup and is going to make the most of it  A  me  that enjoys making someone wrong  The complaining we are talking about is in the service of the ego  not of change    What surprises you about the experience of leading a successful startup team    Amanda Tessier  I think one surprise is how big we can grow and still need to grow more  We re 70 people now and if you d told me a few years ago we d be that many people  I would have dismissed it  Every single person on the team is awesome and completely necessary   and not only that  but we have another 20  open  roles and we re looking for people to join us to help us do better  Another surprise is how necessary structure is when you grow beyond a certain point  and how hard it is to get structure right  We ve tried a lot of different things and we keep going with our efforts there   If I m not mistaken  before you started Buffer  you were a freelancer with several clients  How did you manage your time to do freelancing while working on the early stage of Buffer    Wilbert Liu  That s absolutely right  When I started Buffer  I was working full time for several clients and I was building Buffer on the side  Here are a few key things I did   I originally was working on Buffer in my evenings  I found over time that it was not too effective  I was often tired at the end of the day  So  I switched to sleeping early  rising early and then working on Buffer for several hours before doing client work  It was much  much better and I think might be one of the keys to me actually getting Buffer off the ground   When I was a freelancer  I had many friends who were also freelancers or had their own agencies  I saw that path could work for me  The hard part is  when you re doing a startup you don t see progress as fast as if you have a service business  There s a period of learning and trying and failing  That time was tough for me  but the key was that I decided I wanted to try to make a startup work  I sought out freelance opportunities that would make it easy for me to drop freelancing once I had made something work  without disappointing clients  A key part of that was doing work for other agencies  to help them when they had too much work   I was lucky enough to end up with a setup where in the first few months of Buffer  as it started to work  I could gradually slow down my freelance work and transition over   What are some unexpected benefits of tracking your metrics so closely and transparently    Kingsong Chen  A key one is that we ve opened ourselves up to getting incredible advice from people  People have literally written 2 000 word critiques on our salary formula  or on how we do product  or being a distributed team  It s super valuable and holds us to a higher standard   What will be some of the aspects you re looking to focus on for the new year to further drive the transparency  culture and product at Buffer    Andy Yeo  We re still figuring out OKRs and accountability  I m excited about the steps we re making there  I think in terms of transparency  two areas come to mind that we could improve a lot  our product roadmap  and our hiring process  Those are key areas that I think we re less transparent than we d like to be  In terms of culture  we ve noticed that as we ve doubled in size in less than half a year  some of the focuses we ve had have become harder to keep up  One example would be our focus on self improvement  which has slipped away slightly as a core thing  In terms of product  a big one will be to launch Respond  of course  https   buffer com respond  Alongside that  we want to keep innovating with our microbusiness   individual Buffer product  free and awesome plan   as well as really building out a solid solution for the medium large business segment with Buffer for Business   What s your average weekday like    Geoffrey Weg  These days  I generally have a lot of quick meetings with different people on the team  I m mainly focused on product engineering  customer service  hiring  and then on the higher level  My calendar is open to people on the team  and it generally gets quite booked up  I have quick 20 minute sessions to give advice on a specific challenge  I also have 1 1s with several people in the team  and so I usually have one of those each day too   Other than work  I try to exercise several times a week  too  either strength training at the gym  running  or doing a bodyweight workout at an outdoor gym    What s something you used to fervently believe that you now see as fundamentally misguided    Erik Torenberg  About nine months ago when we were right in the middle of our focus on being self managed  I truly believed that leadership  management  and coaching were not required in organizations  I ve learned how very wrong I am  I still strive for us to create a unique company structure in Buffer and to challenge the traditional structures  but I ve come to believe that people need guidance based on their experience level and stage within the company  and we lost a lot when we didn t have that focus,"[1025 1073 1174 421 125 511 684 51 561 1316 1311]"
1037,training-dataset/business/273.txt,business,We re F cked  It s Over  Or Is It    The Mission   MediumWe re F cked  It s Over  Or Is It   It had been a long day at London s Google Campus  I was hungry  Before picking up a rented bike  I opened my own app and asked my neighbors at the apartment block what was cooking  I chose homemade macaroni and cheese from the guy on the floor above  I chipped in  6 and started pedaling  It had taken two years of relentless work to create this experience   The app  Cookisto  was finally close to perfect   I should have been flying but I wasn t   I was stressed  Deeply stressed   The numbers I d been crunching all day were telling me something I didn t want to hear  Cookisto should have been flying but it wasn t  Suddenly that extra floor and a few polite words to get my food were a hassle   I d thought I understood what it meant to  be your customer  but it takes more than that  You must  be your brutally honest customer    You either build a product where you meet your neighbors and socialize or a product that offers you great food  All I wanted from the very beginning was great food  delivered fast  Nothing else   As I sat there eating  it was good  I realized this was the last supper for Cookisto  This phrase from Ben Horowitz s book The Hard Thing About Hard Things was on repeat in my head    We re F cked  It s Over   WFIO    How had it come to this   First things first  My name is Michalis  I m 29 and I m a terrible cook  This is not something I m proud of  There was good food around me growing up in Athens  Greece and thanks to my family s commitment to my education I got to study in the U S   in France and in China  This taught me plenty about eating but somehow it didn t improve my cooking   This has been a pain point for me every day since I was a teenager  I love good food and I value healthy eating and the existing takeaway options just don t deliver on either of these   They re either expensive  like high end restaurants  or the unhealthy classics  such as pizza  burgers and fast food   I believe that this is a problem that technology and innovation can and will fix   The sharing economy was getting into full swing as I embarked on my Masters program in Global Entrepreneurship and these thoughts fused into an idea  which became my thesis and then morphed into a startup   The idea was simple  the first peer to peer marketplace for home cooked meals  Welcome to Cookisto   In Athens we were surrounded by neighborhoods of passionate cooks and armies of hungry people who value homemade food but don t have the time or the talent to cook it themselves  By matching the two we could enable home cooks to make some extra cash  while enabling foodies to enjoy home cooking at affordable prices  Cookisto would show you what was cooking near you  help you place the order and enjoy a real homemade meal   I needed a co founder and Petros was the standout choice  A childhood friend  just returned from Paris  intent on continuing his family s successful tradition in the restaurant business  Here was a great cook  obsessed with discovering new flavors and experimenting with ingredients  And he was ready to properly commit  He joined Cookisto  even though it meant leaving his first bar restaurant behind   It was the fall of 2013  we had  10k  an idea and a name   Dawn of the Cookisto Era  From the outset the idea of Cookisto excited people and we found we could drive interest from cooks and consumers through free media exposure  We boosted this momentum with offline marketing in specific neighborhoods  The goal was to create liquidity in at least in few areas in Athens  The first transactions were completed successfully and feedback was great  What a feeling   From a crazy idea inside your head  to a powerpoint  to a tech product  to a service that brought people together in the real world and offered them great homemade food  We were so hooked we were our own best customers and were meeting talented cooks all over Athens   Cookisto was the talk of the town and we secured  200k seed money from angel investors  We grew to a team of six   three engineers  one marketing person and us  the founders  We quickly decided to launch in London as well in order to learn from a more mature market   Our go to market strategy for London remained the same but cold emailing journalists didn t work like it had in Athens  We were not the only story in town  So we doubled down   We profiled relevant journalists and tailored our message  We thought through different angles  young Greek entrepreneurs in London during the Greek crisis  startups and youth entrepreneurship  Cookisto and the sharing economy   We made them feel special  We offered journalists the  exclusive  chance to review our service before we went live and made sure we had amazing cooks near them  The results were astonishing  During our launch we were covered by the BBC  The Independent  The Sunday Times  The Telegraph  London Evening Standard  Daily Mail  CNN  the list goes on   Media generated more media  which lead to more traffic and free users  We had 40 000  users  a few thousand cooks and more than 16 000 portions delivered  each paying us a modest cut   Cookisto Goes Cold  The honeymoon period ended with the inevitable dip in media exposure  Something we could see with through our improved efforts at cohort analysis     Reminder  We were first time entrepreneurs  No clue about authentic growth back then    Total numbers  users  orders were all growing but retention was low  The service was sexy to the media and consumers but analysis showed that most of them would only use it a few times  We acted immediately   We became experts in analytics and entered a period of hyperspeed tweaking of the product model  We skewed towards demand driven  users placing the order   then supply driven  cooks only accepting pre orders   then a hybrid  We locked many of the parameters of the marketplace to improve user experience  range of prices  times you could order etc   We made improvements but sadly they were marginal   We needed a step change  We tried building an instant supply driven model as a mobile product active only in big residential buildings  In the Cookisto app you would ask your neighbors what was cooking with one tap  they would respond via a simple text  and you would chip in with one more tap   We became pretty damn good at hyperlocal marketing  We first identified big residential buildings through Foursquare s API and then users or ourselves could trigger personalized invite postcards to all residents of that building  It worked  In my building in Elephant and Castle  for example  we had 40 Cookisto users   Me distributing flyers in big residential buildings before we automate the process   It was better but still not enough  It could be a lifestyle business but not a mass movement that changes the way we eat   We had tweaked  sprinted  reinvented our model and we were back at a dead end   Now I was deeply stressed   I was pedaling home for the last supper  And we had arrived at the  WFIO  moment   We had less than four months of runway   35k in the bank  and no business   I was experiencing another Horowitz rite of passage   The Struggle     The Struggle is when you wonder why you started the company in the first place   The Struggle is when people ask you why you don t quit and you don t know the answer   The Struggle is when your employees think you are lying and you think they may be right   The Struggle is when food loses its taste    What I was starting to see through the fog of detail and struggle was the big picture  Watching Scott Belsky s video What Are You Willing To Be Bad At  helped me focus   He argues that when launching a new business you need to start by identifying the key attributes your market values the most  Then you build a product or service that s 10x better than the competition at that key attribute  This is the only way to break existing habits  In order to get the 10x advantage you need to be willing to suck at other things   This is what Airbnb did  It didn t conquer the accommodation space because of the experience it offered or the convenience  it did it by being 10x cheaper  Some people value a unique experience  others don t  There is nothing convenient about messaging multiple hosts  waiting for a reply and wrangling about keys   Airbnb did not become a billion dollar business because you want to be friends with your host  It gained market share because it was 10x cheaper than existing options  Promoting the community aspect behind it was great marketing and a shield against regulation but irrelevant to its business success  in my opinion   At Cookisto  we d spent too much time thinking about scalability and opportunity and not enough time on the key attributes the customer valued the most  Our customers  key attributes were   1  Price 2  Convenience 3  Experience  Homemade Quality   Cookisto was a bit better on price  sucked big time at convenience and was very good in terms of experiencing a home cooked meal  We were the only place that you could actually find food cooked by your neighbor      But what was the key attribute our market valued the most  We had learned the hard way that it was convenience   Not only did this model fail to deliver on convenience  it presented business challenges to which there was no realistic solution  We were trying to deliver a niche service in a hyperlocal  peer to peer marketplace  We would always be struggling with liquidity  sufficient activity from cooks and consumers  in relative proximity  to keep both sides happy   You can try to fix the hyperlocal challenge by figuring out the logistics but only at the expense of price and that will kill you too   Pivot Under Pressure  Talking to the media  geeking out on the product  hiring  dreaming about the success of your company   this is is all cool stuff  But who is going to figure out what needs to be done now  Who is going to take the painful decisions  Who is going to inform our existing investors that Cookisto isn t going to work  Who is going to announce to the team that we have less than four months of runway and that we need to start again from scratch  Who is going to throw what we took two years to build in the trash  Things just got real  And lonely   I was a first time entrepreneur and still only 26  What I did have was two super powerful quotes that encapsulate my mentality in this situation   The first is from Sam Walton    There is only one boss  The customer  And he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman on down  simply by spending his money somewhere else    The other is Andrew Grove s question to his colleague Gordon Moore in the book Only the Paranoid Survive    If we got kicked out and the board brought in a new CEO  what do you think he would do   Moore answered without hesitation   He would get us out of memories   To which Grove responded   Why shouldn t you and I walk out the door  come back and do it ourselves    We had to move on  We had to put the customer first  Nothing else mattered  Not our egos nor our fears  It was about survival   Petros and I committed to figuring this out  We became closer  We went back to why we had started the company in the very beginning  We took all our recent learning and went to work benchmarking different models  We came up with a plan that made sense  I moved back from London and announced our decision to our investors   To begin with they were disappointed and skeptical  We gave no time to dwelling on emotion or second thoughts  We knew that this was the best decision for everyone   Relight the Fire  We then announced the news to the team and communicated the reasons behind it  We presented a draft plan and proposed a three day huddle in the countryside to finalize it   To my surprise  nobody left the team  Instead I saw them get fired up again  Everyone was super motivated  They knew that things hadn t been perfect and seeing the founders face the problem head on with a plan boosted the team s morale   We decided to bring the whole value chain of the business under our control  We were going to deliver a 10x better experience to the customer   The plan was simple yet ambitious   One month to set up a new business  rent a kitchen  hire a chef  hire motorbike drivers  create the menu  design logo  website  build mobile app for drivers  build first version of the routing algorithm plus complete all the legal and admin paperwork    One month to show traction   One month to fundraise   It was war time  For extra motivation I created a WFIO timer on my desktop so I could track how many days of cash we had left   Actual screenshot of my desktop in August 2014  It was the most productive and intense period of our lives so far   We successfully launched a new business in a month with less than  35k   Everything was on one Asana project titled   Launch Forky   It meant daily stand ups with all team members  great ownership and efficiency from everyone  Great creativity to get around obstacles that could hold us up   In the early days I joined our three motorbike drivers for deliveries  Petros was cooking with the chef  as I mentioned  he s an amazing cook   our engineers were doing customer support  Whatever it took to reach our goals  To get traction we found hacked corporate phone numbers from a database and we started cold calling every lead offering them coupons to use our service  Almost everyone was doing phone calls before the lunchtime rush   Me delivering meals  Petros cooking with our chef in our 20 sq  m  kitchen  Our goals  1 happy customer  10 happy customers  100 happy customers  1 000 happy customers  Our kitchen hit maximum capacity by August  Anyone who has spent August in Athens will know how empty the city is and how tough that is   We also managed to extend our runway a bit by living on cash flow and by getting no salaries for a few months  We raised an  800k seed round in January 2015 lead by Open Fund and BlueWire Capital  while our Cookisto investors followed up together with some of the most successful Greek entrepreneurs and angel investors   What is Forky   Forky brings you great food in minutes  Your stomach tells you you are hungry now and you don t want junk food  You go to our website or app and choose from 2 healthy meals 1 salad and few more supplementary items  You place your order in 3 taps  Your meal is in front of you in less than 15 minutes   In essence  Forky is the first truly scalable food tech company  Its DNA is food  tech and logistics  We ve developed a business model that is capital efficient and scalable without sacrificing the quality  We love talking in more detail about the backend of Forky but the recipe of its secret sauce is a conversation that has to be limited to investors       When you re eating Forky it s modern Mediterranean cuisine with a twist  Our chef creates recipes that our customers can relate to  And they make everyday food exciting by adding an element of surprise  an ingredient  a sauce or a spice inspired by another cuisine that will take the dish to a new level,"[1037 561 1316 51 154 536 1124 327 232 987 1390]"
1039,training-dataset/product/1380.txt,product,Why Writers Should Manage Your Tech Projects54 Flares 54 Flares    Product managers usually begin their career by doing something else  Interview a dozen candidates to tend to your tech product and you ll meet former coders  UX designers and marketers  You won t meet a single writer  and that s a glaring omission because I think writers make killer product managers  Let me count the ways   Reason 1  Writers Invented Empathy  If empathy is a product manager s  1 core trait  and if empathy means putting yourself into the shoes of another  then writers have Play Doh feet  which they can mold into sneakers  heels and Crocs  Writers have charted the inner world of thousands of protagonists  They can put your soul into 500 words after one conversation  When writers get bored  they assemble a person from scratch and drop that sucker into a tragedy just to see what happens  Sounds like persona writing and scenario testing to me  Hire a writer and you ll have a crisp  fully fleshed out understanding of your target audience  and team    Reason 2  Writers Read  According to the landmark tome  PeopleWare  technologists don t read very much  unless you count StackOverflow  Reddit and Quora  But give your writer six months and they ll inhale every book on product management  watch every MindTheProduct video  interview every thought leader and wear out a Moleskine journal with novel connections  Is it because your writer has much to learn and more to prove  Maybe  but reading and researching are part of their DNA  Hire a writer and you ll always stay on top of trends   Reason 3  Writers are Grandmasters of Feedback  Writers have an insane ritual where they gather in a circle and make themselves vulnerable to the cold judgement of others  They recite stories about alcoholic grandfathers and lost love  Once finished they take a deep breath and brace themselves for criticism  When it s the writer s turn to give feedback they balance the positive with the constructive  Tech professionals acknowledge the importance of feedback  but writers pay blood tribute  Hire a writer and you re hiring a skilled diplomat who doesn t want anything sugar coated   Reason 4  Writers Make Requirements Readable  Developers cry when reading user stories  That s because user stories read as boring as they sound  If your product manager is a writer  your developers will still cry  but tears of joy  Your user stories will sing with precise language and uplifting imagery  Hire a writer and your team might enjoy reading requirements   Reason 5  Writers Know How to Pivot and Kill  Writers aren t afraid to pivot or kill ideas  A writer will shelve six months of work because a book isn t working  They ll delete their favourite chapter because a trusted editor told them it sucks  They ll scrub characters and change themes on a dime  They won t flinch  Product development and product management is as much about change and death than it is about life  Hire a writer and they ll do the dirty work for you   Reason 6  Writers Add an X Factor  Even the best designed  best coded apps will limp with bad writing  Because above average writing is rare in technology  it s an inexpensive source of competitive advantage  Your writer will add an impeccable voice to a dull Sign Up page  They ll craft a clever name for your product that s rooted in Greek mythology  They ll deflect customer rage by turning your 404 Page into a punchline  Hire a writer and your product will have that little something extra   Reason 7  Writers Iterate  Writers know that true writing is rewriting  They ll see every version of your tech project as another draft  They ll recruit trusted editors and keep pushing the team to improve  Writers won t dilly dally  they understand the importance of shipping and will hit deadline  Hire a writer and they ll have absorbed cutting edge product lessons back in English   Reason 8  Writers Are Battle Hardened  Writers know how to fight for a clear vision through dull  monotonous  no end in sight repetition  A novel needs as much willpower as a tech project  The difference is that writers don t get a launch party when they cross the finish line  they re rewarded with apathy or a black eye  They take the punch  toss their manuscript into a hole and start on something else  Hire a writer and you re hiring grit   Reason 9  Writers Are a Great Value  For the price of an entry level tech worker  you can hire a writer with an Ivy League MFA or a seasoned journalist who s conquered deadlines and bludgeoned flaky freelancers  If you think that the tech industry is one big echo chamber  writers will raise your product to a unique pitch  Hire a writer and you ll create a more interesting culture with money to spare   Reason 10  Writers Are Creative  When we talk about movie directors or showrunners  we talk a lot about creativity  But for some reason when we talk about product managers  all we talk about are tools and frameworks  That s a shame because a creative leader is the best way to inspire and push a creative team  And few work harder than writers at creativity  They attend workshops  practice stream of consciousness exercises and care more about ideas than face time or rank  Hire a writer and your product will surprise your fans   and the competition   Should You Really Hire A Writer   Maybe or maybe not  who knows  The point of this article isn t that writers are some magical  untapped panacea  The point is that we shouldn t be too narrow when thinking about the  ideal  background for a product manager  Because product management is more art than science and relies on so many disparate disciplines  anyone can bring something unique and powerful to the table  A salesperson s charisma and people skills are just as effective as a coder s technical understanding or a UX designer s eye for wireframes  So next time you want to hire an entry level product manager  don t discard a resume just because there s no computer science degree or MBA attached  Give that English grad a chance,"[1039 241 1316 154 963 1041 1396 561 1327

1041,training-dataset/business/436.txt,business,Would you hire yourself That s right  would you offer yourself a job at your company  It s a question every interviewer should ask themselves   No  this isn t some theoretical mental exercise  It s actually a great question to ask yourself when you re looking to expand your team but find yourself paralyzed with options   When you are hiring for small but growing teams each additional hire has a disproportionately large impact  If your startup is still at a really early stage  a bad hire has the potential to set you back several quarters and possibly even blow up the whole company  Faced with such high stakes  it s no surprise some people struggle to make a decision   either good or bad   Asking if you would hire yourself is a great way of snapping out of it and a technique I ve used myself as a hiring manager  It s at least in part inspired by Andy Grove  the legendary Intel boss  who literally wrote the book on Silicon Valley management style   Rather than asking would he hire himself  Grove considered what would happen if he and Intel CEO Gordon Moore were fired  The new CEO would come in and quickly and unemotionally make the decision that the two experienced execs were agonizing over   to exit the memory business  which Intel was founded on  and focus on microprocessors  an emerging technology  With emotion put to one side Grove and Moore did just that and cemented Intel s place as one of the giants of the technology industry   Resetting your brain  To be totally clear this is not about pattern matching so that you end up with a team of  mini me s   Asking if you would hire yourself is not about whether you are an exact fit for the role you re trying to fill  You re not or you wouldn t be trying to recruit someone  right  But in my experience it does reset your brain and focuses you on 3 critical factors   Empathy for the candidate  Think of all the people who gave you a break or believed in you during your career  Does this person just need the same chance   Think of all the people who gave you a break or believed in you during your career  Does this person just need the same chance  Hiring for potential  As Des has pointed out before trajectory is more important than current state  Wouldn t you prefer to get someone on your team who s growing and learning  over someone who is coasting through a role they ve done many times before  Thinking about your earlier career path can really help throw this into focus   As Des has pointed out before trajectory is more important than current state  Wouldn t you prefer to get someone on your team who s growing and learning  over someone who is coasting through a role they ve done many times before  Thinking about your earlier career path can really help throw this into focus  Setting a realistic bar  This is not an excuse for lowering your standards  But what it does is make sure your bar is practical and reasonable and not set for a mythical candidate you are unlikely to ever find   The results might not be quite as dramatic as Andy Grove  firing himself  but this one simple question can help you find the right people who want to hitch their wagon to your star  While making a bad hire can set you back several months  the longer you go without hiring  the longer you re not expanding and growing at your full potential,"[1041 1316 51 561 1145 610 154 883 684 1112 680]"
1045,training-dataset/product/517.txt,product,FI co  Here s How to Find Your FirstAn amazing product is only worth producing if it can attract customers  However  for a startup that s only recently launched  finding customers can be a tricky and laborious task  And while it may be easy to assume that a great product should be able to sell itself  more often than not  founders have to go out and build their audience first   In this syndicated post  Brittany Berger  Content   PR Manager at Mention  outlines an effective approach to finding customers utilizing the power of social media   The article   How to Find Your Startup s First Customers on Social Media   originally appeared on Mention s blog  and has been republished below with permission   Your first customers are your most important ones   They re there with you from the beginning  They re the ones that see you at your worst and watch you grow   And that makes them invested  They ll often become your most loyal and vocal advocates  Because they ve been there the whole time  Like the great aunts that can t stop talking about how cute you were when you were still in diapers   It s an important role to fill for your company  You want to make sure you re filling the position with people who are worthy   The perfect customers   But if you want perfection  you can t wait for it to come to you  You have to go out and find them   And you can do it with listening on social media   Social listening is easy  it s quick  and it should definitely be one of the first things you add to yourcustomer engagement strategy  There s no better way to see what s going on in the market  find your value  and meet the people that will keep you in business   Here are just a few ways to identify and engage with people to turn them into customers   1  Monitor conversations on Twitter  You can easily find people talking about   People looking for product and service recommendations  People discussing your industry  People talking about your competitors   You can make it really easy for yourself and set up alerts and saved searches to track all of those conversations relevant to your startup   For example  in my case I monitor keywords like  social media tools  and  media monitoring  to keep a pulse on Mention s niche   So identify keywords that will lead you to the important conversations  and when you re ready  jump in   Now  when you find people looking for recommendations  it s an invitation to be salesy on social for once  Normally on social media  jumping into a conversation and promoting your project is a huge no no   But if you re answering someone s question  and the answer just happens to be your company  that s providing you both with value  Win win   When joining conversations discussing the industry  you can t be as promotional  Go in with the goal to help your community members  not to pimp your product  Don t mention it until the topic actually comes up  if it does   And if it doesn t  that s fine  You ve made a contact   that can be long lasting  Who s to say it won t come up in a later conversation   And for conversations about competitors  just read on   2  Find your competitor s unhappy customers  Another great lead generation opportunity is to monitor your competitors  But you can take it even further by drilling down their mentions to focus on people who may be open to switching   A competitor s unhappy customer is a hot lead for your company   Someone complaining about your competitor is a great opportunity to lend an ear  offer support  and objectively let them know what alternatives are out there  After a bit more conversation  it could become a poaching opportunity as well   Use advanced settings and sentiment analysis in your social listening tool to find unhappy customers   Sentiment analysis can filter by tone so you can pick out the negative mentions of your competitor   And in advanced settings  you can also set  and  keywords to add in words or phrases that signal unhappiness  like  sucks    hate    doesn t work   etc  Those will help you find their customers that are probably pretty open to learning about alternatives   For example  Close io found one social mention that turned into over  500 month   Through monitoring their competitors and looking for unhappy customers  they found someone complaining about a competitor s lack of a certain feature  Something that Close io did offer  That was the perfect opportunity for Close io to start a conversation   Again  context is everything  You can t always be so salesy  but there will be times when all the stars line up and you have an open invitation to promote  Listening will help you find those opportunities   3  Be present in forums  Participating in industry and niche forums is another great way to build relationships and advocates  and get some customers along the way   But industry websites  along with niche sections on sites like Quora and Reddit  can be hard to find if you don t already know about them  So where does that leave new startups   If your media monitoring tool brings in conversations from forums  you can use that to figure out where your audience is hanging out  If I m monitoring  Mention  or  social media software  and that term s used in a thread on Reddit  I ll see it   For example  one entrepreneur posted his crowdfunding story on several different subreddits  and all of the threads had active conversations going on   Being able to jump in built connections with other readers and we were able to answer some questions raised  helping people out   It s also helped me identify which subreddits to keep an eye on  based on where people are already talking about us   Look out for discussions where you can chime in to build relationships  And once again  you ll often find people asking for company recommendations  where it wouldn t be inappropriate to promote your own company  But other than that  focus on having helpful conversations  not selling   4  Join social communities  There re also private communities on sites like Facebook  LinkedIn  Google   and Slack   The best way to get leverage out of these groups is simply by being active  participating in conversations  and being friendly and helpful   This will enlist the group s other members into your brand s community  Community members become great customers  and will be some of your best friends in the meantime   And if there does come a time when a conversation about your product comes up  you ll be really glad you re a member   That was the case when I found this message in one of my favorite Slack communities  from someone who s now a happy customer   And one of the best way to gain new customers from communities like these   Simply ask for feedback  In the early days  you ll be clamoring for it anyway  If it s not against a community s guidelines  post about your product in a way that s not promotional  but humble  Ask for advice  and really listen  If you implement the community s suggestions  they have no reason to stop being a customer   5  Participate in online events  AMAs  Q   As  Webinars  Twitter chats  Podcasts  Online networking events   These are all opportunities to put yourself out there   In monitoring your industry  you ll find out about online events pretty easily   If you can t already tell  monitoring makes a lot of things easy    And online events are great for building really close relationships with your community  Something about the live aspect  it makes it more personal and a little closer to the connection you get communicating face to face   The great news  Online events usually occur regularly   sometimes as often as weekly   so the hosts are usually pretty welcoming to pitching yourself as a possible guest   Make it about them for long term relationships  Did you notice an overarching theme of this post  Yup  I mentioned quite a few times how important it is not to promote yourself unless the situation basically begs you to   Social media is about building relationships   gaining customers is a secondary benefit  Social friends become customers  advocates  maybe even future employees  But only when you build a relationship around helping them   Brittany Berger is the Content   PR Manager at Mention  where she reads a lot and writes

1056,training-dataset/business/1273.txt,business,How Being a Female Tech Founder is DifferentNo one can argue that the entrepreneurial ranks have been historically populated by men  Therefore  as Rebekah Campbell describes from her personal experiences  being a woman in this endeavor can be very different and more challenging  Fortunately  as she says   there are advantages in being a female technology entrepreneur  that make success very attainable   Rebekah Campbell is the Co Founder and CEO of Hey You App  Australia s largest technology application for cafes and quick service restaurants  She has also served as a Mentor for the Sydney Founder Institute   Below  Rebekah breaks down the differences for women starting their own technology companies based on her own personal story  How Being a Female Tech Founder is Different originally appeared on Rebekah Campbell s Blog  It has been republished with permission        Just over three years ago I started a company called Posse  a business idea that required technology   I never thought I was doing anything extraordinary  and was shocked to learn that only 3  of Australians who launch technology companies are women  I d started businesses in other fields and gender was never an issue  Now  after three years at Posse  I have to admit it  being a female tech entrepreneur is different   Sheryl Sandberg told the striking story of a Harvard Business School experiment in her book  Lean In   Two identical resumes  one for an entrepreneur named Howard and the other Heidi were shown to students  Both ranked as equally competent but significantly more people wanted to work with Hank  I ve pitched to hundreds of investors around the world and can pinpoint times when a great meeting didn t lead to an investment  I ve wondered  would it have been different if I d been a man  I suspect the answer would sometimes be yes   particularly in the US  But without performing a gender change  winding back time  and conducting the same discussion as a man  it s hard to say  I m no expert in how different genders fare in business   I can only share my experience of life in this crazy tech startup world and some of the disadvantages and advantages of being a woman on the journey   I never thought I was doing anything extraordinary  and was shocked to learn that only 3  of Australians who launch technology companies are women    In early 2010 I was invited to speak to a group of Angel Investors at a fancy dinner in Sydney  It was my first big opportunity to raise investment and I was nervous  I d practised my pitch for days  arrived early at the venue and darted up the stairs  A shriek rang out from reception   Come back   The porter explained that this was a gentlemen s club  to reach the event at which I was pitching  I couldn t use the stairs  As a  lady   I had to take the elevator  The guests began to arrive  and as the room filled up I felt uneasy  Something odd was in the air  but what  Then I noticed  In a room of sixty investors I saw no other woman  I m not easily intimidated but this threw me  now I was uncomfortable  At last  one female investor showed  we made eye contact and I felt relieved  She remains a mentor today   My first year as a tech founder was lonely  for my friends couldn t relate to my challenges  I encountered many new people  particularly as I raised investment  All were men  mainly in their 50s and 60s  Their advice was great  but the softer emotional support was missing  I suspect that male founders have quite different relationships with their investors  Maybe they re invited to golf and the pub   that s different for women  Now  we have more than 50 investors in Posse and every one is male  I ve developed great friendships with many  and have formed a close group with a few other female tech entrepreneurs in Sydney  so I m happy to report that I m not lonely anymore  But it all took time   The emotional roller coaster of running a tech company is a challenge  one that I handle differently from my male counterparts  Again this is just self perception  other women may have different experiences  Naturally  I push myself hard  I m responsible for other people s money  Early  when I was finding my feet  I d work around the clock and made a few mistakes  For a while  I had an unfriendly board who hammered me close to breaking point  I ve seen guys in this situation and they fight back  becoming angry  it s their natural reaction and is expected  I m not wired like that  I can become upset and that s my way of releasing stress  but I soon learned this was unacceptable in a business setting   As a woman  I think I bring different skills to a technology business  Most of our team are software engineers  They re all male  and I ve discovered the way I think and make decisions differs from theirs  I m more people focused and instinctual  I talk to customers  using this information to decide what they value about our product and what needs to be changed  When I present my findings to the engineers I have difficulty convincing them my research is valid  They want numbers  I believe that great start ups are a combination of customer based intuitive vision  and the ingenious application of metrics to engineer a good user experience  I ve learned that to win over engineers I must back up my assumptions with data  It s a powerful discipline  for in combining the strength of both approaches we design much better products   I ve seen guys in this situation and they fight back  becoming angry  it s their natural reaction and is expected  I m not wired like that  I can become upset and that s my way of releasing stress  but I soon learned this was unacceptable in a business setting   Rebekah Campbell  There are advantages in being a female technology entrepreneur  I m the exception  so I suspect my business and I both receive more exposure than if I d been a man  I m frequently invited to speak at tech events and often I m the only woman on the bill  I suspect that organisers sometimes make a last gasp discovery  we don t have any women  Other founders sometimes ask   how do you get so much media   I have to admit  being a chick helps  And  let it be whispered  business editors want their quota of photographs and stories about women  With only a handful of us out there  we probably get more opportunities   Overall  the positives of being a woman may balance the negatives in this male dominated industry  I m passionate about our business and love every minute of what I do   even when times are tough  Being unusual can be lonely but it can be awesome  I raised  300K that night at the gentlemen s club where I was one of only two women in the room  and went on to raise another million or so through their contacts  Being a woman might have helped me  I m sure it made me stand out   We must inspire more women to launch technology focused businesses  raising the profile of female entrepreneurs  Then younger girls may view technology as an attractive career option  with more women drawn into early stage investment  I hope I can be part of that next wave  It matters  Why  Because the entire industry will be enriched by our customer based intuitive vision   That s why    Young confident woman in red cape and mask image by Shutterstock,"[1056 560 1266 131 284 51 878 1316

1062,training-dataset/product/1280.txt,product,How a Facebook designer overcame imposter syndromeHere s what I know   Going through a life altering international move is hard  Starting fresh in a new city without any real ties is really hard  Accepting your first big girl job you re not sure you re qualified for is almost unimaginable   Going to this new  shiny job every day and feeling as though you don t have a support system of people who really get you and will catch you when you inevitably trip and fall that s nearly impossible   Wait  so  how did you get here   I joined Facebook in March of 2015 off the heels of the public acquisition of Teehan Lax  After 5 years in Toronto  I accepted the offer to join the Facebook Design team  and I picked up and moved to the Bay Area all in the course of 6 weeks   I d had a cumulative 2 months at T L  Before this  I took an 8 week front end development course at HackerYou  HackerYou provided the front end coding chops I d always wanted  but I never gave myself the time to learn them  In 2 months  I learned HTML  CSS  Javascript  and responsive design  I was new  Not fresh out of 4 years of interaction design school new  but I didn t know Facebook design was a thing until the acquisition kind of new   You could say I was green  and you d be right   Facebook took a huge chance for me  and I was excited to take a giant leap for them   Related  How to overcome imposter syndrome  The Conscious Competence Ladder  And joining Facebook was everything I could have asked for  terrifying  challenging  and completely humbling  My first  aha  moment came around the 4 month mark when my manager at the time spoke to me about the The Conscious Competence Ladder  According to this model  we move through the following levels as we build competence in a new skill   Unconscious Incompetence  You are unaware of the skill and your lack of proficiency Conscious Incompetence  You are aware of the skill and your lack of proficiency Consciously Competence  You are able to use that skill  but only with effort Unconscious Competence  Performing the skill becomes automatic  I had no idea what I d gotten myself into  I didn t know enough to realize how little I knew   See   unconscious incompetence  above   I d been sleepwalking through my day to day  doing what I was told  and saying what was expected  I was not myself but rather what others wanted  Survival mode had kicked in and I was attempting to simply blend in with the pack   Oh  so that s what rock bottom is  You re thinking this is where I turned the corner and rallied  right  I love the optimism  but that s not how this story goes   After realizing how in over my head I truly was  I fell into a pretty big tailspin into paralyzing self doubt followed by a wicked case of debilitating imposter syndrome  The kicker  I was on a team with incredibly experienced  charismatic male designers      For what it s worth  I realize this topic is not without its controversy  I don t mean to claim that all women feel all the feelings and all men do not this is one woman s experience  One that happens to have a lot of feelings  all the time    This wasn t the kind hearted group of single mothers I was raised by these guys had back to back meetings  influence  and no clue about the paralyzing fear I was experiencing  I missed my support network and I needed to find a new tribe   So here s the punchline  yes  I found a handful of folks I felt I could be my full  uncensored self with  and I will always be grateful to them  But that s not what fished me out of this slump   I hit rock bottom 9 months after my start date during a trip home where I was convinced I d done the wrong thing  that I shouldn t go back to the Bay Area  I d moved there to work  and I felt I was failing completely at even fulfilling the basic requirements of my job   I was a shell of my outspoken self in meetings  I didn t know what I could possibly have to contribute in a room full of PhDs and decades of experience  My opportunities to shine felt few and far between  and I left work feeling like I d underperformed just a little more than the previous day  I perfected the art of the Shuttle Cry  trademark pending    And then a switch flipped   This journey was no one else s but mine  No one was going to pull me out  and I had to stop waiting  It wasn t up to my mentor  my manager  or my handful of new friends to fix this for me  I did not want to be the damsel in distress of this story  I wanted to be the Oprah  the Sheryl Sandberg the one who figures it out on her own  and owes it to no one but her own gumption and tenacity   Surrender  it turns out  is what growing up feels like  I stopped asking permission and waiting for someone to notice how I was feeling after all  no one knew that better than I did   I adjusted my expectations of myself  and found new examples of what I wanted my career to look like  I found strong examples of designers with similar strengths  I sought mentorship from senior women at Facebook  I asked for what I wanted   Where do I go from here  I had a real conversation with my manager  Not a fluffy  friendly one like I was used to  This was planned  and it was real and honest  It was raw  I mustered confidence from the comfort of home  consulted my troops  and come up with a set of questions  shout out to my dad  Brendan Howley  for this    The questions I asked looked something like this   What do I want   What steps can we take to attach me to a project so that   I m engaged in work that is not only visible  but visible in my favor I am not only productive  but seen as being productive  What do I need from my manager   What can we work on together to make sure that I see these things in my career   Real change in my role and or responsibilities Personal growth My coworkers empower me  and I empower my coworkers in return  What are our next steps   How do we collaborate on a plan that everyone agrees has a high probability of success   When not clearly stated in black and white as it is above  it sounded a lot like   This is what I want  and this is how I think we should work together to fix it    This is how I got what I wanted and brought my manager onside  It showed I d worked to identify my problem  and a potential solution  In my case  it meant a move within the company   Another leap  I made a move to a new team one that happened to be primarily composed of women  It was scrappy  small  and off the radar it was risky  I was ready and willing to work hard and boy did I ever  I took every ounce of responsibility they gave me  and 2 months later we launched a product called Account Kit at F8  Facebook s annual developer conference   You could call it something like a comeback   I took a risk moving to a new country to do work I d never done before  on a scale I couldn t imagine  I felt like an imposter  doubted my abilities  and felt completely unequipped going into each work day   But I reminded myself that the only way through was to trust myself and take responsibility for my own success   Despite some turbulence upon take off  I now go into work every day and feel empowered  respected  and understood by my team  Facebook gave me the platform  the time  and most importantly the opportunity to find what made me  me and what I needed to kick ass  I couldn t be prouder to call myself a Facebook Product Designer  It s only the beginning  but now I have a strategy to handle what comes next   Take that  Oprah   Thank you to those who heard me out  and helped

Principal Marketing Manager at HubSpot  A few months ago  we deliberately unsubscribed 250 000 people from HubSpot s Marketing Blog   people who had opted in to receive emails about new content we published on the blog  This subscriber purge brought our total subscriber count from 550 000 down to 300 000   We re crazy  right  We must be crazy  We re the same people who just recently blogged about how important growing subscribers is to increasing blog traffic  What gives   Graymail  Graymail is what gives    Graymail  What s Graymail   Graymail is email you technically opted in to receive but don t really want   Graymail is kind of like spam s risk taking but law abiding cousin   It s not against the law like spam is  but it s also not as pure as spam s straight edged cousin  ham   which is apparently what they call email that people actually want to receive   I guess that s why some people call graymail  bacn   bacon   Email deliverability experts can be so clever  huh   Here s an example  Let s say you signed up for an ecommerce website s email list because doing so got you a 15  off coupon for a fishing pole you bought for your brother as a birthday gift  But you re not into fishing yourself  and now you re getting emails from them that don t interest you   That s one type of graymail  It s not considered spam because you signed up for it  but you re still not likely to engage with it   Why Graymail Hurts Marketers  Although it s not considered spam  sending graymail is problematic because it can hurt the deliverability of your email overall  Tipped off by low engagement rates  email clients may deliver email from known graymail senders straight to recipients   junk  folders   even for brand new subscribers who haven t even had the chance to engage with your email  In other words  the email technically gets sent  and delivered   but it s not necessarily seen   Yuck  right   Well  as it turned out  the HubSpot Marketing Blog had a bit of a graymail problem on our hands  Our email deliverability team wasn t mad  but they were disappointed  So we took action   Here s What We Did  We did a couple of things  actually    1  We Created Automated Workflows to Unsubscribe Subscribers Once They Became Unengaged  The first thing we did was set up a workflow using HubSpot s Workflows App that automatically unsubscribes people once they hit a certain threshold of unengagement   specifically  the workflow unsubscribes someone from the Marketing Blog if they haven t clicked on an email from us in the last six months  While it was a slightly more aggressive approach  we chose  clicks  over  opens  as our criteria for engagement since open rate is an unreliable email marketing metric   Our workflow also triggers an email to these unengaged recipients to let them know they re getting unsubscribed  and attempts to re engage them   As you already know  this workflow unsubscribed about 250 000 unengaged subscribers right off the bat  It also continues to unsubscribe people as they become unengaged  strengthening the quality of our email list and helping to prevent the ill effects of graymail   Here s What Happened    If you think we didn t have anxiety about unsubscribing 45  of our list  you re dead wrong  But once we got over the sticker shock  we realized there wasn t really anything to be worried about   After all  550 000 subscribers is nothing but a vanity metric if 250 000 of those people aren t actually engaging with your content  And the people we were unsubscribing hadn t clicked through to our blog from any of the emails we d sent them over the course of the last 6 months  so we weren t at risk of losing any email traffic   2  We Eliminated the Marketing Blog s  Instant  Subscription  Shortly after we activated our unengaged subscriber workflow  Marketing Blog Manager Ginny Soskey also made the decision to completely eliminate the Marketing Blog s instant subscription option  which had been sending instant subscribers a separate email for each new post we published  Instead  she moved those instant subscribers over to our daily subscription  which sends a once daily round up of our best new posts   When we made the switch  we also sent an email to our former instant subscribers to let them know we were discontinuing our instant subscription in favor of our daily email  and that their inboxes would be a little lighter for it   We did this for several reasons  but I ll highlight a couple of the major ones here  For one  the graymail problem  Because of the volume at which we publish to the Marketing Blog  we were sending over four emails per day to our instant subscribers  which at the time consisted of about 10 000 people  That s a heckuva lot of email  which leads me to my second point   4  emails per day isn t a very lovable amount of email  In fact  it s a very unlovable amount of email  What if we ever decided to increase our publishing frequency  That would mean we d be sending even more email  Consolidating all that into one daily email that includes our best content was logical and lovable   Here s What Happened    Compared to the unengaged workflows we set up  getting rid of our instant subscription was a riskier move because   We didn t want to sabotage the traffic we were generating from our instant subscribers  Would fewer emails to our former instant subscribers lead to less blog traffic   We didn t want to upset subscribers who actually liked receiving multiple emails per day about our latest blog content   On the traffic front  we basically broke even  Sending just one email per day instead of multiple emails didn t translate into less traffic to the blog from email  This wasn t that surprising to us  because in order to lose traffic  lots of subscribers would ve needed to be clicking on more than one email per day  which was an unlikely scenario  We knew that was an unlikely scenario because we did our due diligence and analyzed the traffic to our blog from our instant emails before we made the decision to discontinue that subscription option   just to be safe   And as it turns out  what we did was actually a welcome change for most of our instant subscribers  The majority of the email replies we received were very positive and included sentiments like this    Thanks for giving me some breathing room  I can use it     Thanks for that  I was close to ending my subscription  to be honest     But now  never     This is a much better solution for me  Thanks for practicing what you preach to make my experience better    From the few people who spoke up and said they were actually disappointed about the discontinuation of our instant subscription  we noticed two common themes   People like being in control of their own inboxes  Of the blog emails we send them  they like being able to choose which ones to click on  and which ones to delete   Some people genuinely like to read every email blog post we send them   Time to Reinvent Blog Content Distribution   While most people were in favor of our switch to fewer emails  the reasons some people were disappointed shed light on an opportunity for improvement on the blog content distribution front   There s got to be a better way to give these subscribers what they want than by flooding their inboxes with email messages   For blogs  content distribution to subscribers has always boiled down to either email notifications or RSS  but is there a better way   particularly when it comes to instant notifications  For instance  what if there was a way to automatically send instant subscribers a tweet whenever a new post was published  Could someone invent a completely new platform or tool that helps to solve this problem   Perhaps better personalization is the solution here  If people want to have control over their own inboxes  maybe offering more robust subscription options is the answer  allowing subscribers to decide which types of blog content they were emailed about  If people were able to subscribe only to the content they re interested in  instant email notifications would become much more tailored to the subscriber and a whole lot more valuable as a result   This is definitely something we ll be noodling on  so let us know if you have any ideas,"[1063 814 936 931 117 83 511 154 723 538 1390]"

1065,training-dataset/business/783.txt,business,How We Celebrate Holidays at An International Startup Editor s Note  We ve updated this a bit since we originally posted this in December of 2015   as we re excited that policies are continually growing and evolving as we grow as a company    Some people might be surprised to hear that we didn t used to get time off for Christmas at Buffer or for Hanukkah  Canadian Thanksgiving  Chinese New Year or any specific holiday at all   Instead  we had unlimited time off and the full trust of our teammates to make great decisions about how to use this privilege   That all changed mid way through 2016  however  We realized that our unlimited policy was perhaps too loose and we found many team members were only taking 5 10 days off a year  We have now switched to a minimum vacation policy of at least 3 weeks off per year   As part of this  and not included in those recommended 3 weeks off   we re strongly urging our team members to observe the public holidays of their region or country   And we re testing for the first time  closing  our company down for two days this holiday season  Dec 26th and Jan 2nd    Working on a remote  international team with this policy creates some really unique challenges as well as some super cool learning opportunities  I d love to explore them both with you   Our general holiday  policy   Our general holiday guidelines are pretty simple   Default to taking time off on the public holidays of the country in which you re living  or the public holidays of your home country that are important to you   Request other time off with team leads via the tool we use  Timetastic   Share early  if possible  about time you d like to take off or may be unavailable for   Ask for advice or notify the people you work closely with about your plans   Dan sums it up pretty well in this post about the American holiday of Labor Day   Here s a peek at our Timetastic wall for the People  our human resources  team   What works about this  and what we re still working on  Here are some things that are really awesome about this way of looking at holidays   Our company trusts us to set our own schedules and make our own decisions  We get to learn a ton about holidays and traditions around the world  With all of us celebrating different holidays at different times  there s pretty much always someone around to take care of Buffer s awesome customers  And here s one thing that we could probably do a better job of  Taking more holidays that matter to us and encouraging people to fully disconnect   We ve struggled a bit with tracking the most essential public holidays around the world   there are thousands   We re working to integrate alerts to better convey to the team when there might be a holiday coming up  Our latest experiment connects Google s holidays calendars for each country to our Slack account via Zapier   Similar to what we ve discovered about our unlimited vacation policy  sometimes a looser structure with no defined days off can lead to fewer holidays taken or a feeling of uncertainty about what s appropriate and expected as far as time off  This is why we re starting to be clearer and send team wide announcements in advanced that encourage time off and hopefully remind teammates that celebrating and disconnecting is a great choice   A few holiday messages from our Discourse chats  The main spot we share holiday plans and requests for advice is in Discourse  our discussion tool that cuts down on our need to send email   I rooted through our Discourse to find some neat holiday messages to share  Here are a few neat examples   Learning about the Dragon Boat festival  In this message  Steven  based in Taipei  tells us a little about the Dragon Boat Festival holiday   Time off for Pride  One of our amazing Happiness Heroes  Dave  took some time off for a holiday that s important to him Manchester Pride  Here s how he shared his plans and worked with other teammates to ensure customers would be well taken care of   Christmas in Cape Town  Wonder what Christmas is like in South Africa  Here s the plan for Niel  one of awesome engineers based in Cape Town   Chinese New Year  Eric shared this cool photo from his Chinese New Year celebrations   Yesterday was the first day of the Chinese New Year  I went to the temple to make my wishes   One of the tradition is that we write the name of people we wish they ll have health  luck   and money  D   on a kind of yellow book  We then throw this in the fire with some firecrackers  a lot actually  p  to fear of the  bad spirit    We love seeing teammates take family time  Not all holidays have to be about observing a national moment or meaningful event  They can be as simple as taking time off to watch movies and eat Chinese food for  Jewish Christmas   as Arielle explains below  or turning a holiday into a chance to spend some time with a loved one  as Ivana shows   Over to you  I think one of the coolest part of our holiday policy is the ability for each teammate to reflect on their own beliefs  time and energy and choose the holiday schedule that best represents those elements   If you were to choose your own holiday schedule  what holidays would you pick,"[1065 51 1073 72 1025 1174 1011 421 213 1316 1145]"
1072,training-dataset/product/918.txt,product,Innovators think in terms of verbs  not nounsOver time and as a company grows  the ability to deliver inspiring solutions often fades  Many organizations talk about returning to their roots or becoming more nimble in the digital age  and they presume doing so requires shaking up corporate structure   But industry leaders in large part attribute their organizations  resurgent innovativeness not to reorganization  but to a simple shift in mindset about how their teams approach customer centricity  Powered by empathetic product managers and designs  companies of any size can meaningfully and continuously innovate   In the face of changing market dynamics  product teams tend to approach customers within the context of their own organization s existing processes and product portfolios  Author and professor Donald Sull describes such behavior as  active inertia   Rather than suffering from paralysis  which is often intuitively perceived as the enemy   companies take actions that are hamstrung by the narrow minded perspective of past solutions   As Sull elaborates    the  fresh thinking that led to a company s initial success is often replaced by a rigid devotion to the status quo    Contrary to conventional wisdom  Blockbuster didn t fail because of an unwavering refusal to embrace digital  The problem was that Blockbuster s revenues were largely dependent on its notorious late fees which couldn t easily be justified using a subscription model  When Blockbuster s CEO proposed dropping late fees so that the organization could transition  other executives were quick to point out how immediately disruptive that would be to its revenue streams  Key stakeholders were constrained by an overreliance on what had worked in the past  and ousted the CEO  Blockbuster eventually launched a watered down version of Netflix but it was too little too late  and the company soon declared bankruptcy   When approaching innovation  the renowned designer co founder of IDEO  Bill Moggridge  urged his colleagues to understand that  we are designing verbs  not nouns   Moggridge had experienced Blockbuster s pain more than 2 decades earlier while designing one of the first commercial laptops  Despite winning countless awards for its elegant physical design  the laptop was severely limited because it ran on the clunky DOS operating system   As IDEO s current CEO Tim Brown described the device in his book Change by Design    To perform the simplest operation  it was necessary to type an arcane sequence of commands that bore no relation to lived experience in the sharpest contrast to the ingenious device  which folded in half like a notebook and disappeared into a briefcase    The dilemma led Moggridge to realize that  to be successful  designers must address the core customer activity  He had designed a portable computer but didn t enable customers to work   As part of The Innovation Benchmark  we interviewed a number of design and innovation leaders across the Fortune 500 that echoed a similar sentiment  Products and solutions become stale as customer activities evolve  and it is a relentless obsession with the verb instead of the noun that enables organizations to continuously innovate   Ford Motor Company has spent more than a century selling cars and trucks  but the organization thinks about its business more holistically   It s about providing personal mobility and really doing so in an affordable manner   says Venkatesh Prasad  a Senior Technology Leader at Ford  responsible for open innovation  Cars may have replaced the horse and buggy  but Ford innovates not by continuing to engineer cars but by enabling customers to travel  They ve reframed their product narrative around the entire travel experience   For example  Prasad sees opportunities when noting trends in consumer travel that extend beyond traditional car ownership or leasing   We certainly are in the world where we use cars one way or the other  whether that s getting a ride from A to B or sharing a ride with someone else   he says   That thinking has led the company to invest heavily in research and development into ride sharing apps and self driving capabilities  Ford also recently announced the spin out of a wholly owned subsidiary  Ford Smart Mobility LLC  to design  build  grow  and invest in emerging mobility services  Both initiatives reflect Ford s expanded business model of being both an auto and mobility company   Related  How to move from imitation to innovation  But an increase in scope must be accompanied by an increase in efforts  and Ford isn t afraid to call for reinforcements  The company has joined the OpenXC movement  an open source project that enables third party developers to read car data  Prasad says that many of the applications are obvious  like the ability to notify drivers about potholes  hydroplaning  and other environmental hazards  But he believes the initiative s potential is limitless  and he s excited to see what external experts can come up with    It s possible to see how digital platforms come in handy as a critical connector and can drive core business efficiencies and innovation on the one hand   Prasad states   And then  of course  make people s lives better through mobility on the other hand    And that s long been Ford s mission  reflected even within the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn  Michigan   You go in there and of course you see a lot of transportation exhibits  but you also see the flashing light of a Holiday Inn exhibit   Prasad describes   You wonder what that s doing there  but Holiday Inn came to be because people were able to go further distances and didn t have a place to stay  So  it s those kinds of ecosystems  synergies  and adjacencies we see in the future    But Ford doesn t have a monopoly on that type of thinking  nor on the  travel  verb  When we spoke with Matthew Von Ertfelda  Vice President of Marriott s Insight  Strategy  and Innovation team  he expressed a similar outlook   With 19 brands  4 400 hotels  and over a million hotel rooms  Marriott has moved far beyond its original 9 stool root beer stand and it expects the evolution in its business to continue  Ertfelda describes the organization as  a global hotel company that we actually like to refer to as a travel company   And that directly translates into their approach to customer centricity and innovation    We see what we do as guest experiences  product and service experiences  that actually transcend individual hotels  to become a part of the life of the traveler and consumer   he says   Organizations that take holistic approaches to customer centricity offer a number of actionable takeaways for product and design leaders   Outline the verb  It s time to stop thinking about organizations as static portfolios of products  What customer pain point is being solved  and what activity is enabled because of the solution  Shift to thinking about how you can continue to learn and revise your understanding of that activity over time   Identify blockers  Organizations stagnate when they only look inward when considering opportunities for innovation  Assessing your company s existing resources and capabilities is certainly a critical step in the process  but customer centricity means that the company s processes and offerings must at times be challenged and overturned   Speak for the customer  It s undeniably difficult for companies to grow and maintain empathy for diverse and ever changing customer personas  But it s even more difficult for executives to ignore customer feedback and behavioral data  Step up and be the voice of your customer  Your competitors are already doing so   It would certainly seem intuitive that being innovative requires your company to first undergo  big  structural changes  But once you stop thinking in terms of designing products and begin thinking in terms of designing activities  you just may find that customer centricity isn t foreign after all   Read more on design leadership,"[1072 985 130 1171 323 561 1073 284 1316 154 609]"
1073,training-dataset/business/415.txt,business,What We re Changing As We TransitionStartup to Scaleup  What We re Changing As We Transition  By Joel Gascoigne  In the past couple of months  I ve had a number of thoughts around the growth Buffer has experienced in the last year and some interesting challenges and paradoxes that seems to be bringing us   I ve had a number of conversations with people in the team on this and I recently shared a version of what follows with the whole company to get their thoughts  It resonated with almost everyone  and as a result we ve started to put in place some changes based on these realizations  I d love to share it with all of you in the community here too   and get your thoughts   It fascinates me that over half of the team has been part of the team for less than a year  A year ago we were around 40 people   today we are more than 90  This is incredible and is bringing so many new perspectives for us  and helping us move faster to create amazing experiences for users and customers   One of the things that hit me about this is that a year ago  we were doing things quite differently than we are today  And rightly so  We need to operate quite differently as an 90 person company than a 40 person company   This path of thinking leads me to reflect all the way back on the first and second year of Buffer  of which only a handful of us were around and can share how that felt   I ve come to believe that we need to grow up  scale up  to be better suited to being an 80   90   100 person company  and simultaneously stay true to our roots in some areas  I believe we can benefit from keeping some of the true startup mentalities that got us off the ground and to a point where we could grow to something bigger   Perhaps the most fascinating thing for me about this article is that I equally found myself nodding and agreeing with what Julie said about startups  as well as what she says about big companies   I feel like both apply to us right now  and it dawned on me that we re right in the transition currently   In a lot of ways we need to grow up as a company  which will likely mean adopting more structure and discipline and embracing this new ability we have to specialize and reach a higher bar for many roles  In other ways  we still need to be super scrappy in startup mode   taking big risks  acting on intuition and moving fast   Here s a little table I created from her points  Again  I love how both sides are balanced  with little judgement   The early days of Buffer  When I read through the article by Julie Zhuo  I found myself thinking back to the early days of Buffer  and how we ve grown since then   It was absolutely true back then that we had one goal  to hit product market fit  That s all that mattered  If we didn t achieve it  nothing else would be possible  It s why I didn t incorporate the company until we had revenues and got our first  120k in funding  The customers we were going after didn t care about that  they just cared whether the product solved a problem  As Paul Graham says   Build something people want    Back in the early days  I built the first version of Buffer in seven weeks of evenings and weekends while working full time  I was the product creator  customer researcher  designer  front end and back end developer  systems and data analytics person  And until Leo joined  I was also the marketer and customer service person too  Of course  all those things were done pretty badly  because I m far from an expert in any of these areas  Yet  I built and launched the MVP in seven weeks  and kept iterating pretty fast  And when Leo joined  between us we fulfilled all these roles for almost a whole year  We ended up growing Buffer 40 50  month over month for the first year of Buffer   There was so much risk back then  So we had to make bigger bets  We had to try to make a big change every few weeks or even every few days  Small incremental tweaks wouldn t get us the progress we needed  As a result  there were higher highs and lower lows  The website went down a lot  we tried a lot of stuff that fell flat on its face  It felt awesome and awful all at the same time  sometimes transitioning from one to the other within hours  It was chaotic  That s where I think a lot of what Julie mentions is so true and so essential for startups  It s super valuable to be a generalist with good intuition   Thoughts on product areas and how we structure ourselves right now  I think especially Pablo and Respond are areas where I feel we could be striving for 30 50  month over month growth  which may seem crazy  however we achieved exactly that in the first year of Buffer  and we now have the marketing and brand power of Buffer to put to use on those areas  so maybe we can do even better     On the other hand  in the mobile apps and the dashboard   awesome plan  which are all more mature and have high usage numbers  I think we could potentially have a higher bar for quality  maybe even thinking about QA  These products have a ton of active users flowing through   Buffer for Business interestingly feels like it sits somewhere in the middle  where we have a somewhat steady flow of new customers from individual and awesome  yet at the same time there s a big  new product  feel to it too  where we could be moving faster to crank out all the features we need to be something attractive to larger companies and agencies and unlock the option for us to do sales   The pace we re moving at is awesome  based on the setup we have  Everyone is doing great work  it s just within the model we have  I think the biggest  aha  for me here is that we have evolved our product team structure in the last year and we ve been striving for the same setup in all areas  We have a product creator  2 3 engineers  a customer researcher  product designer  data analyst  and sometimes a product marketer  The biggest flaw I see in my thinking in the last year is striving to have this setup for all areas   What I m now starting to realize is  we should probably think about the team makeup for an area very much based on the stage that area is at  Pablo and Respond have very different needs than Individual  Awesome Plan and Mobile   Further reading  Steve Blank on the  Company Building  transition phase  It was Julie Zhuo s article that really resonated with me and somehow as I let it settle over a few days it felt clearer and clearer  I ended up chatting about it in many of my syncs in the last couple of weeks   I started to sense that we are right between these two approaches  and that in the last year  we ve started to really see that some of those  big company  characteristics are what we are starting to actually need  At the same time  I felt like we d moved away from  startup  characteristics we need for some of our innovative projects   Then it hit me that whilst Julie talks a lot about the two separately  there s nothing about how you transition from startup to big company  Then I remembered from my past reading that Steve Blank had talked a lot about this  so I started delving into all his articles   I also remembered his classic book Four Steps To The Epiphany which has a whole chapter on company building  talking exactly about this transition phase   A lot of this really resonates  That set of graphs feels to me like it s describing Pablo Respond  New Market  vs Awesome Individual  Existing Market    Also  the table is super valuable for helping me with the transition I personally need to make as CEO   This part also felt key   This evolution requires three actions   Build a mainstream customer base beyond the first earlyvangelist customers  Build the company s organization  management  and culture to support greater scale  Create fast response departments to sustain the climate of learning and discovery that got the company to this stage  A big personal takeaway is how important it is for us to now have clear vision and mission for the scaleup phase  and this is in my personal OKRs for Q1 and I now put this as a very high importance item  It s something I ve failed to give the right priority in the last 3 6 months  I have a lot of growing up to do personally to be a great CEO for Buffer as we grow   Coming soon  I ll share my thoughts in a blog post on the career paths that have emerged from this change from startup to scaleup  generalists and craftpersons   I d love to hear your thoughts in the comments  I think this is really important  I ve spent some time letting this sit with me  and this is the result of that time and reflection and several chats I ve had with people,"[1073 1025 1311 421 125 51 1174 684 561 511 1145]"
1085,training-dataset/business/7.txt,business,Peter DiamandisThis blog is about how to not to be disrupted and  perhaps more importantly  how to disrupt yourself before someone else does   I had the chance to sit down with Ed McNierney  who came out of Lotus 1 2 3 and ran Digital Strategy at Kodak  Over the years  he has learned a lot from both Lotus and Kodak s failures   Ed brings 30 years of wide ranging technology expertise to the table   and he s seen a lot of unintended disruption   Who is Ed McNierney   In the late 1980 s  Ed led the development of Lotus 1 2 3 for Windows in an attempt to compete with the highly disruptive Microsoft Excel  I ll share the full story in a minute    A few years later  he ended up leading Digital Strategy at Kodak  He didn t last long  Ed left when he experienced firsthand Kodak s unwillingness to change  rapidly racing into a brick wall of bankruptcy in 2012   He s been through several  disruptions  in his own right and has learned a lot along the way   We ll get into the Do s and Don ts from Ed s experience in a minute    but first  a bit of history and context about Lotus and Kodak   History   Context Around Lotus and Kodak  In the 80 s  Lotus was the Google of its day    it was the software company   Its core product  Lotus 1 2 3  was the killer app  it was the reason people bought PCs     In parallel  Lotus saw that Microsoft was developing Windows and another product called Excel   The Lotus team saw the incoming threat of Windows  but thought if they ignored Windows and didn t build apps for it  everyone else would stay away from Windows  too   Instead  their biggest customers    Procter and Gamble  Exxon and Shell  among others    thought differently  They were leaving Lotus and going to Windows Excel   Then Lotus rushed to bring a product to market   But they made a fatal mistake  instead of looking only forward  they made their product entirely backwards compatible  or compatible with their past   Meanwhile  Microsoft focused 100 percent on building a great Windows spreadsheet  compatibility be damned   Lotus  strategy didn t work  They couldn t keep up  Complete disruption   The company was ultimately acquired by IBM in 1995 and  today  no longer has a product line   Now  let s look at Kodak   Shortly after Ed left Lotus  he joined Kodak as its VP of Digital Strategy     This was 1996  the heyday of Kodak     Kodak had a  28 billion market cap and 140 000 employees   In 1976  20 years earlier  Kodak had invented the digital camera  They owned the IP and had the first mover advantage  This is a company that should have owned it all   Instead  in 2012  Kodak filed for bankruptcy  put out of business by the very technology they had invented   What happened   Kodak was married to the  paper and chemicals   film development  business  their most profitable division  while the R D on digital cameras was a cost center   They saw the digital world coming on  but were convinced that digital cameras wouldn t have traction outside of the professional market   They certainly had the expertise to design and build consumer digital cameras    Kodak actually built the Apple QuickTake  see photo   generally considered the world s first consumer digital camera   Ed McNierney holding Apple QuickTake  by Kodak   Amazingly  Kodak decided they didn t even want to put their name on the camera   What happened next  The  digital movement  decimated them    they simply couldn t keep up and  as mentioned  filed for bankruptcy in 2012       Graph  How the digital movement decimated print photos  It s difficult to create change in a large organization steeped in tradition  and even harder to disrupt yourself when you re cranking out cash the way Kodak was     But you have to disrupt yourself  or someone else will   During his time at Lotus and Kodak  Ed learned a lot about what not to do   Here are 8 things you shouldn t do if you want to avoid disruption   Eight Don ts   How Not To Be Disrupted  Don t close out your options too early  For Kodak  they decided they weren t going to be in the digital camera business  As a result  they stopped devoting resources to digital before it was too late  Don t eliminate new products  new markets and new opportunities from your possible pipeline  Don t be tied to your history  As Ed relayed   You have way more ahead of you than behind you    bringing the dead weight of your legacy from your past into the future can be detrimental to the business   Just because Kodak was in the paper and chemicals business doesn t mean they can t be something else  Don t be overly attached to your existing business  All existing products services will be disrupted  and revenues will eventually go to zero  Don t be attached to them  You have to move with technology and the market  This is hardest when you are profitable  like Kodak  You must be aware that you re most vulnerable when you re doing well  Don t ignore the signals  Ed mentioned   It s easy to see that little disruptive force on the horizon and think to yourself   Boy I hope that thing goes away   or   I hope if I ignore that  it s just not going to happen   Don t ignore them  Your biggest threats are probably in the deceptive phrase  Don t be tentative  Kodak built the first digital camera  But they were tentative  They didn t want to put their name on it  Don t be tentative  be bold  Don t play defense   spend money on accelerating  we ll get to this in a second   Don t say   We can t do X because it is not the way we do things    It s not the way we do it  is never a good enough argument NOT to try something new    Don t worry about the big guys  When looking at potential disruptions  don t worry about the big companies  They are usually  with some exceptions  slow moving and tentative  ironically enough  see Kodak and Lotus   Instead  you should be worrying about the small guys in a garage  They have nothing to lose  Try to find them    invest in them  partner with them or hire them  Don t fret  You are fighting against billions of years of human evolution  We have evolved to be linear thinkers  Just keep trying to innovate and avoid doing the things above  And keep reading   Now let s talk about a few things you CAN do to disrupt yourself   Six Do s of Disruption  How to Disrupt Yourself  Disrupt your adjacencies  It s hard to disrupt yourself  few companies have ever done this  So instead  try to disrupt your suppliers and or your customers  You can disrupt your suppliers by vertically integrating and building business around the systems that power your existing business  You can disrupt your customers by looking at the other products and services they are already using and build better ones  Apple  Amazon and Google are all great at both of these  Build the best products  or get a piece of them  The best product wins  Either build the best product in your category  or if you can t  find a way to get a piece of the best one  Be agile  Agility is everything  Make sure you have the right culture and people to support agility  Oftentimes organizations have an immune response to new innovations   instead  try to make innovation and change a part of your culture  Watch your customers  then listen to them  It sounds intuitive  but it s not  As Ed mentioned  Lotus saw that their customers were switching to Excel  Then they heard them say they preferred it  And yet they didn t do much about it  Your customers are your lifeblood  Listen to them and adapt to them  Build a Skunkworks  Ed mentioned   I would have loved to have had a business inside Kodak whose job it was to totally destroy the core business   I ve talked about this idea before   you need to create a safe  secure place for innovation to happen  Have an abundance mindset  As Ed puts it   There is more ahead of you than behind you   Don t be afraid to reinvent yourself   Join Me  This is the sort of conversation we explore at my 250 person

1089,training-dataset/product/1045.txt,product,Jerry Seinfeld s 12 unconventional rules for doing the best work of your lifeTo make you laugh  a comedian has to convince you that their punchline is believable  Jerry Seinfeld is the master  He makes millions not only believe his punchline but say   I can t believe I never put it like that    He takes you there  He describes exactly how you feel  and he makes it all very funny  This is his craft  He s a master technician  A true master of his domain  And the lessons he shares about his work are universal  It doesn t matter if you re a designer or a comedian  A custodian or a CEO  His approach will help you create the best work of your life   Here s Jerry Seinfeld s 12 rules for doing your best work   Find the thing people want you to spend a lot of time on wastefully   The amount of time Jerry spends thinking about what most of us consider trivial things is staggering  But he finds his best work comes when he s wasting a lot of time on stupid things  The more stupid  the better he feels about it  Your work should feel unreasonable for anyone else but you  You should spend time on details that others don t see  Every year  get rid of the bottom 10 20  of your work   Jerry makes his work keep getting better by getting rid of the bottom 10  every year  This means that every 4 5 years he has a whole new act  And it continues to evolve forever  Your work should grow with you  You should constantly be looking to improve  Start with what you consider the bottom 10   Never settle  Time your work perfectly   Jerry methodically calculates timing in his work  He likes the first thing he says in a joke to be funny right away and for the funniest part of a joke to always come at the end  How our work is experienced through time is often forgotten  Think about how you can not only deliver your best work but also deliver it at the right time   Every year  get rid of the bottom 10 20  of your work   Connect good ideas tightly until you have a smooth whole   Jerry weaves his jokes together as tightly and seamlessly as possible  He relates it to a jigsaw puzzle shaving seconds off jokes and counting syllables to make sure his next piece fits just right  Are you making sure your next piece is perfectly tailored to follow your last  Just try to be one of the people you look up to   Jerry always wanted to be like the comedians he grew up watching  Instead of shying away from admiration  he was proud of this attitude that was a part of his success  Pick the top masters in your field  and follow their example    Once I stepped on stage for the first time  that s it  I m now one of those guys   Make your work keep resurfacing in people s brains   Jerry s jokes go deep into your brain and keep coming back  He picks common topics that he feels have a special twist and tries to plant that twist into his work  If you don t feel something that s unexplainable about your work  nobody else will either    When I hear a good bit  I think about it constantly  There s some bits I heard over 10 years ago that I still think about at least once a month    Connect good ideas tightly until you have a smooth whole   Find the vessel that gives you the best chance   You might have wondered why Jerry doesn t do movies  He thinks the size of that content doesn t lends itself to great comedy  He knows the limitations of his craft and he tailors his work to it  Find the shape that suits your work and gives you the best chance    To me  the funniest things are shorter  so I think with TV series or Comedians in Cars  I have a better chance of making you laugh   Never stop practicing   Ever hear a joke and tell it to every person in your office  The last few recipients always hear the best version and laugh the most  Why  Practice  When you practice something a lot  a nerve pathway in your brain expands to contain more information  As soon as you stop practicing  the pathway begins to shrink back down  Jerry continues to practice his material in front of small crowds before going on tour    That changed my life  I used to wonder   Why am I doing these sets  getting on a stage  Don t I know how to do this already   The answer is no   Work should feel generous   When you re doing your best work  it s an act of generosity  It makes people s lives better  Keep that in perspective it s essential to a long life in your craft    If you re doing it for them you ll be fine  If you re doing it for you  you ll have problems  They ll know it  feel it  and they won t like it  When you re making people laugh you feel like you ve done a nice thing  You come off feeling much more like you gave something than if you got something   Find the torture you re comfortable with   Jerry keeps doing standup  It s not because he enjoys it  In fact  it s torture  That s why a lot of comedians stop  But Jerry hasn t  He s decided to feel comfortable with the torture because it makes his work better  Instead of trying to avoid all unpleasantness  seek the right amount of it in your work    Your blessing in life is when you find the torture you re comfortable with  That s marriage  it s kids  its work  its exercise  Find the torture you re comfortable with and you ll do well  It s no different than when you re 30 minutes into a workout  You re okay  You don t wanna wake up early  you don t wanna get dressed  you don t want to go to work  but once you re there  it s okay  Once you get going  it s fine  That s life  You master that and you ve mastered life    Find the torture you re comfortable with   Trudge your ass in   Jerry believes writer s block is a phony  made up excuse for not doing your work  The way to be better at comedy is to create better jokes and the way to create better jokes is to write every day  It s the same for you    I realized construction workers don t want to go back to work after lunch  But they re going  That s their job  If they can exhibit that level of dedication for that job I should be able to do the same   Bust your ass  pay attention  and fall in love   Only good can come from working as hard as you can  People don t absorb enough of the world around them  despite the fact that you can learn everything from what s around you  We don t stop to say how great something is  Stop and take that moment because it s not always great  Fall in love when it is   Want to read about Jerry s formula for accomplishing anything you want in life  Check that out on Robert s website  Let s Workshop   This post was originally published on Medium,"[1089

1112,training-dataset/business/398.txt,business,Why You Can t Search for a Job From a Remote LocationWhy You Can t Search for a Job From a Remote Location  I ve had this conversation many times  A friend calls me up from  Boston  New York  Chicago  San Francisco  wherever and says   I m thinking about moving to Los Angeles  or SF  NY  etc  and I d love to start interviewing  Let me know if you hear of anything interesting    I usually slip into counsel mode and tell them it s a lost cause unless they re truly committed to living in that city and if they are they should move there first and job search second   If you really are committed to moving to a new city you simply won t find the best or right job without feet on the street   no matter what anybody else may have told you  At a minimum you need to put yourself in that city for weeks in a row and appear to be local to maximize the quality of the job you get or the probability of getting one in the first place   Intuitively you know it s kind of obvious that you can t realistically search remotely but it s hard to make a commitment to actually moving unless you re confident you d get a great job so you have a chicken and egg problem of  what if I move there and don t find the right job      Finding the best jobs takes a lot of commitment to taking many different networking meetings with executives  recruiters  entrepreneurs  VCs  lawyers  etc  The best jobs are of course found through personal connections and in person  eyeball to eyeball contact   The best jobs are the ones that have not already been put on a job board  The best jobs are the ones that haven t gone out to an executive recruiter  The reason these are the  best  jobs for you is that once it goes to an executive recruiter there will be a stack of 100 prospective recruits  20 amazingly qualified resumes that will have in person interviews with the recruiter of which the company will meet 5 6  So unless your last job is a mirror image of your next then good luck with those odds   So it takes  on the ground work  to find the right job  And that ain t gonna happen from your LinkedIn messages to buddies you haven t spoken to in 3 years  It s not even going to happen from your 3 day exploratory trips every 6 8 weeks  It takes a sustained effort to get the right job  Sure  you can land  a  job  just not  THE  job   And there are other reasons   If you really think you re committed to Los Angeles   then just move there  Make a life decision  None of this wishy washy hedging your bets   Well I don t want to move to LA only to find out that I get a job in San Fran and now I have to move twice  I mean I d love to live in LA but what I really want is the perfect job wherever that is   OK  great  So you re in NY and you move to neither LA nor SF and you re going to sub optimize your job opportunities in both LA and SF  Let s see how that works out   Any hiring manager at a company who has any operational experience and common sense will never want to hire somebody remotely anyways  Anybody with experience has been burned by somebody else just like you who wanted to get hired for a remote job  Here s a few flavors      I m going to move to LA but my kids are in school  As soon as the school year ends they re going to move out   Code for   I m going to see how I like the job for 6 months  I can t drag my family to LA and then have to drag them back again if I don t like the job   Fair enough  I can understand the logic  But I want people that I know are committed to living in the city I m hiring  If a hiring manager can find an equivalent candidate already living in that city you can be sure you re on the bottom of that candidate stack  So the odds of the best jobs are against you      I m going to move my family to NYC but I need to sell the house first  I can t afford to take a loss on it  So I ll commute for the first 6 12 months   Code for   OK  I really DO have to sell my house but I also have a great excuse to hedge my bets and see whether I really like the company before truly committing to moving    Yeah  I know I could probably rent the house out   but why should I do that  I don t mind commuting   Long distance  long term commuting usually   unhappy family life   unhappy employee   less productive employee   unhappy you  The reality is that the  I can t move until I sell my house  is yet another hedge and great hiring managers see right through it    My wife is finishing up her masters at University of Chicago  So I can t move until she finishes   Again  understandable  If she s not up for transferring to Berkeley   that s fine  Call me in 2 years when she s graduated  But if I sign up to hiring you and you commute from Chicago I m only signing up to problems in 9 months  So I ll look for a better suited candidate   So     If you re deeply committed to living in a city   move there  If you really care about having the perfect job then being in market increases your probability 100x  Choose life  Choose your location  Move there  Get settled in  Take the time to know the city  Get your partner or family bedded down and comfortable with the place without the stress of your new work hours  And then set out to shake every hand and kiss every baby in town until you ve networked yourself into the ideal role   And if you re not ready to make this commitment   which is totally understandable   then better you acknowledge it to yourself and stay put into you re really ready to move  Hunker down   enjoy your time locally until you re ready for a move   And if you re a hiring manager considering hiring somebody who has to commute for a year or two   caveat emptor  I m not saying it would never work  But unless you truly have no local candidates   why take the risk   Good luck,"[1112 1316 456 561 154 51 1390 1145 362 667 609]"
1115,training-dataset/business/686.txt,business,5 things publishers can learn from how Jeff Bezos is running The Washington Post  Nieman Journalism LabEditor s note  Nieman Lab contributor and Northeastern University professor Dan Kennedy has spent the past semester as a Joan Shorenstein Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School  researching the digital and business strategies of The Washington Post under the ownership of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos  His paper outlining his findings is available on the Shorenstein Center s website  here s an excerpt focusing on what other publishers can learn from Bezos  leadership   Bob Woodward  the legendary Washington Post reporter who was one half of the duo that brought down a president  spoke at the First Parish Church in Cambridge last October to promote a new book  The Last of the President s Men was about Alexander Butterfield  the aide who revealed the existence of the taping system in Richard Nixon s White House  thus proving that he really was a crook   Toward the end of the evening  a member of the audience asked Woodward how the media business had changed over the years  Woodward responded by praising Jeff Bezos  the founder and chief executive of the retail and technology behemoth Amazon  who bought the Post in 2013 for  250 million    I think he s helping us as a business   Woodward said   It s a better website  I find things much more authoritative  quite frankly  than The New York Times   Times partisans would surely disagree  but Woodward is nothing if not a loyal employee  He continued   Bezos is good news for the newspaper  The Washington Post  I think he has a long range view  staying in for 15 or 20 years and making sure The Washington Post is one of the surviving news sources in the country    Is Bezos on his way to fulfilling Woodward s hopes  Nearly three years in  there s no question that he has infused the organization with a significant jolt of journalistic and technological energy  The Post is bigger  better and reaching more people than was the case before he bought the paper from the Graham family  Less clear is whether that is solely a function of Bezos s enormous financial resources or   even more important   if his ownership offers any lessons for the newspaper business in general  which continues to lose readers and advertising revenue at an alarming rate   In assessing the Bezos effect  three factors stand out as unique to the Post and are thus not replicable elsewhere  the newspaper s location  in Washington  which made the Bezos directed transition from a regional to a national newspaper relatively simple  Bezos s deep pockets  which give him the ability to provide the Post with  runway   as he has put it  affording the paper time and resources to figure out a path to sustainability  and Bezos s position as chief executive of Amazon  Bezos has already made the Post s national digital edition part of Amazon Prime and the Kindle Fire  And as the media analyst Ken Doctor told me  Bezos may see having  a lead dog in the news industry  as a competitive advantage as Amazon goes up against other technology giants such as Facebook  Apple and Google   Given those unique characteristics  it is not readily apparent what other newspaper owners could learn from Bezos  Nevertheless  there are areas   some specific  some more attitudinal   from which newspapers could in fact benefit by studying the Bezos model  Here are a few   There are significant benefits to private ownership   Before Bezos bought the Post  the Washington Post Company was a publicly traded corporation  As with the Sulzberger family at the New York Times Company  the Grahams had set up their governance structure so that the family controlled a majority of the voting stock  Thus the Grahams were less beholden to Wall Street s demands for profit than most public companies  Nevertheless  they still had to satisfy shareholders by trying to maximize profits or at least minimize losses   Indeed  as newspaper after newspaper fell into the hands of publicly traded companies in the 1970s   80s  and  90s  cutting costs in order to rack up ever higher profits led to diminished journalistic capacity even before the internet fueled collapse of the past decade  Public ownership can also make it difficult for management to invest in needed innovations  Faced with the question of whether to spend on a faster  more attractive website or to return that money to shareholders  too many newspaper executives choose the latter   and may in fact have to choose the latter in order to meet their fiduciary responsibilities   Insiders emphasize that Bezos is investing in the Post in a disciplined manner  Although he has increased the number of full time journalists from about 600 to 700 and has added about 35 engineers  the newsroom is still well below the more than 1 000 who were deployed during the heyday of the Graham era   Still  Bezos  as the sole owner  does not have to answer to shareholders or anyone else  and has the ability to invest as he sees fit  It s a significant advantage at a time when there is no blueprint for running a newspaper successfully and when the emphasis needs to be on experimentation and long term thinking   There is value in getting big   At Amazon  an early imperative was to  Get Big Fast   That has been true at the Post as well  even as paid print circulation has continued to decline  According to the analytics firm comScore  the Post moved ahead of The New York Times in web traffic in October 2015  attracting 66 9 unique visitors compared to 65 8 million for the Times   a 59 percent increase for the Post over the previous year  The Post s digital presence has continued to grow since then   Throughout the news business  though  attempts to monetize online traffic by offering free content paid for by advertising have proved disappointing  The very ubiquity of digital advertising has driven down its value  Indeed  Nicco Mele  the former senior vice president and deputy publisher of the Los Angeles Times and the incoming director of the Shorenstein Center  recently said that a print ad reaching 500 000 people costs around  50 000  whereas a programmatic ad served up by Google reaching the same number of people on the same newspaper s website might bring in no more than  20   Models built on scale make zero sense to me   Mele said   because I just don t see any future there    So why is the Post pursuing a massive digital audience  For one thing  by opening the top of the customer engagement funnel as wide as possible  the Post has given itself a larger audience to try to move to the bottom of the funnel   the point at which increasingly engaged visitors are converted into paying subscribers to the Post s website and apps  In addition  as challenging as the digital advertising environment may be  it s easier to succeed with a large audience than with a small one  Finally  by building the Post s brand and reputation  Bezos will be in a better position to take advantage of revenue opportunities that may not currently exist   Bezos himself has put it this way   We have historically made a relatively large amount of money per reader on a relatively small number of readers  And we need instead to make a relatively small amount of money per reader on a much larger number of readers,"[1115 928 591

1124,training-dataset/business/248.txt,business,Finding   Attracting Your First UsersA company will only survive as long as it continues to have a strong customer base  Even the best products will fail without a steady stream of users  Luckily  once a company has attracted its first customers  maintaining demand becomes considerable easier   However  how do you go about getting those critical first customers   In this extensive blog post  we ve gathered some of the best and most valuable insights from Gagan Biyani  a Graduate of the Silicon Valley Founder Institute  as well as the co founder of Udemy and Sprig   How Do You Perform Initial Customer Research and Development   When launching Sprig  Gagan planned the company s development extensively  almost as if writing a marketing plan  One of the first things Biyani did during the formative stages of Sprig was to clearly outline the risk assumptions of the company  adhering closely to the philosophy of The Lean Startup  And the potential risks that Biyani explored weren t just potential obstacles that may negatively impact the company  but were obstacles that could potentially kill the company   Once the risk assumptions were delineated  Biyani and his team then spent the next six months researching and testing those risk assumptions  Because Sprig was a food delivery service  the company had different risk assumptions to assess  For example  for most companies their biggest question is  Will people want my product   Biyani knew that people want affordable  healthy  and tasty food  so the risk assumptions he had to investigate were how to prepare meals at scale  how to deliver them in a reasonable timeframe  how to manage orders  etc   Image from the book  Lean Customer Development  online version by Cindy Alvarez  Get Creative When Testing Your Risk Assumptions  Since preparing and delivering hot meals was such an important yet risky aspect of Sprig  Biyani had to exercise some creativity to properly test the company s risk assumptions  To start off  Biyani posted various ads calling for chefs on Craigslist  requesting a healthy and delicious meals to be made for him everyday at around  10  15 per meal  He received numerous responses from professional chefs who angrily told him that it was ridiculous to expect that healthy meals can be made at such a low cost   However  Biyani had no intention of actually hiring chefs to make him meals  what Biyani was doing was customer research  Through his various interactions with these chefs  he discovered that while preparing a single meal was expensive and time consuming  preparing many meals at the same time was ultimately cheaper and took about the same amount of time  And of course  the numbers only got better as the number of meals being made increased   Manage Your Ego  Most  if not all  entrepreneurs have confidence issues  whether it s having too much confidence or not having enough confidence  Because there are so many overnight startup success stories  it s easy for budding founders to assume that their own ideas are just great as those in the big leagues  However  there are also plenty of intelligent and hardworking individuals who think that because launching a company is so hard  their own efforts will be doomed to failure   Unfortunately  having either kind of confidence issue can be damaging for entrepreneurs  and can greatly contribute to their own biases  For example  if an arrogant entrepreneur receives some positive feedback on their idea  they may assume that that s enough validation for them to continue with their company  Or  if a less confident founder receives negative feedback on their  they may scrap it entirely instead of investigating how to make it better   Managing your ego is a much more important task than you might think  because if you don t  your customer research will be skewed  Basically  if let your confidence issues get in the way of your thinking  every bit of research you conduct will be confirmatory rather than investigatory   The most important thing about customer research is to eliminate your confirmation bias    One of the ways you can keep your ego in check and reducing confirmation bias is to assume that your basic idea isn t very good while also maintaining that you are headed in the right direction  As long as you have a strong  clear mission  it won t matter if you change the means by which you aim to accomplish it   How Do You Separate Good Feedback from Bad Feedback   Unfortunately  being able to discern good feedback from bad feedback is a skill that just can t be taught  and is one that an entrepreneur must either have naturally or have the ability to cultivate it from experience   If there is any one thing that you can do to develop a better business sense  it is to listen  Whether you re getting feedback from prospective customers  existing customers  colleagues  employees  etc   it s essential that you acquire massive amounts of feedback to base your decisions on   And when it comes to asking potential users questions  don t ever directly ask them what they think of your product  Instead  do what Biyani did and ask questions about their lifestyle and their routines and the choices they make on a regular basis to determine if your product can solve their product   For example  when Biyani was in the process of starting Sprig  he never once asked his customers  What do you think of hot meals delivered in 15 minutes   Instead he asked them questions about their eating habits  why they chose one meal over another  where they like to eat  whether they like to eat alone or with others  etc   In short  your customers don t always know what they want  but they definitely know what their problems are  so it s important to listen to determine if your solution is right for them   Where and How Do You Find the Best People to Get Feedback   Once you ve defined the industry you re starting up in  you have to interview people are most connected to that market  And remember  don t be afraid to get a little scrappy and creative to find those potential users  For Biyani  it was easy  Because he was launching a food delivery service  he figured that since everyone eats  that he should just interview strangers at cafes and restaurants   If you believe that millennials would be most interested in your company  interview people at bars  clubs  colleges  etc  If you are looking to launch an enterprise company  interview people who work at the types of companies you d be catering to   How Do You Get Your Very First Customers   When first starting a company  you will probably have very little or no money to work with  Fortunately  a lack of funds shouldn t stop you from finding at least a few people who are interested in trying out your product or service  For example  when preparing the beta launch of Sprig  Biyani and his co founders emailed just about everyone they knew who lived in the area  regardless of whether they would be interested in their company or not   This is sound advice for budding founders as even friends  family members  colleagues  and casual acquaintances can make for great first customers  And even if they themselves aren t interested in what you have to offer  there s a good chance that they might help spread the word on social media   In fact  having previous professional experience in the industry you re starting up in can give you a significant edge when it comes to acquiring your first customers  If you have friends or coworkers or colleagues who would be interested in your product or service  consider them your potential first customers  Or  at the very least  ask them about other professionals in their networks who might benefit from what you have to offer  Doing so can dramatically decrease the amount of guesswork needed to find where your target customers are and how to reach them   And to leave

1145,training-dataset/business/1348.txt,business,Ways We WorkWhat do you find the most challenging about the work you re doing   The thing that stands out to me is that we re a young company and there s so much we need to do  It s about being able to sit down and say   Okay  what are the things that will really make a difference because we can t afford to do everything today   I feel in general at startups and every startup I ve been at  that s always been the struggle  Even the things that you know are going to work for you  you just can t do it all  You have to prioritize   One of the first things I said to our team when I came in was that I would actually be giving them less to do  To stop doing the things that just aren t a priority at the moment  I felt like there was some discomfort around that at the beginning  because you worry if you ll be less valuable  But already in the first few weeks  I ve already had team members come back and say   It s great  we can focus  and we re getting so much stuff done   It was such a good feeling and I realized that s something we just need to keep doing   We re still in our early days so there is so much we need to do  It s just about balancing short term needs like   the sales team is going to a conference  so how do I make sure they re as successful as they can be  While at the same time making sure we set up our inbound marketing  which takes a long time to start working and bringing people in  We don t want to be six months from now wishing we had started it  So I would say in summary  balancing the short term and the long term goals  that s definitely my biggest challenge   How do you know  on a personal level  when it s time to take on a new challenge or start something new   For me  that time has come several times over my career  I ve been working for a long time  so I ve been in a number of different roles  I think fundamentally it s when I feel like I m not learning anymore  or when I m not pushing myself  If things start becoming too routine  I usually feel like that s when I know  Usually  I try to look within the company to see if I can grow there  Can I take on more responsibility  Can we go beyond what we are doing now   But sometimes that s just not possible  I ve been at companies where they don t want to invest more in marketing  or other departments have more priority  and so that s just kind of where they are  I ve worked for one company which   I didn t really totally understand this when I joined   but I realized while I was there that it was really more of a lifestyle business for the owners   There was nothing wrong with that but it meant that it wasn t the right place for me  I m a very ambitious person and I want to keep growing  I don t work to just make money  I really love what I do  I want to learn  If I feel like I m just kind of maintaining things over and over and we aren t really doing anything new  that s usually a sign for me that I ve either got to find that in a side project or I ve got to figure out a way to do it in my role  Whether that s in the same company or at a different company,"[1145 51 1316 609 154 561 1390 327 684 667 456]"
1152,training-dataset/business/777.txt,business,Get the most out of your research with storytellingThe job of research is to distill complex problems so that your team understand the what  the why  and the how of the problem at hand  Yet when presenting complex yet eye opening data to colleagues  a tidy 10 page report can fail to elicit the right reaction  That s because when it comes to sharing research with your colleagues  presentation matters  The right presentation can transform something that sits on your colleague s desk collecting dust into insights your team can really empathize with  And one of the best ways to present strategic  complex  controversial  or high volume data is to use storytelling  The impact storytelling can have on a product team Stories are a people friendly way of sharing and understanding complex data  If you re working with a team that has diverse skillsets and varying technical knowledge  storytelling is a powerful tool  By presenting your project as a story  you not only make your data easily comprehensible  but you immediately established common ground for your team to work together on  That means more participation and collaboration from the entire product team  If you want your team to actually remember your insights  stories will help  In fact  it s scientifically proven that stories are easier to remember than facts  meaning your presentation will have a lasting impact on the team  So how can you use data to tell the most impactful story  Telling the story Firstly  you first need to understand what your key takeaway is  When the presentation is over  what insights should the audience be left with  This will be the anchor to your story  When you re sifting through a pile of key insights trying to find your anchor consider two things  the prominence of the insight in the data  and your audience  The best anchor will resonate the most with your audience and will either be  the most prominent insight in the data  or  a large cluster of insights that all support the same key takeaway Once you ve found your anchor  you can use the rest of your insights to thread together the presentation in a way that supports it   Looking through your insights can be intimidating  Often there will be many insights that can serve as anchors  and several ways to weave your story together  When you re starting to craft a story  using a process to develop it is key  Most people are eager to jump into creating a presentation so they can share their insights  dumping data into Keynote before knowing the story they re going to tell  This can actually slow you down  and complicate your storyline  A great trick to quickly nail down your storyline before you sweat the details of a digital presentation is to create your high level presentation with Post Its  Each Post It serves as a slide  You don t have to have the final content decided at this point  but each Post It should capture the main point of each slide  As you start to flesh out your story  move the Post Its around to make sure the story you re telling makes the right point in a concise and coherent way  When you re happy  read through the headlines of each Post It  If you re not getting hung up on the order the information is presented  your high level presentation is done  Once the story makes sense  scan through and highlight anything particularly complex  anything that uses multiple pieces of data  and any place where your audience might get lost   Storyboarding your presentations first is a great way of making sure you re making the right point before we go on to sweat the details of a digital presentation  Using visuals as a storytelling device Visualizing insights  while intimidating to a lot of folks that deal with data  is the best part of the process once you get a handle on it  Firstly  decide what type of visual will be most impactful for you to use  An evolution warrants a timeline  a comparison can use a Venn diagram  whereas showing an opportunity space would need a two by two matrix   A timeline can easily show how something changes as time goes on   A Venn diagram can show a comparison between multiple objects   A two by two matrix can clearly show where the opportunity space is  Once you ve picked out your visual  it s time to put pen to paper and start sketching  yes  real pen and real paper   As you re sketching there are a few things to keep in mind  Make your life easy by using simple shapes first  Start with squares and circles  and move onto more complex shapes if your visual doesn t get the point across   Use color intentionally  Never make your audience think about why you re using a specific colour   When you start sketching  start with one color  If the drawing doesn t make sense  add more color to see if that helps   It often takes me 2 3 quick sketches before I decide on the visual I want to use  but sketching them before I create them digitally saves me hours of time  As you re doing this  you will notice that even simple visuals have multiple pieces of information your team will need to understand  Even with a visual that makes sense  this can be a lot for someone to take in when it s the first time they re seeing the information  So once you ve created a visual that matches your storyline  deconstruct it  Breaking your visual into multiple pieces will leave you with a visual that s crystal clear for your team to understand   Deconstructing your visual into individual elements can help you identify additional pieces of information your team will need to understand the larger insight  With a solid diagram sketched out in story form  you can move on to making your digital presentation  Start by creating your final visual first  making sure you leave room at the top of the slide to add a title  When you re happy with it  duplicate the slide and start to deconstruct the visual  This will ensure your visual is consistent in size  colour  and positioning from slide to slide  When your visual story is in place  it s time to add a title to each slide  Rather than simply describing the visual itself  add active titles  Active titles add all important context as you move from slide to slide  With titles and diagrams finalised  the last step is to flesh out the presentation as you normally would,"[1152 553 1314 649 95 561 232 987 1204 288 567]"

that sticks  It starts from the small things  from the logo and typeface you choose  to the way you organize your company  Each of these things are a trail of breadcrumbs that lead back to your company and amplify your brand  To distill what makes a powerful brand  we started from the breadcrumbs  We analyzed the brand guides of 50 different companies  from startups just making a name for themselves like Venmo  to established behemoths like Facebook and Google  This is what we learned   We ve aggregated this data from brand guides we ve designed as well as external data  Although we break down trends  nothing here is specific to a single client s brand guide   A Quick Note on Methodology  A brand guide also known as a  brand book  or  style guide  is the bible of your company s brand  It s a guide for how the world will see and understand you  Brand guides are typically a variation of the following elements   A brief on the company  its mission  and its history  Logo specifications  Typography  Color palette  They tell vendors  publications and even your customers how to use your logo and tagline whether it should sit on a monochrome background  or only dark colors  They give your brand visual cohesion wherever it might live  We separated companies into four categories based on size   Startup  Companies with between 0 250 employees   Companies with between 0 250 employees  Growth  Companies with between 250   1 000 employees   Companies with between 250   1 000 employees  Corporations   Companies with between 1 000   10 000 employees    Companies with between 1 000   10 000 employees Enterprise  Companies with 10k   employees   We aimed for an even distribution of companies between each phase   Enterprise Brand Guides Are 3x Longer Than Startup Brand Guides  When a company is just getting started  it has a logo  a couple of typefaces  and best practices on how to use brand assets  This changes dramatically as companies scale  The largest companies have brand guides with 3x the pages of startups and 8x the number of words  The larger the company  the longer and more detailed the guide   Of the companies we analyzed  Apple is the best example of this  The company has a 197 page guide completely dedicated to designing instruction manuals   The comprehensive brand guide details everything from whether to hyphenate  circuit board  to how to use variables in text  The brand guide demonstrates the lengths that the company goes to deliver a unified experience and brand through all its products including the instruction booklet   Startups Are 3x More Positive Than Negative  But what a startup s brand guide lacks in length  it makes up for in verve and ambition  This was overwhelmingly proven by conducting sentiment analysis on the texts  Sentiment analysis is a method of extracting subjective information  like emotions  from words   Texts that rank positively include high valence words  like  enthusiastic  and  aficionado   which add points to the sentiment score  Words with negative connotations  like  acrid  or  brutal   subtract points  In our analysis  we found that startups use 3x the amount of positive words compared to negative ones  You can get more granular with sentiment analysis and use it to gauge specific emotions  In the graph above  we see that startups rank the highest for anticipation  which comes from words like  advent  and  urgency   Startups don t have a lot in the beginning  which is why they focus on their mission and the future to come  For example  Medium s brand guide starts with a powerful statement of purpose    So our goal is to help people pay attention to the most valuable stuff first and to have the best ideas win    Rather than giving strict guidelines for where to place its logo  the guide simply places four words beneath the logo  Understated  trustworthy  and reliable   While bigger companies often use brand guides to tell outsiders how  where  and what color a logo should be  a startup s brand book leaves room to be filled in   The Enterprise Isn t  Always  Boring  When we think of the enterprise  we think the opposite of a startup  We imagine bureaucratic nightmares and endless boredom  Sentiment analysis of brand guides showed us the complete opposite  While bigger companies use more legalese like  trademark    rights   and  assets   they also scored higher in our sentiment analysis on a per word basis  A full 6  of enterprise company brand guides have positive connotations  compared to 3 8  for startups   The best companies are never tedious when they describe design  Soundcloud  a corporation in our study  cheekily instructs designers that  a cloud needs air   when describing how to use its distinctive cloud logo  Cisco  a massive enterprise with 70 000  employees uses its brand guide to contain the gravitas of its mission  and ends with a short sentence   For best results  keep it simple    While startups leave blanks to be filled in  brand guides in the upper bracket of companies we analyzed are focused on their mission and purpose  But while the words can rank high when plugged into a computer  they sometimes ring hollow to human ears  When Cisco describes its font as  cross cultural  and  cross platform   it s hard to get excited   23  of Companies Use Blue as a Primary Color  Tech companies love blue  a fact that we originally discovered by designing 200 pitch decks  Blue was the most popular color at the Startup  Corporation  and Enterprise stage  A study on the psychology of color demonstrated that consumers are more likely to trust brands that have adopted blue as their color of choice  Blue gives off an impression of stability  while the color red provokes excitement  Here is a pie chart with the most popular colors for all companies   Skype is a company that s known for its trademark light blue  and it strictly enforces this choice of color across all brand assets   The beginning of the brand guide points out that   You wouldn t wear one blue and one orange sock  Take a moment to think about how you apply the Skype logo    Startups Are 4 75x More Likely to Choose a Free Font  56  of startups opted for free fonts available on Google Fonts  while 68  of companies at every other stage shelled out money to services like Typekit and Fonts com  Startups choose fonts like Open Sans and Lato that are available for free and optimized for the web   Companies that have more cash to burn  however  aren t always more creative  20  of all companies stuck to Helvetica for their font face  making it the most popular font across company stages   Parallels  a company that provides hardware virtualization software  uses the Helvetica font family due to its  universal acceptance  legibility  and range of font weights   The way that the company describes this choice in its brand guide mesh with the company s larger mission of  efficiency and optimization    Scale Design With Your Brand  KPCB s 2016 design in tech report shows that customers are 6x more likely to make a purchase following a positive emotional experience and 12x more likely to recommend your brand to their friends  Design isn t just a  nice to have  it s what will allow you to forge these emotional connections as you scale your business  The best brand guides that we ve seen aren t the ones that are over designed and chock full of rules  They re the ones that tell a story  Ultimately  this will make or break your brand  Good design isn t about having a pretty logo you can splash across your marketing materials  It s about delivering a cohesive experience for your customers and your audience,"[1169 782 97 1189 595 723 536 51 1330 437 1360]"
1171,training-dataset/business/797.txt,business,Lessons from Companies That Put Purpose Ahead of Short Term ProfitsWe have recently seen a number of corporations make decisions that by historical norms would appear to be at odds with what we would expect from leaders of major companies  Consider these three examples   In 2014 the US healthcare retailer CVS decided to stop selling cigarettes  at an estimated cost of  2 billion  due to it being  the right thing for us to do for our customers and our company to help people on their path to better health   according to Larry Merlo  CEO  He went on to say  put simply  the sale of tobacco products is inconsistent with our purpose    Paul Polman  the CEO of Unilever  announced that shareholders should sell if they did not agree with his decision to stop giving quarterly results and focus on the long term creation of value that is  equitable  shared and sustainable   This meant a focus on doubling revenues while reducing the carbon footprint by half  and sourcing 100  of its raw materials using environmental  social  and ethical principles   Insight Center Operations in a Connected World Sponsored by Accenture The technologies and processes that are transforming companies   In the last few months  the food company Mars has sought to align its activities with its stated purpose of  better food today  a better world tomorrow  through saying to customers that  new labeling will indicate how often it is recommended you consume these products  based on how long it takes the body to restore balance after eating these meals    In all three cases  we are not only seeing companies articulate a purpose that goes beyond just delivering returns to shareholders   but also making decisions that  at least in the short term  will cost them in terms of reduced revenues and or increased costs   What we are seeing is no longer a conflict between doing the  right  thing and commercial success  but rather  a complex interaction of factors that has the characteristics of a paradox   a situation in which oppositional tendencies are brought into close contact  The fundamental challenge is how to use such paradoxes to inform creative tensions   which lead to innovation and growth   rather than succumb to paralyzed indecision or poor judgment calls   The leaders who resolve paradoxes follow a predictable path  they accept them  confront them  and figure out how to transcend them  Here s a little more detail on each   Acceptance   Clearly articulate what a broad variety of stakeholders expect from your company over the short  medium and long term   pay special attention both to non obvious ones who may not be vocal  and to those who may appear excessively vocal or negative   Understand and collectively acknowledge  in an appropriate way for different audiences  what the paradoxes are between these views and positions  An ability to hold these frequently conflicting views  without succumbing to the need to reduce discomfort and anxiety  is a key leadership trait   Confrontation   Reach out to stakeholder groups that have been highly critical of your corporation  Several leading companies have entered into negotiation conflict resolution processes with groups such as NGOs and indigenous communities to find ways to accommodate their voices in the corporate decision making activity   Recognize that it may take time  think months or years  to resolve a paradox that is heavily embedded in old structures  As the CEO of a leading food company recently told me  in a response to a question about sugar in their products   we could sell those businesses   but we would only be giving the problem to someone else  We could shut them down   but the market space would not go away and another company s products would fill it  The only responsible reaction is to evolve customer taste away from overconsumption of harmful products  This is our ethical responsibility and it will take time    Transcendence   Don t strategize using old labels regarding what industry you are in  or what it takes to succeed in that industry  as it only paints half the picture  and may become increasingly redundant  For example  are you a drinks company which makes money from the sale of alcoholic beverages   and whose continual growth is dependent on increased consumption with corresponding health and social consequences  Or are you a company that makes social interactions more successful   something that alcohol can do   but this reframing opens up space for innovation and growth from many different types of products and services as well   Make and announce brave decisions  rather than just statements of purpose  to stop doing things that are out of alignment with your  purpose   Announcing what you will start doing is as important as what you will stop doing in the process of transformation   The outcome of this process is not a polished statement of purpose   but significant decisions grounded in a deep understanding of purpose characterized by a quiet sense of service to something greater than the immediate needs of customers and short term demands of investors   Leaders have to get this right  The failure to resolve paradoxes between  purpose  and  performance  can lead to cynicism and low levels of trust in the authenticity of the corporation and its leaders  increases in regulation and fines by governments  a failure to attract high quality employees  and ultimately a failure to grow  innovate  and provide a return to investors   This isn t simply about  doing the right thing    the fact is  in a messy world there may be many  right things  and doing one of them may mean not doing others  There will always be tradeoffs  This is about identifying and investing in new market opportunities  some of which may be still emergent  and that are aligned to your organization s larger purpose  That not only pleases the diverse stakeholders you face today  but sets your organization on the path to a more stable and sustainable future,"[1171 1011 1145 51 760 130 589 561 1316 266 1072]"

number of hats   My first job out of university was as an intern at a startup doing public relations  PR  for them  I cold called reporters with pitches  wrote press releases and even did some ghost writing  I was the first PR person they had ever hired  and have since been the first person to be hired in a full time public relations role at three other startups   I completely adore PR  and social media   and have been working doing just that in the tech industry for close to five years now  My PR role at Buffer has been one of the most unique ones so far  I m very grateful to be Buffer s first Press Crafter and I d love to share with you what it s like   What is a Press Crafter   In the job description posted on our journey page when I applied  a Press Crafter at Buffer was be someone who   works with product to help talk about new and exciting features   handles inbound requests   manages the syndication program at Buffer   As you can imagine  things change frequently at Buffer and many of our roles evolve as we try on more and more hats   The role of press crafting at Buffer definitely includes those three items from the initial job description  but it s also changed a lot  I also   handle all speaking and sponsorship requests   send out a bi weekly email to all of our users with our latest blog content  product release notes and exciting announcements   help host our social media podcast   and a few other exciting things   A few fun stats   Buffer teammates spoke at 30 conferences in 2016  Gmailmeter helped me estimate that I send about 2 400 emails in one year       I think a good way to look at it is that my the focus is on positioning Buffer to a few public audiences  our users  marketing partners such as conferences or other software companies we work closely with  and of course  the media around the world   At Buffer  it s also a privilege to be able to work on PR from two perspectives  We build software that helps businesses manage their social media  but we are also a radically transparent company continually doing workplace culture experiments and looking to help shape the future of work  Both of these aspects produce lots of news and stories to tell   What is especially unique in my role at Buffer is due to our value of transparency  I never need to worry that I ve said too much  Still  there are times we strategically don t reveal everything right away  specifically if we re waiting to get all of the pieces together for an announcement  or if we want to reflect even more before sharing   On the marketing team  I work closely with the seven other members of our small team   Our marketing team at Buffer  from top left  Alfred  Arielle  Ash  Bonnie  Brian  Spencer  myself and Kevan      How does PR fit into Buffer

Media  I work super closely with our Social Media Manager at Buffer  Brian  In some companies  social media and PR can even be the same role  Here are a few ways we work together   Sharing press mentions and articles that could be great fits for social media  Keeping each other in the loop on upcoming speaking engagements with Buffer employees  Using social media to build strong relationships with reporters  Working together on social media messaging and timing for launches  announcements and campaigns  figuring out what we are saying  when and to who  I was also fortunate enough to be selected as a  bufferchat guest on  how PR and Social Media work together   here s the recap in case you re keen to learn a bit more   PR   Content Marketing  At Buffer we have both the Social blog and the Open blog  and now our Medium publication   where we regularly publish content  There are a few ways I work with the editors of these blogs   Coordinating product launches  such as Instagram reposting  together for messaging and a quick pitch  as well as the timing that announcement will go live and the press pitching can start or embargo can lift  Crafting  brainstorming pieces that will be interesting to our syndication partners  syndication falls under PR at Buffer   For example  some partners prefer X ways to do X  whereas other want deep dives into how we think about things at Buffer and it s always helpful to coordinate this with our various editors   From the culture side with the Open blog  we work together to take new and unique company culture  transparency developments and workplace experiments and share them on the blog and then with the press  Our recent change to having minimum vacation is one example   PR   Data  We re luck to have a whole team of fantastic Data Analysts at Buffer  They offer various time spots for office hours so our whole team can learn more about the different areas of data we might be interested in  I work closely with the Data Analysts on a couple of things    Our first Marketing brainstorm where we were able to get all timezones in for 2016       Beyond marketing  How PR fits in with all of Buffer  Outside of the marketing team  working in PR also means collaborating with several different teams  Whether it s for a story or campaign  PR touches quite a few other areas   Employee morale   Getting recognition in

applications to work at Buffer   There s also lots of collaboration between PR and a few other teams   PR and Product  Something new about our product  Exciting  Is it press worthy  I ll bounce ideas around and think this through with our team   The product team also shares in advance any new features that might make a big splash so we can work on the plan ahead of time  The launch of Buffer s Instagram Reminders is a great example of when PR and Product worked closely together to make sure the product was ready to be shouted about  and that we were shouting the right things   PR and People  I also work closely with our People team  what we call human resources  to share new initiatives from a workplace culture  transparency or experiment perspective that could be of interest to the media   PR and Happiness  Our Happiness team  what we call customer service  has a lot going on on any given day  PR works with these folks to coordinate any incoming requests for interviews

You are building a product geared for other businesses  You ve talked to potential users  and you have your MVP  You ve been working on a few enterprise deals for some months now  and you ve been introduced to some of the execs  But the timing doesn t seem right  you can t convince them to move forward  and you are missing some of features that they are asking about   Money s running out  and you ve yet to gain any traction  What now   That was us three years ago   The Enterprise Cycle  Today at Shippo  we power shipping for over 10 000 merchants and enterprises  We ve built an API that connects businesses of all sizes to shipping carriers to help them purchase shipping labels and track packages   When we first started selling our shipping API  we focused our efforts on a few enterprise businesses  Since enterprise companies have more shipping volume  we d only need to land a few to hit our growth tracts   However  enterprise companies have long sales cycles  For an integration to proceed  there must be alignment in timing  gaining credibility  and going through procurement  Enterprises also do their due diligence  Sometimes  due diligence comes in the form of a RFI  But more often  it s about getting together with the right stakeholders and making sure that you have the right people to vouch for you   The long sales and implementation cycle in enterprise was killing us   To keep Shippo going  we needed one thing before the money ran out  the shipping volume to earn revenue that would make Shippo sustainable and allow us to gain credibility with enterprise companies   So we dropped enterprise and turned to the small medium business market  SMBs   which goes against some of the common wisdom of landing a few marquee clients before focusing on the long tail   The SMB Pivot  According to the U S  Small Business Administration  there are two widely used size standards for small medium businesses   500 employees for most manufacturing and mining industries and  7 5 million in average annual receipts  GMV  for many nonmanufacturing industries    This meant that we had to work with a lot of small businesses in order to hit our volume goals   Using our API  we built Shippo apps on platforms such as Shopify  Magento  and Etsy  We also created a web based shipping dashboard to allow merchants to compare shipping rates  print shipping labels  track packages  and manage orders   We found that SMBs had a much shorter sales cycle  Since their operations are smaller  there is less red tape  Only a few individuals were needed to make a decision often it was the same person implementing it and using it   Another typical trait amongst SMB merchants was their willingness to trying new things  Especially if the business was small  a merchant can onboard with a few competing products at the same time to get a feel of something before committing  To help with the onboarding process  we learned it was important to offer an easy integration process and comprehensive documentation   Rapid Feedback  Unlike enterprise clients  the churn among SMBs was high  To reduce churn  we had to create stickiness with our shipping app  which we did by offering discounted shipping rates and shipment tracking services synced directly to their storefronts  Within a few months  we became the top shipping app on popular platforms like Shopify   With the fast sales cycle and a large number of customers  we were able to quickly test assumptions and build the product  both the dashboard  but especially the API  based on rapid feedback from SMBs  By the time we built up a runway and started approaching enterprises again  we had already went through many of iterations and scaled our API to support the volume it needed to handle bigger clients   Today  we think about growth like this   The long sales cycles are not an issue anymore as we continue to grow organically with SMBs  We now have a much easier time selling to enterprises because we have good product market fit  brand  and credibility  With diversity of revenue  we ve become significantly more stable as a business no one customer can have a material impact on our revenues   We believe the the key to growing as a B2B business is to find and continuously adjust the balance between SMBs and enterprise sales  You shouldn t have to choose one over the other  it s about how you handle each  what you re getting out of supporting each type of customer  and how you invest your resources  Fine tuning the process and creating sustainable growth with SMBs can help propel you a long way

1185,training-dataset/business/128.txt,business,How to price anything   The Startup   MediumHow to price anything The psychology behind what we ll pay    How much should I charge for this    While talking about money might still be taboo in some circles  there s no way to get past the fact that your livelihood depends on charging for the work you do and the products you ve made   But  value  is one of those complex terms that gets thrown around in such a simple way  but is actually incredibly complex when you get into it   Many people fall into the trap of following the Labor Theory of Value  thinking that the value of a service is determined by the amount of labor that goes into its production  It s why we re willing to spend  12 on a jar of jam because it s labeled as  artisan  or  craftsman   We assume the  artist  put in more work than a  manufacturer    On the other end of the spectrum are those saying that value is in the eye of the buyer  and if someone is willing to pay what you re charging  then that s a valid price    500 for a webinar  Sure  why not  X company charged that   9 99 a month  Sounds good  That s like 2 expensive coffees   But what our armchair analysis of value fails to recognize is that miss the mark on pricing either way and you just might kill your business   Smart pricing is deliberate  It takes into account all of the work you ve done to understand your audience and build your business and crafts an offer than feels honest  acceptable  and most of all  valuable   But how do we get there  While so much of it will depend on your business model and research  there are some enduring studies that can help us understand just what someone sees when they look at your price tag   1  What you see is what you want  Thanks to a human tendency called anchoring  when it comes to displaying a price  what you see first is what you want in the end   Anchoring or focalism is a cognitive bias that says we rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered  the  anchor   when making a decision  If you re negotiating or justifying a transaction and see  20 first  you re more likely to end up closer to  20 than  30 in the end   So how do you use this to your advantage   In one seemingly counterintuitive example  an analyst at McKinsey found that when a semiconductor manufacturer put out a new product  instead of lowering the price of the older offering  like most of us would   they raised it  Not only did they make additional profits off selling old stock  but keeping the anchor price high made new buyers more likely to pay the amount asked for a new product   There s always a moment of doubt when raising your rate or price  but know that the higher you start  the higher you ll end up   2  How your price sounds  and looks  is incredibly important  There are numerous studies into how the presentation of a price affects how we feel about it  Tiny nuances can change whether someone believes you re providing them with value or not   Here s a few of my favourites   Choose  odd  numbers  One of the oldest tricks in the book  yet it still works  People call this  Charm pricing  and it s the positive feeling that happens when the left most digit changes  Our brains encode a price with the first digit we see  so a change from  9 99 to  9 19 won t really matter  but go form  9 01 to  8 99 and all of a sudden there is a perceived value change   One of the oldest tricks in the book  yet it still works  People call this  Charm pricing  and it s the positive feeling that happens when the left most digit changes  Our brains encode a price with the first digit we see  so a change from  9 99 to  9 19 won t really matter  but go form  9 01 to  8 99 and all of a sudden there is a perceived value change  Say it out loud  In a paper published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology  researchers found that prices that contained more syllables seemed drastically higher to consumers  This is thanks to how we read a number and its  fluency   The harder a number is to  say  the worse we feel about it  So  1 999 99  one thousand  nine hundred  ninety nine  and ninety nine cents  feels more expensive than  1999  nineteen ninety nine   The more syllables  the more we think it costs   In a paper published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology  researchers found that prices that contained more syllables seemed drastically higher to consumers  This is thanks to how we read a number and its  fluency   The harder a number is to  say  the worse we feel about it  So  1 999 99  one thousand  nine hundred  ninety nine  and ninety nine cents  feels more expensive than  1999  nineteen ninety nine   The more syllables  the more we think it costs  People love physically small numbers  Studies have shown that placing your price in the bottom of a page rather than the top makes people perceive it as lower  Even crazier  the physical size of your font can influence peoples  understanding and feelings about it  Smaller fonts seem smaller in price    Thanks to processing fluency  people will perceive your price to be smaller if you display that price in a smaller font  This tactic is particularly effective when you contrast your price with a larger sized reference price    When you re going for the big sale  be as exact as possible  When researchers at Cornell University buyers pay more money when prices are specific  e g    362 978 vs   350 000   And while you might think this is to help with negotiation  what the researchers uncovered was that it was actually due to how we perceive numbers  Think about when you are most likely to use a precise number  Most likely when you re dealing with smaller values  And even though you re spending hundreds of thousands of dollars or more  that perception persists   3  Spending hurts  Reduce the pain   Have you ever felt buyer s remorse  That sudden feeling after a purchase that you ve made a terrible  terrible mistake   Buying good and services may feel good eventually  but we all suffer from a moment of purchase pain at the moment of transaction due to the fact that we ve made a decision to do something now that will effect what we can do in the future  we paid  20 for something  which means we don t have that  20 for other spending    In a study from MIT and Carnegie Mellon University  researchers found that this pain emerges from two factors   The saliency of the payment  e g   we feel more pain if we see money leaving our hands  The timing of the payment  e g   we feel more pain if we pay after we consume   So how can you change your pricing structure to relieve pain  Think about Uber   In a traditional taxi you watch as a meter ticks up  higher and higher  during your ride and then have to physically fork over cash at the end of the trip  With Uber there s no meter and no visible transaction  Everything is out of sight and out of mind   Prepayment is a powerful way to keep buyers happy and satisfied with your service   4   Invisibly  raise your price  We all want to make the most we can  but what if there was a way to raise your prices without your customers noticing   Weber s Law says that the the change in a stimulus that will be just noticeable is a constant ratio of the original stimulus  What does that mean  Basically that all changes  including price  are relative to their starting point  The most simple example is that you have to yell to be heard in a loud room but a whisper will do in a quiet one   Sounds basic  right  But what this also means is that there s a threshold from the original stimulus  such as your original price  where the change isn t noticeable   Marketers swear by Weber s findings  and while there isn t a magical number  most people have settled on 10  as the amount that people start to notice  This means that you could potentially  creep  your price up 2   5   8  without most people noticing   It also means to make people stand up and notice a deal  you need to drop by more than 10    5  Don t compete on the lowest price  without adding context   The worst case scenario of competing on the lowest price is that you win  The second worst is you don t   While going toe to toe with the competition means you might  win  the market  studies from Stanford have found that comparative pricing can actually have a negative effect if you don t give people a good enough reason to compare prices  Without context  you re asking your customers to make explicit comparisons of your product and a competitors  which in turn can cause them to lose trust in what you re saying   The Stanford researchers found that without context as to why your price is the lowest  the mere fact that you re asking a customer to make a comparison causes them to fear they re being tricked in some way,"[1185 700 339 1293 561 266 154 1316 232 987 537]"
1189,training-dataset/business/1423.txt,business,Rebranding a SaaS startupIn a fast paced SaaS startup  branding is crucial for establishing an identity within a crowded marketplace  It helps to build a relationship with your customers  and it s a great way of showing who you are and the product service you re offering   So  what if you ve built a successful brand  and you realize you need to change everything about it   Cue mass panic   That s exactly what we did in 2016 when we rebranded our company from Receiptful to Conversio with only 1 designer on a team of 14   Why rebrand   Some history  Back in 2014  Receiptful was born  Our goal was to help ecommerce store owners replace their default receipts with receipts that looked better  as well as add incentives like discount coupons and refer a friend links to help increase customer lifetime value   As the company grew  we started to add lots of new features  such as abandoned cart emails  newsletters  and even search and recommendations widgets   But we had a problem  We offered a whole range of marketing tools for ecommerce stores  but our company name still kept us firmly in the receipt business  Our brand no longer reflected our values   We had to change  so in 2016 we rebranded as Conversio  Here s how we did it   Step 1  Determining our core values  Whether you can see it  all brands have a strong list of core values behind them   Related  How to discover your team s core values  These core values are designed to help define a company both internally and externally   How your team lives and breathes everything about your product  How customers view and interact with you  Back in 2015  while our entire team met up for a retreat  we decided it was time to create our own values   Honesty   we re always honest with our customers and ourselves Passion   we love what what we do and show that in our product Independence   we re decision  and location independent  we run our business in our own way Curiosity   we re always trying out new things and ways of helping our customers Rebellion   we re never afraid to take big leaps  After aligning ourselves to these values  we started to see changes in the way we worked  We questioned ourselves more and tried to come up with better and more unique solutions to problems   These values are integral to our company  so they were a great starting point for redefining our brand   Step 2  The name  As a small startup  our brand and name are vital to our recognition within a crowded marketplace   We d had great success with our original name  Receiptful  because the name made it clear that we offered supercharged receipts for ecommerce stores   When we expanded our range of products  that name just didn t work any more  We needed a name that aligned with our target market  helped to inform customers of the services we offered  and was easy to remember   We started the renaming process by asking the team to help come up with suggestions about a new name and why they felt it worked  We created a spreadsheet and wrote down the names  along with the reasoning behind each one   After a few rounds of ideas and deliberating  we narrowed down our choices to Conversio   Step 3  Take a step back  After choosing a name  the designer in me wanted to start doodling immediately we crave the ability to show how something looks and feels   But I didn t   I decided to get to the core of our new name what it meant for us as a company and for our customers  In Latin  the word Conversio means  a turning round  revolving  revolution    Let s break that down into its 3 parts   A turning around Revolving Revolution  Each part of the definition looks the same  but they can mean very different things  I grabbed some synonyms for each of the definitions in order to help collect some keywords about our new name   A turning around   Adapt  Adjust  Customize  Reshape  Tweak  Vary Revolving   Rotate  Roll  Spin  Turn Around  Twist Revolution   Shift  Transform  Cycle  Orbit  Change  What words mattered most to us and our customers  I landed on Adapt  Customize  Turn Around  Shift  Transform  Change   These were the most important words for us because they symbolized exactly what we wanted to achieve for our customers  to transform and change their ecommerce marketing  with adaptable and customizable software that would help shift more products and help turn around to become more successful   All of this seemed like a simple word exercise  but it really helped us as a company focus on who we are and how we want to be seen  And it eventually helped us come up with a simple tagline  Conversio  Sell More  Do Less   Step 4  Get the crayons out  Now that we had the name and the beginnings of what that meant for us and our customers  I started to think about how the brand should look and feel  I found the best way to start was to look at what our competitors were doing   I wanted to get a sense of how our competitors were communicating within a similar customer base  what seemed to work well  and what could be improved upon  It helped me clarify those important customer touch points and remain firmly within our target market with the added simplicity and friendly tone we like convey to our customers   Once I knew all that  I looked solely at the word conversio  What do we think about when we hear it   For me  it all boiled down to converting or changing something from one thing into another  So  I started to play with ideas around symbolizing conversions and changing  and I found that arrows play a crucial role in graphically representing how something changes from one thing to another  take a recycling logo  for example    I needed to get my crayons out as soon as possible  so next I looked at colors and the psychology behind why certain colors work for certain brands  Taking some of our synonyms from before  I found that green was the most useful color for us  It feels positive  helps convey growth and trust  and it s generally associated with stability and wealth   Lastly  I needed to find a font   Related  Designers  favorite typefaces  With our old Receiptful logo  it was hard to read the company name when the logo was small  The old font was hand drawn and then vectorized  so it also meant that the brand always felt a little disjointed from the UI it was placed upon   I then had 3 goals with a font choice   Make it stand out  Make it work at all sizes  Make it feel part of the UI of the app and website  I eventually went with Poppins  a bold  Swiss style font that works well at different sizes   Now I just had to put it all together  Simple  right  Well  this part of the process took weeks trying lots of different layouts and positions   Until   Step 5  Present to your team  So  confession time   I did all of this work without telling anyone on my team that I was doing it    But why  Adam    I m glad you asked   If you communicate with your team on a chat platform like Slack  you may have noticed that opinions and thoughts can come thick and fast when you re proposing something  and it can be hard to focus on something when the topic of conversation can quickly change   So I decided to build a presentation  A few reasons why   Presentations help everyone focus on their own time on one specific topic Presentations keep the conversation relevant  as everyone is on the same page after reading Presentations help convey a sense of excitement around a rebrand Presentations let me use even more animated GIFs in content  When I sent the presentation to the team  it not only helped keep our conversations relevant and precise  but it really brought everyone on board with the rebrand  Plus  it didn t just feel like a designer playing with paint in the corner   More importantly  though  this also laid the foundation for Adii Pienaar  Conversio founder  to create his own slide deck that laid out our new business strategy  aptly titled Breaking Bad  you can learn more here    The goal with the rebranding and new Breaking Bad strategy was to better align everything we were saying  thinking  and doing to our core values   In announcing our new brand to the public  Adii said    The monetary or marketing success of our rebrand is however very much a byproduct of us doing something very simple  Do Things  Tell Others    So if you re thinking about rebranding or just improving your existing branding in an effort to level up your business  here are a couple of things to consider   Should you rebrand   Designers love redesigns and rebrands because  new  shiny objects  More often than not  complete overhauls aren t necessary and incremental  iterative changes are a better option  What helped us decide to rebrand   Our brand confused our customers because there was a gap between what the brand suggested and the product offered  This created a lot of friction for us in explaining our product value to new customers  which hindered our business goals  Our brand had not evolved and grown at the same pace as the team itself  It felt a little stale in the way that it didn t represent our core values and most passionate ideas anymore  We also discussed keeping our existing name and just redesigning everything about ourselves  the product  our website  the logo  and all of our messaging  We didn t feel that this would ve given us the desired outcome  but from a cost benefit perspective this was a good discussion for us to have   How could you improve your brand   This is something we re clear about  our brand can t just be about the things we design and say  our brand is about what we do and the types of humans we are in our everyday actions   We ve experienced that when our actions align perfectly with every aspect of our business  sales  marketing  customer support  product development  etc    We start building authentic and powerful relationships with both prospective and existing customers   The simplest way to think about improving your brand  then  is to continuously keep everything about your brand and activities in close alignment  Think about your core values and most passionate ideas   Are you living and communicating those things in every customer interaction  How does your marketing website s messaging compare to your conversations with customers on sales calls or in answering support tickets  If there s a big difference in these things  then that s the best place to refine your branding   Similarly  how does the new product feature release compare with your help documentation  Is it obvious that you put your heart and soul into designing a beautiful new feature  but that the help documentation almost seems like a sloppy afterthought  What does this say about your brand   Before we got to the point of releasing and leveraging our new brand  the rebranding process helped us clarify and define the things that were most important to us  as well as the things that will drive us forward   Today Conversio is a better company for that,"[1189 1169 782 51 97 154 595 561 723 327 1145]"
1200,training-dataset/business/387.txt,business,Your CAC Math Is Wrong  TooA few months ago  I wrote a blog post warning entrepreneurs that their LTV math was wrong  In other words  their methodology for calculating the lifetime value of a customer was incorrect and  typically  a grossly optimistic figure  It got a lot of attention and even inspired a new module in InsightSquared to help companies do the correct calculation   In talking about getting these kinds of calculations correct  one of my portfolio company CEOs made an interesting observation to me  We were talking about our customer acquisition costs  CAC   which represents the other side of the unit economics coin  The company is converging on profitability and is thus getting more and more focused on its unit economics and CAC    Our historical CAC is obviously irrelevant   he declared in the board meeting   All that matters is our marginal CAC   This struck me as such an important insight that I would try to unpack it a bit because  as with LTV  most entrepreneurs think about their CAC incorrectly   Many entrepreneurs calculate CAC by simply adding the amount of money they spend on sales and marketing and then dividing it by the number of customers that they have  If last quarter you spent  100 000 in sales and marketing and you acquired 10 customers  your CAC is  10k  A hypothetical consumer company may spend  100 000 in sales and marketing to acquired 50 000 customers to achieve a CAC of  2   That simple math may be historically accurate but it s not very helpful as a planning framework  The historical customer count in a consumer company  for example  typically contains customers that came in through a range of sources   paid  e g   SEM  SEO  Facebook  and unpaid  e g   organic   Some of these tactics are highly scalable and others are not  Some may even have reverse economies of scale and  thus  actually get worse with scale   Customer acquisition is a bit like drilling for oil  Sometimes you hit a gusher and it flows beautifully  but eventually that well runs dry and you need to find another one  Similarly  you may come upon a particular customer acquisition tactic and it might be working beautifully and with favorable economics  but eventually it runs its course and you need to deploy another tactic   That s where the concept of  marginal CAC  really matters  as my portfolio company CEO wisely observed  When looking ahead  you want to know what the cost is of the next set of customers that you re trying to acquire  That is  what is the acquisition cost of the marginal customer  If the only tactic you can scale is Facebook ads  then the marginal cost of acquisition of Facebook ads matters more when forecasting your future CAC  not the blended average that you ve been able to achieve historically   An e commerce entrepreneur we were speaking with the other day cited a historical customer acquisition cost of  150  The CEO then projected that those costs would decline with time   a perfectly logical assertion  As part of our due diligence  we asked for how the numbers broke down by acquisition channel and discovered that the  150 was a blend of organic and paid channels and that the only paid channel that would scale going forward represented an expensive  300 CAC  Thus  their marginal CAC was most likely to be going up over time with scale  not down   The lesson  As we head into an era of savvier investors who scrutinize unit economics more thoroughly  don t get caught looking naive when presenting your CAC projections   make sure you re thinking about marginal costs  not just historical ones,"[1200 775 289 1327 406 609 985 561 723 154 232]"
1204,training-dataset/product/941.txt,product,Understanding your users  mental modelIf you want to understand how someone thinks your product works  give them a pencil and ask them to draw you a diagram  A simple sketch can transport you inside someone else s head better than any other product research technique  Sketching is awesome at helping us construct new ideas and communicate them to others  It s no coincidence that many product designers  software of choice for constructing their ideas is called  Sketch   This post is not about that type of Sketch  This post is about a really overlooked aspect of sketching  Sketching is an amazing technique to deconstruct the way another person thinks about how something works  more commonly known as their mental model  As a product researcher  it s my job to understand how people think about things  and that s why I m excited about the power of sketching as a means of deconstructing what s in someone s head  I delivered a talk on the power of sketch research at the Inside Intercom world tour earlier this year  The video and slides are embedded below  Scroll down to read more about how you can apply sketch research to your own product  It turns out that psychologists have been using sketching as a window into people s minds for years  from the House Tree Person test to evaluate intelligence and brain damage  to art therapy with young children who have experienced trauma  Sketches can be very simple and lo fidelity but communicate a huge amount of important information about how someone feels and thinks about something  They can even communicate feelings and traumatic experiences that go beyond the language of the person drawing  Sketching for Product Research If you want to design amazing products that feel intuitive to your users  you first have to understand how the users of your product think  So the fact that a sketch can take you right inside someone else s mind means it can be a really useful product research technique  When you understand how your users think and what their mental models are  then you re better placed to design something that feels really intuitive for them  Digital products that lend themselves particularly well to sketch research involve  Spatial relationships  e g  maps  local search   People and relationships between people  e g  Facebook  Snapchat   Time and Sequences  e g  Path  Moves   Complex systems  e g  Health insurance  Salesforce   Here are three case studies that illustrate in more detail how sketch research can help you understand your users better  1  How people think about spatial relationships Back in 2008  I was leading user research for Google mobile search  The iPhone hadn t been around for long  it launched in June 2007  and local search on mobile was a very nascent product  One of the common assumptions back then was that raw physical distance between the mobile search user and the local place they were searching for  e g  dry cleaner  would be pivotal to how users selected which dry cleaner to go to from a list of local results  To understand how people thought about local search information  I first wanted to understand how people thought about their  local  area  the familiar places they went to most and the places they were most interested in seeking new information about  So I got people who owned iPhones to draw simple sketch maps of the places they went in a typical week and got them to talk me through their maps  Some interesting patterns started to emerge  One common trend was that many people in the study moved around their local environment in a kind of  dog bone  pattern  At one end of the dog bone there was home  at the other end was work  and the distance in between was their commute  The places they were interested in going to shop  eat  and run errands  were heavily focused within their dog bone zone   Unlike the assumptions of many of the team  the users spent very little time exploring other places  Like other mammals  they stuck to well trodden paths  They were not nearly as adventurous as was assumed  Rather than being interested in local information based on a circular zone around them  people were more interested in discovering new places  or retrieving information about known places  that were located within their local dog bone zone instead  Once you understand how people think about their local environment and relate to things in it  you can make your local products better for them  In the years that followed  for example  Google launched a feature that allows you to save Home and Work locations  This makes getting directions and commute information for your  dog bone  much faster  You can also search along the route that you ve asked Google Mobile Maps directions for  so you can run errands more conveniently along your route  2  How people think about people and their relationship with them Paul Adams  our VP of Product  was also a user researcher at Google  Back in 2008 he wanted to understand people s mental model of their relationships with their friends  so he got them to sketch out a friend map  He said   I d like you to draw a map of your friends  Draw yourself in the middle  Add friends one by one  with the closest friends nearest to you on the map  After that  you can add friends however you like    His research revealed that unlike the dominant Facebook model at the time  people didn t have one big  equal group of  friends   Instead they have many different circles of friends in real life and wanted their online social tools to support those different groups  This had huge implications for social products  sharing models  and privacy  Google designed G  Circles based on this insight  Facebook redesigned their Groups product to support more categorization of friends  It s easy to look back at these old examples and think it must have been obvious  but these insights would have taken a lot longer to reach without the sketches  3  How people think a complex system works We strive for simplicity when we design every aspect of Intercom  But behind that simplicity is a lot of complexity  We used sketch research with our coworkers to understand how people at Intercom thought about how Intercom works as a system  We had noticed we weren t always using the same terminology to describe our product  and this was creating some confusion internally  We decided to conduct internal research to find out what our coworkers  mental models of Intercom were  We didn t have a common mental model of Intercom  So the Research team interviewed our coworkers and asked them that simple question   How do you describe how Intercom works    We got them to draw this on a sheet of paper and talk us through it  What we found was not only were we using different terminology  but we were thinking about the product in entirely different ways  We realized we didn t have a common mental model of Intercom  meaning we weren t explaining how it worked in the same way  The diversity of these drawings was a catalyst for us  prompting us to create a clear system model of how Intercom actually works  This will ensure that everyone at Intercom can get on the same page  and make sure when we onboard new employees they are thinking about Intercom as a system in the same way too  Getting started with sketch research A really common question is  How do I get someone to start sketching    Here s some advice about how to craft your questions  First  decide what you re trying to understand at a high level  Perhaps you want to understand  How people think about navigating from A to B  How people think about the steps in a process  How people think about how different objects interact in a system Next  you need to write a few clear  open ended questions that will prompt your research participant to start sketching something relevant for you,"[1204 691 154 561 610 488 985 821 609 542 836]"

1279,training-dataset/business/1201.txt,business,How 16 Companies are Dominating the World s Google Search Results13 minutes  In the Academy Award nominated film Food Inc  filmmaker Robert Kenner reveals how the varied choice of items we see on the shelves of supermarkets is actually a false presumption  Instead  that seemingly endless variety is actually controlled by just a handful of companies   Today I m going to reveal how the huge diversity we perceive in Google search results is once again a few large corporations controlling what we assume to be choice  More specifically I ll reveal how just 16 core companies are dominating the most popular industries online and how that situation is going to get a whole lot worse     To begin our journey down the rabbit hole together  I want to take you through a series of events which uncovered something I had never considered before about the industry in which I operate  Are the Google rankings I aim to get for myself and my clients actually controlled by just three hands full of companies   Around two weeks ago I came across a post on Reddit about Hearst Media  I was unfamiliar with Hearst Media but very familiar with the brands they own such as Esquire  Elle and Cosmopolitan   The Reddit outing  which was shared on a new account  claimed that Hearst were using their powerful brands to  game Google  and rank a new website of theirs very quickly  using slightly shady practices   Being an inquisitive marketer I had to check it out for myself  The quick summary is that Hearst clearly were  and still are  using their authoritative brands to point links to their latest venture  BestProducts com   While I expected BestProducts com to be receiving a lot of traffic from the brands linking to them   which also include Marie Claire and Woman s Day   I didn t expect Google to have taken such a huge liking to them  Especially when the site in question had zero reason prior to be ranking so well  it was owned previously then the domain dropped a few years ago    To give an overview of what was happening for those who are skimming this article  the situation looks like this   The arrows in this picture represent links   There are far more brands involved in this network  but we ll get to those in a second   As I stated earlier  I was far more surprised by how Google reacted to this   Launched in October  They Now Receive More than 600 000 Visitors from Google Per Month  Here s the graph that kick started the countless days of research I did for this blog post   As we can see  the estimated traffic to BestProducts has shot up dramatically in the last few months  SEMRush is showing similar numbers  as we ll get to in a second  With 62  of their traffic estimated to be coming from Google  that s at least 600 000 organic  free  website visitors for the month of April   I expect the data for May will be significantly higher  but I have to wait until June 10th to see  that s when SimilarWeb confirm they ll update their reporting    So Why Am I Surprised   Tons of authoritative sites linking to you is obviously great for SEO   But as anyone who has been involved in search engine optimisation for a period of time might wonder  surely getting so many sitewide links in a short timeframe should raise a bit of a red flag   Even if the links in question are from some of the biggest media brands in the world   Here s a few examples   Esquire com  Product Reviews   Elle com  Beauty Reviews   Cosmopolitan com  Beauty Reviews   MarieClaire com  Reviews   PopularMechanics com  Product Reviews   Now  I will say that 90  of me thinks there is absolutely nothing wrong with this  In fact  you ll see the majority of this post is focused on why I m surprised Google give the resulting website so much traffic   Quite simply if I owned a lot of websites  I would be fine linking them together  If for nothing more than from a usability standpoint   That being said  10  of me is a little surprised that these link texts and locations are constantly changing  I think it s a bit risky on their part   As of publishing this post  Cosmopolitan use  Beauty Reviews  as the anchor text of their footer to the site  Previously it was in a different placement and used the anchor text  Style Reviews    These are not static footer links that have been left alone  and not just on one site   They re changing to different pages   and using different words   on a fairly frequent basis   To me this takes the situation away from  they re just linking to their own site  to  they re doing a lot of tweaking to see which results in higher rankings   You could argue they re testing it for usability reasons  but you ll see in a moment why I think they know a thing or two about SEO   Before I get into that  I wanted to see if I could figure out when these links were added to their network   Were they all thrown up at once and it took a while for them to have an impact  or was there some clear plan behind the links from Hearst Media s various brands   Here s some of the data I managed to uncover on when each site first linked to BestProducts  I bolded those that linked on the same day    PopularMechanics com   November 5th  Esquire com   November 5th  Cosmopolitan com   January 1st  Seventeen com   January 12th  RedbookMag com   February 23rd  Elle com   March 15th  CountryLiving com   March 18th  WomansDay com   April 5th  MarieClaire com   April 5th  RoadandTrack com   April 13th  For my own curiosity  I was glad I took the time to trawl through every screenshot on Archive org to find these answers  It s now obvious that the people working for Woman s Day  Marie Claire  Popular Mechanics and Esquire had some conversion that went along the lines of   Don t forget  today s the day we have to put those links to Best Products in the footer    As I said earlier  I don t really care too much about what Hearst media are doing with their  link network  of magazine brands  I don t see anything wrong with it and don t think Google should either   That being said  because I ve done more research for this blog post than any other  I do want to add that they purchased the most successful SEO agency on the planet just a few years ago   If you can t read that because of my small post width  I m working on a redesign   they paid  325 million for an agency that generated more than 60  of their revenues from SEO clients   At the time of acquisition iCrossing were also the biggest search agency in the world based on revenue numbers  In other words  the staff at Hearst Media comprises of a large number of people who know a lot about SEO   To me this explains the slow buildup of network links and the semi frequent changing of URL s and link text in their website footer   I Have No Problem With What Hearst Are Doing  Google s Reaction Is What Really Interests Me   I ve said it a few times but I ll say it once more for anyone skimming the post  This is by no means an attack on Hearst Media  They own the websites so they re welcome to do with them as they please  They also made BestProducts a rather attractive looking website   Then again  I m surprised at how well their strategy is working  I m not naive   I know that authoritative links equal a good chance of increased search rankings   but I didn t expect they would be outranking some of the biggest brands on the internet for search terms that can make them a lot of money   From Zero to  583 000 in Free Search Traffic  We ve already looked at the data from SimilarWeb  but the stats from SEMRush are interesting as well   SEMRush pips BestProducts at ranking for over half a million dollar s worth of search queries  if you were to buy them via Google Adwords  in a very short space of time   Their Top Keywords According to SEMRush  Some of those incredible rankings they ve achieved include   hairstyles  11th  450 0000 searches per month    450 0000 searches per month  short hairstyles  7th  301 000 searches per month    301 000 searches per month  best wireless earbuds  1st  22 200 searches per month    22 200 searches per month  short haircuts  9th  301 000 searches per month    301 000 searches per month  best running shoes for women  1st  18 100 searches per month    18 100 searches per month  bluetooth speakers  11th  165 000 searches per month    165 000 searches

searches per month    165 000 searches per month  short haircuts for women  6th  110 000 searches per month   They re still ranking for these terms  which is why I predict the SimilarWeb traffic graph will increase a lot when they update their data for May   Their Top Keywords According to SimilarWeb  It s interesting to see how different the data from SimilarWeb and SEMRush seems to be  but they re at least right that BestProducts are ranking for what they state they re ranking for   best dishwasher 2016  best smartwatch 2016  best gaming headset 2016  best action camera 2016  best bluetooth speaker 2016  Hey  I did tell you all just before new year that you should be writing 2016 everywhere on your site   I could make this page infinitely scrollable if I show all of their rankings  so I ll just share a couple to show they really do rank   While they aren t a top result for this one it does show that they re likely still getting hundreds of clicks per day for just one search term   It s certainly not just with BestProducts that Hearst are having a lot of SEO success though  Just look at how their brand is doing as a whole   Hearst Alone Absolutely Dominate Certain Sectors of Google Search Results  Worried about ranking top three  Why not just take all of the spots   Sadly  Google Search Results Will Never Look Diverse Again  At least not to me   You may think Hearst are some kind of exception and partly  you would be right  However  they re certainly not alone   Purch also own some of the biggest sites online   They all already link to each other in the footer of every site  but it s my understanding that they were all fairly big  brands  on their own before being purchased  Just look at the traffic numbers for some of those sites   Toms Hardware   51 million visitors per month  Top Ten Reviews   17 5 million visitors per month  Live Science   20 6 million visitors per month  I don t have to go into their domain stats  you already know they have authority   Purch and Hearst compete in many of the same industries and one of Purch s sites   TopTenReviews   also ranks in my screenshot above for the dishwashers search query   There s no doubt they are watching the success of one of their bigger rivals and if they see that they can spin off new web properties into valuable entities  it must be very tempting to follow the same path   Sadly  the more research I did for this post  the less and less varied Google search results appeared to be  Time after time I was able to trace back the top ranking websites to some of the biggest media companies in the world   There are of course some I m missing  especially outside of the English language  but these are the companies I found most often in search results across the board     Click here to view a slightly larger image   To show you I m not being dramatic  let s take a look at some actual search results I believe that these networks are dominating  They re not just limited to one sector   They ve Taken Over Software  That s a little bit of a long tail example  so let s look at something far more popular   They ve Taken Over Food    Image results were manually removed from this screenshot for clarity  And another     For this screenshot I removed some Google images so I could fit in the search results  They ve Taken Over Technology  I m starting to feel like I was one of the only people who didn t know about these brands   They ve definitely got a big hold on the technology industry   They ve Taken Over Gaming    Note  One Youtube result was removed from this graphic so I could fit in the screenshot  They ve Taken Over Health  They ve Taken Over Automotive  They ve Taken Over Beauty  They Buy Out the Competition  They  More than Likely  Share Keyword Data Across Their Network  I can t blame them for doing this  but it s certainly interesting to see   It s not only the big broad keywords that send a lot of traffic they can share either  If you have similar brands  you should definitely be taking advantage of the long tail   Why have one top search result when you can have two  or many more    These Companies Get  20 000 in Links Just for Buying a Domain Name  When Google search results are so reliant on one thing then we re all a little bit at the mercy of whoever has the most money to throw at the problem   Whenever these big brands start a new website the tech and news blogs share it with the world  and that means link acquisition   Hearst s Best Product Got Incredible Links On the Day of Launch  Here is Racked com  ironically owned by another of the sixteen  talking about their new brand   As Did Time s New Breakfast Site  Even if you re just writing about the first meal of the day  it s notable to those in the tech space   As Did IAC s New Health Site  There are few better links to get about a new brand than a mention from TechCrunch   It s Clear That Domain Authority is More Important Than Ever  If you didn t  catch  on to this after seeing how well BestProducts are ranking then let me make it clear  There are almost no backlinks from other sites pointing to the top ranking pages of BestProducts com   They do have some internal links   mostly from the footer of PopularMechanics articles   but very few  However  they have a ton of strong links pointing to their homepage and category pages  which is spreading the  link juice  around their entire website   This is inline with what Brian Dean reported when he analysed 1 000 000 Google search results   As he says   In other words  the domain that your page lives on is more important than the page itself    Overall  it makes sense that domain authority plays a big role in overall site rankings  it s not easy to get internal links  but I m surprised to see it being so important   How IAC s About com Used Their Authority to Catapult a New Site to the Top of Google  When TechCrunch covered the launch of About com s new standalone health website  Very Well  they had this to say regarding their SEO   One of the greater challenges for About com will be SEO  The company current has pretty good juice when it comes to Google searches  and launching on a new domain with a new brand could prove difficult to migrate   The other interesting thing they quoted  which a lot of other news sites picked up on  was that   Verywell will launch with more than 50 000 pieces of content ranging from common medical conditions like diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis to simple health tips like how to get more sleep or advice on fitness   That s a lot of content for a brand new site   50 000 Pages of Content Did Nothing for Their SEO   From what I can tell  Very Well seemed to come online around February of this year  The first mentions or evidence of the site didn t appear until April  but some of their older content has February 2016 as the publish date   Now the day they launched the site   whatever that really means   was April 26th  2016  That means they added 50 000 pieces of content to a dropped domain in the space of two months   During these two months not a single website analytics tool  such as SimilarWeb  Alexa or Compete  detected any traffic going to VeryWell com  Luckily  About com Has Some SEO Authority to Throw Around  As TechCrunch noted  About com are one of the most SEO authoritative brands in the world  It seems like no matter what you search for  they ll be there ranking on the first page of Google   It s interesting then that About com decided to risk that authority by pointing their health related sub domains straight to Verywell com  as shown below   This is just a sample of those I found  There are many more   To be clear  these sub domains used to have sites on them  They re not just randomly redirecting  They were previously used by About com   WIth a wave of links from About com and the media web talking about IAC s new web brand  VeryWell started to get noticed on website analysis tools  Most notably by Ahrefs   That s a lot of links in a short period of time  Surely it must be setting off a few red flags like they did for Best Products com  Heh    How s That New Site Ranking  IAC   Very Well   If you want to know how this new brand is doing in Google  take a look for yourself   That s a recording of 3 6 million visitors to the site with 56  of that reportedly from free search engine traffic   IAC must be pleased with that  So much so in fact that I think this situation is only the tip of the iceberg   This Domination of Google Results Is Going to Get Much Worse  Over the last two weeks of dedicating day and night to this topic I found a lot of similarities in these mega brands   Many started offline in publishing and brought those titles online while many purchased their own competitors and ran different brands like they were separate entities  For instance  IAC purchased About com while AOL  now owned by Verizon  purchased Patch  TechCrunch and The Huffington Post   However  the most common thing I ve found in my research is that they all plan to spread the authority of their online presence   IAC s About com Will Disperse into Many More Verticals  Speaking with TechCrunch  their CEO Neil Vogel states   What we learned in rebuilding what we were is that we don t want to be that anymore  About was built during a different time in the internet  where scale translated to trust  But the internet has changed  No one wants advice on their 401k from the same people that give advice on how to bake a pie    As TechCrunch also note   Learning that  About has shifted its focus to building out verticals around its troves of topic specific content  with Verywell being the first   After seeing the quick SEO success of Very Well  I m sure they ll be bringing that plan forward   Time Have Already Spun Off into Two Verticals  Back in September of 2015  Time Inc s  The Foundry   sort of like their internal incubator  launched a car news website called The Drive  Time recently revealed the site is now receiving more than 2 million unique visitors per month   More recently  Time launched a website called Extra Crispy  Oddly enough it s a website dedicated to breakfast  but if you saw the screenshots above then you ll know they ve received a TON of links back to this site  simply because it was created by Time   Two of the 16 Are Teaming Up  Just last month  two of the sixteen brands I ve highlighted today actually acquired a new company together named Complex Media   The video focused company claim to reach more than 50 million unique visitors per month   With Verizon purchasing AOL last year for  4 4B  I wouldn t be overly surprised to see them make a few more content focused acquisitions   Cough  Verizon will buy Hearst  cough   Hearst Built BestProducts com in Just Six Weeks  I m not even talking about how long it took to get the content on the website  I m talking about sitting in a meeting one day and having the idea for the site to actually having it online and getting links from some of the most powerful domains in the world   Digiday reports that Hearst can move fast   We re now at place where we can spin up properties incredibly quickly   Young said   This went from idea to launch in six weeks    Young also commented that   We have a strong new platform  Now we can start applying that to new opportunities    Which to me can only mean that more BestProducts like websites are on their way   A Depressing Summary  but Not a Negative One  Though this post may seem like a bit of a  it s us against them  fight  that really wasn t my aim   The more research I did for this article and the more I realised certain brands were owned by the same company  the more I felt like I was watching Food Inc  the documentary that revealed the thousands of brands you see on supermarket shelves are really owned by just a handful of companies     Side note  If anyone has the skills to make a similar graphic with the brands I covered here I would include it  It s not too dissimilar from what I ve shared today  Thanks to Jason and Mary for putting this graphic together     Click here to view larger  As I ve always said  I write articles that I personally think would be interesting to read  In 11 years of immersing myself in the online marketing industry I ve never seen anyone talk about the huge dominance that certain players have on search results  So  as the research was interesting to me  I decided to share it   Let s take an ideal worldview for a second  If Google s ideals are to be believed  results from queries in their search engine should produce results that searchers want to find   For that reason  I m sure teenage American girls searching for advice on colours of eye liner aren t thinking  Ugh  really Google  Beauty tips from Vogue again    Similarly  when I m searching for tech product reviews  I m actually happy results from The Verge appear over some site I don t have much faith in  I trust The Verge  and I m more likely to click on their results than from anyone else   From an objective standpoint  the Google results are good  if not great  They provide what the searcher  and I  are looking for   But I m a marketer  If you re still reading this article  I can assume with 99  certainty that you re one too   As a marketer I learned how little Google care if a new site gets hundreds of thousands of links very quickly   I came away with even more belief in the importance of having a strong domain  read  a domain that has a lot of backlinks  if you want internal pages to rank   I also became a little fearful that these brands are going to spread into even more verticals  taking their already huge financial war chests and filling in all of the blank Google results they don t yet own   If we want to debate whether it s fair or not or whether Google should make changes  a court of law in the US has twice protected their search results under the First Amendment  Meaning it is totally up to them to list and rank websites wherever they wish   The first time they won a battle on their rankings  a company called CoastNews were suing them for  5M because they ranked at the top of Yahoo and Bing but were nowhere to be found on Google   At the end of the day  Google is a business that aims to make their shareholders money and if we as webmasters are looking to rank higher in Google  it s usually because we want to make more money as well  I can t feel it s unfair and want to profit from it at the same time  After all  I do have several niche agencies which profit from ranking other people highly in Google   I can complain   it s a shame Google can t detect some of what is going on here   but it s not going to change anything about how I run my business   All in all  I simply hope you found my findings as interesting in one go as I did while discovering them on the way   You Can Still Fight Back  Next week I ll be going live with a

1293,training-dataset/product/152.txt,product,Payment structure design and its impact on user behaviorHere s a question  as we close up Q1 of this year  how re you doing on your new year s resolutions  Like me  maybe one of your resolutions is to stay physically fit  So you make a pact to visit the gym regularly  I must admit that I dread going to the gym at the beginning of the new year  Why  Because it s crowded and I end up having to wait to use the machines that  at other times of the year  are readily available   If you have a gym membership  have you noticed this  annual  pattern  The gym is much more crowded at the beginning of the year than it is  say  in October or November  Is it all due to new year s resolutions  or is there something else at play  What if I told you that gym memberships are intentionally structured to generate their biggest profits later in the year  when the fewest people are working out   As UX professionals  we re often keenly interested in what drives usage  In this article  we ll look at a critical driver of usage patterns and why usage of products and services is important for customer retention and the health of your business   Timing is everything  Some time ago  researchers analyzed the usage patterns of 200 members of a health club in Colorado  where members could select from four possible payment plans  annual  semiannual  quarterly  and monthly  It turns out that those who made payments most frequently also had the best attendance  In fact  analysis of the data showed that usage patterns closely tracked whatever payment schedule a given member had selected  as shown below   Why would the payment schedule have such a significant impact on gym usage  Within the scope of this study  the reason was unclear  but a follow up experiment endeavored to unearth the answer to this question by presenting a hypothetical scenario to a variety of individuals to see how they would respond   Six months ago  you reserved a ticket to a theater event  Yesterday  you went to the box office and paid  50 for your ticket  which is nonrefundable  Today  you re feeling ill  Since the event is tonight  will you attend or stay home   Almost 60 percent of respondents said they would attend anyway  as they didn t want the ticket to be wasted  The researchers then presented a slightly different scenario to different group of individuals  The difference in the second scenario was that the ticket had actually been paid for six months ago  not yesterday  as in the first scenario   This time  less than 30 percent of the respondents said they would attend the event   The immediacy of payment drives attention to the cost of the event  The only difference between the two scenarios is the timing of payment  Why would the timing of payment   how close or far it was from the date of the event itself   motivate these different rates of attendance  Well  it turns out that the timing the immediacy of payment drives attention to the cost of the event  And let s face it  costs are painful  So when people are made aware of the cost  they react by wanting to make the most of what they ve purchased  instead of letting it to go to waste  That  in turn  drives motivation to use the product or service   even sometimes  at the cost of something else  like one s health or level of enjoyment   Another example in the study asked college students to assume they had purchased tickets for two different ski trips  only to realize later that both trips were scheduled for the same weekend  One ticket had cost  50 while the other cost  100  Students were told they knew they d actually have more fun on the  50 trip  Knowing this  which trip would they choose  Because of the salience of the cost  most of them said they would choose the  100 trip   This speaks to the power of the value people place upon the cost of what they ve purchased  To justify the expense  usage of the product or service becomes tantamount to other things that are also important   like the value of one s health  enjoyment  or actual preferences   Using Payment Design to Drive Usage  We see here  then  that the design of the payment schedule can be crucially important in driving the usage of a product or service  Why is this important  Why should companies care about level of usage  Health clubs  for example  might prefer to receive the entire membership payment from customers up front  without being concerned about the extent to which members actually use the facilities  Indeed  it might even be to their benefit if usage falls off during the year  since equipment wear and tear would then be reduced  along with maintenance expenses   But what about when the end of the year approaches and the time for membership renewal rolls around  For those who no longer attend regularly  how likely is it that they ll renew their membership  That big one time renewal fee can loom large for those who are not necessarily making use of their membership  Many customers may not become repeat buyers unless they are actively using the product or service they ve purchased   And this is one reason why companies should care about usage  For health clubs   and most other businesses  as well   it costs a lot more to acquire new customers than to keep existing ones  Customer retention depends a lot on the extent to which products and services are actually being used or consumed   It s also important for businesses that have a two part revenue stream such as movie theaters  sports arenas  and concert halls  Although ticket sales are the primary revenue stream for these industries  there is additional profit to be made from parking fees  refreshments  souvenirs  etc  But this revenue will never be realized if people aren t actually using their tickets and attending the events   From a digital perspective  many websites offer a free trial of their product  The DocuSign site  for example  allows you to download a free trial prior to purchase  This strategy is effective because it enables people to try something risk free in order to determine if they really want to pay for it  In other words  these sites promote usage first  in order to provide prospects a comfort level in purchasing the product  But unless users continue to use the product once they ve completed the purchase  they may be unlikely to renew  And many companies make more money selling upgrades than selling the initial application   And what about the impact of usage on social media  You can t generate recommendations and positive word of mouth from customers who aren t actively using your product or service   Pay as you go Pricing  Many companies give considerable attention to determining the right price for a product or service  but not so much to the timing and schedule of payment  In general  there are three different scenarios that can occur in regard to the timing of paying and consuming   We pre pay  and consume later  We pay at the same time we consume  so that payment and consumption occur almost simultaneously  We consume something first  and then pay later  Many businesses prefer that customers pay up front because they receive payment earlier rather than later  In a previous article  I discussed how pre paying can also help people find more enjoyment during the actual consumption experience  because the pain of payment is distanced from when the product service is actually used  In fact  sometimes consumption can actually end up feeling  free    Similarly  if payment is painful  the timing of when that payment is required is key to minimizing customers  perceived discomfort  It s kind of like how doctors often keep lollipops and other distractions in their office  for when they re giving kids vaccinations  as brilliantly demonstrated in the video below   See that  Barely a peep   In light of our discussion in this article  though  there is a potential downside to prepayment  When payment and consumption are distanced enough so that consumption begins to feel free  people can end up discounting the value of the product or service precisely because it does feel free  In short  free fails to motivate usage  A  pay as you go  paradigm is the one that motivates usage because of the way in which it draws attention to the cost   Bundled vs  Itemized Pricing  Price bundling is another aspect of pricing that can have an impact on usage  One advantage of bundling is that it hides the cost of individual items that are included in the bundle  Examples of price bundling include season tickets for concerts and sporting events  subscriptions to online or print publications  and the membership fee for health clubs and country clubs  Price bundling is also commonly used in retail sales   Businesses assume that hiding the itemized costs through bundling will be beneficial for actually making the sale  But hiding or masking the costs of individual items in a bundle can have a downside  Because the  itemized  costs are made less salient  and costs help people understand what each item is truly worth  bundling can have an adverse effect on usage   Itemized costs help people understand what items are worth  so bundling can have an adverse effect on usage  For example  researchers analyzed attendance data for a Shakespearean summer festival season which included four performances  The data showed that some people had purchased tickets to a single play while others had purchased tickets for anywhere from two to all four plays  The no show rate was less than 1 percent for those who had purchased only one ticket  and rose respectively as the number of tickets purchased increased   That is  as the size of the bundle increased  so too did the no show rate  In fact  for those who had bought all four tickets as a bundle  the no show rate rose 35 fold  compared to those who had purchased only one ticket   Automatic payment  So we see that pricing methods that hide the cost can have a demotivating effect on usage  Many people who have medical insurance through their employer are set up to have their monthly premiums auto deducted from their paycheck  Even though these payments occur monthly  they are essentially hidden  since they occur automatically  requiring no effort on the part of the employee to actively make the payment   While this might be a good thing in some ways  it also has a potential downside  Many HMOs and other insurance providers prefer that members take the initiative to get annual physicals as well as suggested routine tests and procedures  etc  However  studies show that member compliance is low  How could HMOs more effectively motivate healthy behaviors   Using Pricing Design to Drive Demand  Researchers suggest that making the costs of these services more salient  by itemizing the price of individual services and fees within the bundled cost  would raise awareness of money spent on those services  Reminders could be sent to members who are not using or consuming the services during the year  in order to make the out of pocket cost more salient  thereby providing an incentive for maximizing the benefits of the medical plan   Or consider the example of the health club we ve been discussing  It s frustrating when a trip to the gym turns into more of a waiting game than an actual workout  when attendance is at its peak at the beginning of the year  Consider how the design of the billing cycles might be used to offset the strain on facilities driven by new year s resolutions  One idea offered by researchers is that the health club could stagger billing cycles by offering 10 or 14 month contracts  to compensate for the cycle of January renewals   The Power of Design  UX professionals are inherently interested in how and when people use the products and services they purchase  In this article  we ve examined how the power of pricing design impacts and drives usage  This is a very practical example of how design matters   Some people conceptualize design as being an aesthetic   the  frosting on the cake  that makes things pretty  But this kind of thinking is way too narrow  Effective design has the power to motivate behavior  compel usage  and ultimately  drive your business   Studies referenced in this article   Pricing and the Psychology of Consumption

1301,training-dataset/product/1400.txt,product,Why judgment matters more then outcomesGetting the Job Done Why judgment matters more then outcomes  Last week I joined an offsite with hundreds of product managers where Dave Orr  a Google PM  spoke about decision making  Dave is a former professional poker player  yeah  Google PMs are eclectic   In poker  as in life  you can make an excellent decision  yet still lose the hand  Or you can make a dumb move and get lucky  That s the nature of the game  Players can easily fall victim to cognitive biases if they start second guessing their decisions based on whether or not they won the hand  The best poker players evaluate and improve their judgment  independent of the outcome   Dave s talk came to mind this weekend while watching my son Carter s basketball practice  During scrimmages  the coach often said  good shot   even when the ball didn t go through  I also noticed that he occasionally stayed silent when shots hit  So why was an airball from the block celebrated but a beautiful jumper from the arc wasn t  Because the coach cares more about judgment than outcomes  At this young age  he s reinforcing smart shot selections  If you picked a satisfactory moment to shoot  that deserved praise  whether or not the ball went through the rim  Showing shrewd awareness about when to take the shot is more important to middle school kids than the number of points on the board  The shooting ability will come once the right habits are formed  That s essential in a sport where the greatest players in the world miss half their shots   So take a lesson from Carter s coach and from Dave so you had a dreadful result  but did you make the right decision  Or you did well  but was it only because you got lucky  What did you learn that will upgrade your intuition for next time   COMPETING AGAINST LUCK  The Story of Innovation and Customer Choice  By Clayton M  Christensen  et al   288 pp  Harper Business   17 99 on Amazon com By Clayton M  Christensen  et al 288 pp  Harper Business  I ve made no secret of my admiration for Clayton Christensen  The Innovator s Dilemma is the most important business book of the last half century  In that book  Christensen introduced the theory of disruption  explaining why entrenched incumbents can be blind to immature upstarts with  worse  products  We ve seen it play out again and again  from Salesforce com to Airbnb   Christensen is back with a new book  Competing Against Luck  which explores one of his approaches to combating the Innovator s Dilemma  Jobs To Be Done  JTBD   Christensen first introduced the concept using the example of a fast food milkshake way back in 2009  Since then  the idea has taken on a life of its own  and like his earlier theory  increasingly misunderstood   What is a JTBD  From the book   We define a  job  as the progress that a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance  This definition of a job is not simply a new way of categorizing customers or their problems  It s key to understanding why they make the choices they make  The choice of the word  progress  is deliberate  It represents movement toward a goal or aspiration  A job is always a process to make progress  it s rarely a discrete event  A job is not necessarily just a  problem  that arises  though one form the progress can take is the resolution of a specific problem and the struggle it entails   In Christensen s original story  the  job  that customers were  hiring  a milkshake to do was make their morning commutes less boring  Understanding that shaped how the restaurant approached packaging and marketing during the commute hours   I heartily recommend Competing Against Luck  That said  I wish he d written this book five years ago  before JTBD took on a life of its own  Christensen is careful to explain that there might be many jobs for a particular product  that they are circumstance specific  and cannot be generalized as a way of categorizing swaths of customers or simplifying away nuances   He even used the example of a second job for the milkshake  hiring it as a special treat for his children that made him feel good as a parent   However  that s exactly how I ve seen JTBD explained and used  Hopefully Christensen s book will set some people straight   For a good introduction to the book and a Q A with its author  check out  Innovation guru Clayton Christensen s new theory is meant to protect you from disruption  on Quartz   Good Reads   The product people get driven out of decision making

1311,training-dataset/business/127.txt,business,Lessons from a Startup Within a Startup   The Startup   MediumLessons from a Startup Within a Startup  By Kyle Morrow  When I started working at Buffer  there was a phrase I heard often when discussing projects and ideas   Let me reflect on that    It s a sentiment I had rarely heard at the previous tech companies I worked for  and it surprised me   While moving fast and making quick decisions can be a very valuable approach  I have learned from Buffer that it s also great to make the space to pause and reflect   At the 1 year anniversary of Buffer s image creation tool Pablo  it feels like a good time to reflect on the triumphs and challenges of our own  startup within a startup  and to process what we have learned    A quick note before we start  I have only had the pleasure of working on Pablo for a few months  so when I say  we   I mean all the amazing people at Buffer who have been part of the Pablo story    Here s the inside story of building Pablo over the past year  and what it feels like to create a  startup within a startup    January 2015   Engaging images  project begins  The idea for Pablo emerged from two distinct paths   Kevan  on our marketing team  happened to share some friction points he had with creating images for social media   At the same time  our Customer Development team was hearing that users were struggling to create engaging images for the content they were sharing through Buffer  Users recognized that if they included an image with their posts  they would see more engagement  However  this was a challenge to put into practice   There are several great tools that help create images  but after reflecting on some of the pain points we had heard  it felt like we could build a solution internally that also integrated nicely with Buffer   It quickly became clear that there was an opportunity   Here s the original description from the product spec dated Jan  8  2015  At this point  the project was known only as the  engaging images project     Lesson learned  From this time period we learned our first lesson  Solve your own problem   February  Testing  validating and naming  After defining what needed to be validated  the team got to work on a minimum viable product  It took about a month to build and was heavily focused on creating images quickly  There were only a few features and a strong emphasis on quotes   Here s an early prototype   Our emerging tool now needed a name  Here s a bit of the conversation around choosing  Pablo  as the tool s title   And the email from which Pablo was born   We quietly launched our new tool to a small group of users in mid February  with the unofficial tagline of  create engaging social images in 30 seconds   Here s a look at some last bits of internal testing before sharing it   The goal with the first version of Pablo was to validate the hypotheses that came from the initial customer interviews  We believe that Buffer users experience trouble creating engaging images when sharing to Twitter   So it felt like great validation late in the month when we got some promising results from the product market fit survey we ran   We still weren t sure if we were solving the right problems or if we were solving them in the right way  There was a lot of work to do to figure out if we were on the right path   And yet we got a lot of excitement from the amazing community at Product Hunt  who picked up on Pablo before we were even quite ready   Lesson learned  Launch before you are ready   March  Launching and learning  Finally in March we felt great about the first version of our little project and officially launched Pablo   We got some great press and tons of great feedback  including a signal that we might want to explain the name a bit further   With those great thoughts from Joel in mind  here are some of the  mascot  ideas we explored for Pablo   Before finally landing on the image you see on Pablo now   Lesson learned  Remove any barriers in the way of your customer getting the hang of your product   The quiet summer  A lot of new entrepreneurs fall into the trap of thinking that if you build a product  users will naturally discover it and start using it   It s even easier to fall into this trap when you are lucky enough to work on a new product within a company that is already growing quickly and has a thriving community   The Buffer community is extremely supportive and this was very clear during the launch of Pablo  However  it quickly became clear that growth needs to be intentional   Not long after the launch of Pablo  there were some changes that caused us to put less focus on Pablo in comparison to Buffer  We were experimenting with self management and also focusing on building an integration with Pinterest   This led to Pablo being set to the side a bit   and as you can see from the data  if you are not focusing on growth  it will not happen on its own   Lesson learned  Just because you build it  doesn t mean they will come   Fall  Determining the future of Pablo  After launching Buffer for Pinterest and learning some valuable lessons from exploring self management  it felt like it was time to figure out what was next for Pablo   During these conversations  there were some critical questions that came up   Is this a business or a side project   Do we even need the Pablo name or should we just integrate it into Buffer   What is the market opportunity for Pablo   To be honest  we are still wrestling with some of these questions and don t have clear answers yet   However  we knew we wanted to learn quickly  We decided to focus on what we could do immediately to move Pablo forward and continue to provide value to our users   After several customer interviews  these were our action items   Make Pablo a good Pin creator  We had just introduced Pinterest within Buffer  and this felt like a great tie in   We had just introduced Pinterest within Buffer  and this felt like a great tie in  Make it easier to import images and text into Pablo  People were going out of their way to share interesting snippets of text from other sites  and images serve mostly to call attention to their text   People were going out of their way to share interesting snippets of text from other sites  and images serve mostly to call attention to their text  Keep Pablo separate from Buffer for now  The need for quick social media images extends beyond the Buffer community  and we had data showing that lots of non Buffer users were finding value with it   Lesson learned  To keep a project moving forward  focus on what you can do right now   October  Pablo 2 0 Launch  Based on these learnings  we got to work on creating Pablo 2 0  and launched it in October 2015   The goal with this iteration was to make Pablo feel more like an app  as opposed to a super powered page   This led to a cleaner UI and several new features  However  the goal of empowering users to create engaging social images in 30 seconds had not changed   The launch of Pablo 2 0 was a success  and we saw a new spike in usage   However  after the excitement had settled  the usage numbers dropped back down  The interesting thing was that we had new baseline that was a clear step up from before   We tried this again with an even smaller improvement   upgrades to the Pablo extension   and shared it with the Buffer community  There was again an initial spike and then a drop to a new baseline   We were gaining more users from the Buffer community with each iteration  There was a clear cycle  and the goal became to get through those cycles as quickly as possible   Lesson learned  Early growth often feels like stair steps   Early 2016  Fine tuning and product market fit  After launching Pablo 2 0 and creating a product area for Pablo  there was still a critical question that we needed to answer  Does Pablo have product market fit   We have measured product market fit a few times using the survey that Sean Ellis created   most recently just a few weeks ago   Each time the results showed that 67 70  of users would be  very disappointed  if they could not use Pablo anymore   Based on Sean s suggestion that you have product market fit with anything over 40   this is a fantastic result  We must be on the right path  right   As we dove into the data  we found that usage of Pablo was sporadic and our retention was less than ideal  If people would be disappointed about not having Pablo   then why aren t they using it more often   One hypothesis that we have is that we are not addressing enough use cases with Pablo  Pablo does a few things very well and people love it for that  However  we have ambitious goals for Pablo and will need to continue to address more pain points for users in order to drive regular usage and continue to grow   We want to continue to learn from power users of Pablo and figure out how to make it part of their weekly workflow   Lesson learned  Product market fit does not always correlate to retention   The future of Pablo  We have learned a lot over the last year with Pablo and will continue to iterate on the product   and iterate on the team   As a company grows and more people join  jobs start to become more specialized  We now have marketing  customer support  data and several other types of experts that provide incredible advice on each topic   As a startup within a startup  it feels like this would be a huge benefit that other startups don t have  But more resources can also cause you to move slower   When you only have a small team working on the project  each person wears many hats as more of a generalist   You don t reach out to your marketing team to help with the latest blog post or email  you do it yourself   You don t have hours to spend analyzing data and instead look at a few KPIs   You see every bug and flaw with your product because you are the one answering all of your support requests   This might not always scale as a company grows  but it can be critical for the early the days   What this means for Pablo is that we have reduce the team working on it to three people who will operate as generalists  We are also replicating the startup environment by using other members of Buffer as advisors  while the day to day activities are done by the core team   Lesson learned  Early stage startups often need generalists   Over to you  Even as a startup within a growing startup  I ve learned w are not immune to the lessons that many veteran entrepreneurs have been writing about for years   We have made a lot of mistakes and will make many more  Our goal is to learn every day and continue to improve  There are some exciting things coming for Pablo and in a year from now  I hope we can celebrate Pablo s second birthday with several new lessons   I d love the chance to hear about lessons you ve learned while launching a product or growing a business  And if

meander and spend  3 hours on this topic this week   Save some of these links and read them throughout the week  Immerse yourself in this topic and leave the week smarter than you started it   Join here to receive the next Edition of Evergreen Business Weekly   Evergreen is a Bi weekly collection of links to the best learning resources in business  collected by a group of managers  founders  and investors  We contribute resources about one topic  which are synthesized and shared in this Collection  The goal is to learn more efficiently through increased context and focus   Why Story Matters  The most profound way to look at storytelling is to say that it is the defining characteristic of being human  Which is not an overstatement  but more of a biological fact   Story is what makes Homo Sapiens unique  In Sapiens  Yuval Harari talks about the Cognitive Revolution as the change that enabled us to begin to cooperate  learn  and take over the world   The truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions  Rather  it is the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all  As far as we know  only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen  touched  or smelled   This ability to speak about fiction is the most unique feature of Sapiens language      Fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things  but to do so collectively  We can weave common myths such as the biblical creation story or the nationalist myths of modern states  Such myths give Sapiens the unprecedented ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers   Story  at the most basic level  is a fiction designed to unify people  By experiencing something through story  people s understandings begin to overlap and we can better coordinate and work with one another   While Sapiens is not explicitly about story  the explanations of how social constructs like religion and money that unify humanity have their roots in story are fascinating and give great context to learning about Storytelling   Thanks to Aaron Wolfson for suggesting Sapiens as a resource here   How Story Affects Us  The Storytelling Animal  contributed by Nathan Bashaw  is a fantastic book that explores how thoroughly this ability to create fiction has permeated our lives  and what it does to us   Story actually creates more than emotional empathy with a character  there is a physical response from our bodies   Mirror neurons in our brains re create for us the distress we see on the screen  We have empathy for the fictional characters   we know how they re feeling   because we literally experience the same feelings ourselves  When we watch movie stars kiss onscreen  some of the cells firing in our brains are the same ones that fire when we kiss our lovers   Vicarious  is not a strong enough word to describe the effect of these mirror neurons       Stories affect us physically  not just mentally  When the protagonist is in a tight corner  our hearts race  we breathe faster  and we sweat more   This is a level of commitment to story that leaves lasting memories and impressions  and why story is such a powerful tool for teaching and inspiration   good stories aren t just heard  they are felt   The Storytelling Animal goes on to explore how Storytelling defines us by exploring how children instinctively create stories  how culture and morals are passed on through story  and moments in human history that have been changed by a simple story   Story matters because we are defined by our storytelling ability  The way that we can create and share ideas with each other was born  perfected  and perpetuated in story  Storytelling  and story listening  is an evolutionary trait refined over thousands of years to unify and coalesce us as a species   How Story Works  Storytelling can be elegantly simple or bafflingly complex  and everyone seems to have their own secret to  deconstructing  story and explaining what pieces are important and what works  Of course  there are some very core principles that are foundational  which is where we will start   The Most Basic Story Structure  Stories have three parts  beginning  middle  and end  No matter what else happens  it has those three things  But there are very important things that must happen in each of those parts  that forms the arc of the story and makes it a powerful experience for the listener   This TED Talk from British literary agent Julian Friedmann does a beautiful job of explaining it  at about 7 00    The three act structure is a function of how the human brain works  Aristotle described the formula 2 5000 years ago  It worked then  and it works today  The Story Structure is three words  Pity  Fear  Catharsis   You need to make the audience feel pity for a character  You do that by making them go through an undeserved misfortune  What that does is enables the audience to emotionally connect with the character  Once the wroter has established that emotional connection  the writer has some control over the audience   You then put the character into worse and worse situations  and because of the emotional connection  the audience feels fear   When you release the character from the danger  the audience feels the catharsis as its own   Catharsis is actually the result of not any intellectual activity  but of chemicals being released in the bloodstream   These three parts have been called many different things in many different places  hooks  inciting incidents  crisis  climax  etc  but those are semantics  I like Friedmann s description because it is powerful and memorable  It describes the audience s emotions  not the writer s technique  If your story can create pity  fear  and catharsis  your audience will feel it   Friedmann finishes his talk with a beautiful thought which is a crucial aspect of story  to remember that it is always about the audience   Please don t forget that you have to entertain us  You have to enable us to look at ourselves  Because when we re looking at the screen  we re not looking at the actors  we re not looking at the characters  and we re certainly not looking at you  We are looking at ourselves   Story requires the effort of the audience  It requires us to lean in  to project ourselves into the place of that character  to create our emotional responses  and to take that character s experience into our own lives   All Stories are the Same  In the vast universe of stories that have been created by humans  from myths to comic book movies  there are really only a handful of  types of story    Storytelling has a shape  It dominates the way all stories are told and can be traced back not just to the Renaissance  but to the very beginnings of the recorded word  It s a structure that we absorb avidly whether in art house or airport form and it s a shape that may be   though we must be careful   a universal archetype   This short post in The Atlantic called All Stories Are The Same does a good job of showing the similarities of the  shape  of so many stories without oversimplifying into a rigid structure   Knowing that stories all branch out from the same trunk is reassuring to those of us trying to learn about them  because it is an infinitely complex language made up of only a few defined building blocks  And if we can understand those blocks  then we can make sense of this massively complex universe of story that surrounds us   Thanks to Jack Mara of 10thoughts for the suggestion   Story is Driven by Mystery  JJ Abrams  TV Movie writer and director  famous for Star Trek  Lost  the new Star Wars  and more is a master of storytelling  And his secret is mastering mystery   He draws people in by giving them questions  curiosities to chase  theories to prove  Here is an excerpt from his  hilarious  TED talk about Mystery   What are story but Mystery boxes  In TV  the first act is actually called the teaser   it is the big question  so you re drawn into it  and of course there s another question  and on and on   This is a very simple and powerful storytelling technique  to withhold key information to create curiosity and engagement  Beyond the suspense created by the uncertainty of the ultimate outcome  there can be small mysteries throughout the story that pull your audience in   Thanks to Brian Sloss of Opower for contributing this talk   How to Story  Given the immense power of story  of course we now wonder how to put this art to work ourselves  Whether we want to entertain friends  nail a job interview  inspire co workers or just tell a good bedtime story  storytelling has some way to benefit our lives   Secret Structure of Great Stories  I love to include an  if you only know one thing  in these posts whenever possible  While lots of these resources are important and helpful to learning about the context of story and specific applications  this TED talk from Nancy Duarte is a great blend of high level and applicable knowledge   She deconstructs and compares Martin Luther King Jr s  I have A Dream  speech and Steve Jobs iphone launch  and shows us how simple and effective storylines can be   As the most basic  story alternates exploring  what is  and  what could be   This inspires the audience to drive toward the new bliss  and assimilate what was possibility into their worldview as a new belief   6 Basic Rules of Story  The master of The Moth  which is a great event podcast based on story   Margo Leitman as a great short post where she summarizes her advice on storytelling  6 Rules for Great Storytelling   It guides you away from the most common storytelling mistakes  and gives you a quick checklist for having a solid story  A short read  worth keeping on hand   Thanks David Baker for suggesting this post and the book  Long Story Short   Pixar s Storytelling Lessons  If there is one organization in America that understands storytelling  it is Pixar  Their string of cultural hits is in large part due to their devotion to the art of story  and the discipline to rework a movie for polished perfection   Audiences admire a character more for trying than for their successes   This set of slides has Pixar s 22 Rules of Phenomenal Storytelling  which are a good set of guiding principles  Some of them are specific to those writing movies or novels  but some are gems of overall story knowledge   Pull apart stories you like  What you like in them is a part of you  you ve got to recognize it before you can use it   It is interesting to read these and see how much you can feel these principles in Pixar s movies  We appreciate good stories  but we don t often know what makes them good or why they feel so good to us until we read things like this that reveal the mechanics of story   Thanks to Jason Evanish and Ben Kinnard for suggesting this resource   The Deep Dive  Story Grid  This is probably overkill for anyone who is not writing a book or movie  but The Story Grid  contributed by Kevin Espiritu  is the best book for understanding complex story structure and the interplay between internal and external struggles   Written by Editor Shawn Coyne  it details the tool that he uses to evaluate and improve books in an attempt to turn them into bestsellers and timeless works of art   The Story Grid shows  in detail  how tensions are created and released throughout stories  and why some stories work and others fall flat  While clearly written for those in the literary world  it does have applicable lessons for anyone working on a large scale creative project   Applying Storytelling to Business  Storytelling is such a pervasive topic that it has the opportunity to affect nearly every aspect of business  hiring  sales  recruiting  partnerships  etc  Really  it is a method of communication with enormous leverage if we can apply it in the right ways   This section is the practitioner s guide   how to apply story to your business to see tangible results   Deconstructing Elon Musk s Presentations  This short read by Andy Raskin is incredibly popular because it breaks down the elements of a good pitch into the basic blocks of story  It is a very simple post  and gives a clear guide to format your product pitch in similar fashion   Here is the structure   Name the Enemy Answer  Why now   Show the Promised Land Identify Obstacles   Strategies Present Evidence of Solution  You notice a similar structure to the multiple story structures we saw above  This is a very tactical translation of the story principles into business speak  and gives you what is basically a mad libs for creating a killer pitch   As for step one  Name an Enemy  Raskin has a separate post about that called Who is your Darth Vader  If it isn t immediately obvious what your enemy is  check that resource out    I personally find this to be an excellent exercise  Some of the enemies of Evergreen are  Shitty Content Marketing  SEO garbage  Churned out Listicles  page view optimizing republishers  shiny object syndrome  and ignorance   Thanks to Abhishek Bhalla and Preet Anand for suggesting Andy Raskin   All Marketers Tell Stories  Of course  Seth Godin had to make this list  His tiny little book  All Marketers Tell Stories fits perfectly with our set of resources  It builds upon the background we have with how integral stories are to our lives  and explores how to create stories in the marketing context   My favorite point of Godin s is that stories aren t meant to change people   but to find the beliefs that already exist in your audience   The best stories don t teach people anything new  Instead  the best stories agree with what the audience already believes and makes the members of the audience feel smart and secure when reminded how right they were in the first place       Runaway hits like LiveStrong fund raising bracelets take off because they match the worldview of a tiny audience   and then that tiny audience spreads the story   This little book doesn t take more than an hour to read  and it is densely packed with helpful thoughts about how to craft a story to represent a business and find your audience   Thanks Aaron Wolfson for an incredibly thorough Godin recommendation   The Leader s Guide to Storytelling  The Leader s Guide to Storytelling  suggested by Nick Seguin  reads like the field guide to using Storytelling in the business world  It starts high level  and dives deep into the details of storytelling in the workplace in a variety of contexts   This book has notes on writing and delivering these stories  in situations from establishing yourself in the company to brand building and managing internal communications   In Summary  There is a long way to go  We ve covered a lot of ground here  from the intertwined roots of storytelling in humanity to the applications of that knowledge in an office context   While there are some great resources here  I get the sense that there is a lot left to learn and apply from the lessons of Storytelling  This doesn t feel like a well explored concept yet  and I can see a path toward far more thorough understanding and application in many different directions   But maybe that is part of the magic of story   that it can t be dissected  analyzed  and reassembled because of the difficulty in studying how perception occurs and effects are subtle   All I know is that I am grateful to have this  story  lens on the way I look at the world now  It is fascinating to hear stories as something that someone has crafted for us  and to think about what the implications of it will be for every individual who hears it,"[1314 567 288 1152 649 232 987 868 561 1360 95]"

product leader at Uber  and before that at SmugMug  Photobucket and Yahoo   Here  she talks about how cultivating happiness put her on her top flight career trajectory   When I was a teenager  I saw the movie Working Girl with Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver  and it had a profound effect on me  I wanted what they had  I wanted to be a savvy corporate sleuth and make big decisions for big companies   Harrison Ford and the skirt suits were just a bonus  It might sound silly  but it changed my life   Growing up in France  my parents were dentists and they wanted me to be one too  I  however  wanted to be a  businesswoman    and  more specifically  after falling in love with math and science   an engineer  My dad  a crusader for his daughters to never compromise  supported me to follow my heart   which ultimately led to working in the U S   becoming a product manager  and joining Uber early  when it was in just 14 cities   Most people are interested in hearing about this one segment of my career  How I helped shape a big part of one of the most influential companies in the world as it grew to 400  cities in 68 countries  But the mindset that got me there is a longer story  going back the 15 years I ve been in Silicon Valley  When I look back  the single most important factor in my success has been happiness   Make no mistake  the path you re on right now is not straight  Even if it feels like it is  Things will go wrong  Plans will fall apart  The only thing in your control is how you ll respond  Being content  grateful and  yes  satisfied in today s culture seems nearly impossible  But those things are much more likely to get you to the right destination than chasing fame  ego  titles  money  What follows is a list of the most powerful lessons I ve learned from my experience   all of which you can apply right now   MAKE YOUR OWN SAFETY NET   You ll be fine if it doesn t work out    Simple words  Tremendous meaning  What if you just decided that you were going to be fine no matter what  You d probably do a lot of things differently  You d test your boundaries  You d trust yourself more  The trick is that feeling this way is just a choice you make  You decide to believe it or not  Too many people in this industry feel like they re on a tight rope suspended 50 stories up  One wrong move and they ll fall  But that s not the case  The people who believe they ll rebound have a lot more power   I was 24 when I decided to work in the U S  I was terrified  but I hustled to make connections  and now it was time to actually go  Once again  my father was the one to give me the push I needed  booking a ticket for us to visit the Bay Area for 10 days   our very first trip to the U S  for both of us  and assuring me that even if I didn t find a job  I d figure something out  I remember printing my resume out at the Stanford library on my way to the Santa Clara University job fair  literally shaking  I ended up getting an offer on this trip  Had I not gone  I wouldn t have   Being daring is all about trusting yourself to handle the results  A shocking number of people in tech know they re brilliant  know they re capable  but don t trust themselves to know what to do if they get fired  fail spectacularly or just want to switch gears towards a more fulfilling path  Shifting your confidence from one area of your life to another gives you the safety net you need to take more chances   I know this works because I had to do it  During the 2002 Silicon Valley downturn  I got laid off  Panic set in  Here I was  now living in the country illegally  crashing on a friend s couch in San Francisco  and I had to figure out what to do to stay in the U S   There was no time to wallow or doubt myself  I had to get out there and start meeting people  I joined a few other networking organizations and Ryze com  and networked hard  I made it known I needed a job and went on many interviews only to get rejected many times  or rejecting a few offers that just didn t feel right  Finally  at the 11th hour  something clicked   It s hard to anticipate what you ll do in this type of situations until you have to  But if you can rewire your brain to know you will be okay  even if you don t get the role  don t get the promotion  don t raise that round  you ll try harder at all of it  and your chances of success will be that much greater  Whenever you find yourself thinking   Oh I can t go after that     or  That s a crazy risk     immediately append the sentence   You ll be fine if it doesn t work out    THINK ABOUT THE WORD  ELEGANCE   You don t hear it a lot these days  It sounds outdated  But that s what makes it special  In tech  people don t think about acting elegantly  To be elegant is to be deliberate  respond gracefully  take things lightly   to move through the world with positive purpose  It s having a soft touch and tough resilience at the same time  And  in my experience  it s an incredible secret weapon   If you were to weather a transition or a tough time elegantly  what would that look like   You d be honest and allow yourself to mourn the lost opportunity  an unexpected hiccup  whatever it is  You d let yourself feel it with the self assurance that the pain is impermanent because life changes fast  Looking strong counts for nothing if you re miserable inside   You d look for hidden opportunities to hasten your recovery  Let s say you got laid off  Now you have time to exercise during the day   You d get comfortable with the uncomfortable  Sometimes you d even seek out the uncomfortable because that s how you grow and get better   You wouldn t take things personally  Life happens  You get caught in the middle of a perfect storm  It sucks but it s not about you  and thinking it is will only make things worse   You d trade expectations for appreciation  Instead of clinging to what you don t have or what you didn t get  you think about what you do have and the power you do have to make a change   The first conversation I had with Uber s recruiter was remarkable  But it ended with her telling me they already had a head of product  Before the call  I had been so attached to that title and only that title  I could have let my disappointment turn into indignance  and closed myself off to the company  Instead  I listened to the excitement in my voice  and the energy in my body when I hung up the phone  I was the best version of myself when I was talking about my goals  Uber and what I could contribute there  I decided to stay open to other possibilities there   Soon after  I started interviewing to head up product for a fashion company in New York  It seemed like the right thing to do  and I diligently built a case for why it was the right move  But I was stretching  and I knew it   Whenever you find yourself working to gather evidence that a decision is the right one  take pause  Rationalizing means you re not in tune with your gut instinct   The right things tend to flow naturally  That s why the right job often feels inevitable  Sometimes you ll want to do something that you absolutely can t rationalize because it just feels right  Think back to the times you ve felt this  rightness  before and pattern match  What happened in those past experiences  Were you right or wrong  Did you learn something valuable  The answer is probably yes   Approaching things elegantly means you don t take things too seriously  No opportunity is the be all end all  The stakes are never make or break  All of that is just noise obscuring your intrinsic sense of what makes you happy   LET GO OF STATUS  Titles are your enemy  If I had stuck to my guns on only accepting head of product roles  I would have missed out on the rocket launch of a lifetime   Two months after my first call with Uber  they were ready to hire another product leader  So I came in to meet with their head of product  She was five years younger and had less experience  This could have been brutal  but I was determined to check my ego at the door  and I m so glad I did  We were able to brainstorm and build off each other s ideas about ride sharing  and the emotions customers attach to the company  We liked how each other s brains worked  By the end of the hour  I knew I wanted to work with her   The chemistry you feel with other people is the most underrated factor in whether you should take a job  Today  I m convinced that the primary reason to take a role is to work with a great manager and a great team  Together  they determine nearly all of your happiness on the job  This means letting go of your assumptions about title and money  Making this tradeoff will pay off in surprising ways   For years  my product manager friends and I would obsess about salary  our next promotion  the next company we d join to get a bump up  Then we all made head of product somewhere and realized it wasn t anything so special   certainly not worth all the time and anguish  What was special was looking around at our colleagues and realizing we loved working with them  that we were having fun  that we were building cool things that were getting used  We realized we didn t have to only go after what was sexy  We could make what we were doing sexy  and that was a much more interesting challenge   Not getting hung up on status has cut the other way for me too  Eventually  it was time for me to interview with Travis  Uber s co founder and CEO  and a lot of people would be nervous in that scenario  I was determined to walk in there and talk to him like any other human being  and within 10 minutes  we were geeking out together about our prior technical experiences  At the end of the conversation  he said he had one more question for me  and I joked back   Well  we have two minutes left   He chuckled  and I knew I d be going into a work environment where everyone s ideas are weighed equally   Letting go of status is not about settling for less  It s simply not letting it drive your decision making  And it s not getting intimidated by others  status  If it doesn t matter in one situation  it shouldn t matter no matter where you rank on the company s org chart  That attitude has served me well and brought me closer to people   ALWAYS ASK FOR WHAT YOU DESERVE  Sometimes you have to compromise  but that doesn t mean you should stop asking for exactly what you want  This is important for everyone  though it tends to be a little harder for women   First  know what you want  Second  understand  honestly  the value you bring to your company  Your goal is to balance these things to move the needle on your compensation  responsibilities  etc   If you ask for too little  you will feel shortchanged  If you ask for too much  you ll feel like an impostor  Never pin your happiness on promises of promotions  raises or bonuses unless you re okay with being disappointed  Businesses grow and shrink  Managers leave  The next thing you know  the guy who gave you your offer has moved on and anything he promised is void   The best course of action is to ask for what you know you deserve upfront  Don t hide it  But if you don t get it   which sometimes  perhaps often times  you won t   be patient  Don t drop it or reassess your value or motivation for the job on the basis of that decision  Just hold steady  Be happy with the knowledge that you ll get what you want if you do good work and keep it on people s radar   A big part of this is understanding your motivation  Are you going after things based on your ego or your desire to be happy   In other words  are you trying to be right or trying to be happy   The problem with the ego  It s never happy  Even if I would have gotten the Head of Product position right out of the gate  I probably would have ended up wanting more   Be careful to not rely on external sources of reinforcement  This often motivates poor decision making  You re the one in the job day in day out  and your happiness matters most to you   no one else  Sure  TechCrunch can write a nice article about a company  and tomorrow there s massive backlash  If the only reason you joined that company was for the prestige or popularity  you re screwed   I used to think that other people were keeping score for me  I thought they were watching and I had to keep moving up and doing more to keep up  But no one is watching that closely  Your job trajectory will deeply affect the person you become  Every opportunity is the chance to build connection with others  learn about yourself  and build your life one brick at a time  If you join a team that brings out the best in you  you grow  If it brings out the worst in you  you re setting yourself back   Always go after what you deserve  If you find yourself in a bad situation  don t whine about it  Get the data you need to make a better decision next time  You can always learn something from other people   from good and not so good relationships alike   YOUR NETWORK IS YOUR NET WORTH  This is an incredible clich  for a reason  Most of your career and mobility will be determined by your relationships  If you accept this empirically  you ll invest a lot more in your connections   Even if you re an introvert  there are things you can do to forge strong bonds  It all comes down to emotional intelligence  which  in my opinion  has the following components   Empathy   This has been especially critical at Uber with such a diverse team spread out around the world  You have to go the extra step to put yourself in someone s shoes  think through their personal motivations  wants and needs  and respond to them on that basis   Long term view  The best relationships are long term ones where you can both give back to each other many times  Don t sacrifice relationships for short term gains  It s never worth it  Assume you re going to run into everyone again and again  You d probably be kinder  more understanding  more likely to invest in getting to know them   Know the stakes  The people who are closest to you end up heavily influencing your work  the way you behave  your family life  your potential  Given all this  would you associate with different people  Try to form more positive bonds with your colleagues   Find out what people love  It might not even be work related  but everyone adores something  Their dog  skiing  solving hard problems  a good Scotch  Find out this answer for as many people as you can and always be on the lookout to send them an article  give them a gift  pass onto them an opportunity that touches this part of their heart  This will make you memorable and indispensable   Be selfless  Generously forge connections between others  Unblock others so they can have the glory  They won t forget it  This will give your team a chance to shine and the motivation they need to take it to the next level  At the end of the day  you can work to make yourself more successful or you can work to make your team  including you  and the product more successful  It seems like a no brainer   Don t be intimidated  Networking events can be scary and seem contrived  especially if you re an introvert  Don t give into this fear  Just go and talk about anything   a good restaurant you went to lately  your upcoming vacation  a TV show  Good networking is all about finding commonalities and then leaning into them  If you don t connect with one person  shake it off and move on  It costs you nothing in the grand scheme of things   Whenever I meet someone at an event or through work  I always follow up with an email about how nice it was to meet them and a thoughtful mention of something we discussed  I also connect with them on social media and make a point of commenting on their shares   but only because I genuinely care  It s one of the easiest ways to deepen your connection with someone  Today  I have close friends I ve only met once or twice in real life because we made a meaningful connection when we first met  and every subsequent encounter nurtured that bond  Who has time for superficial interaction anyway  And where is the fun in that   There have been times when these people helped me a ton in my career and times when I was the one who helped them  I know most of my professional connections on a personal level  because when you spend that much time together  why not   BUILD TRUST  BUST JUDGMENT  Lots of people are out there meeting people  adding them on LinkedIn  and moving on  Very few nurture these bonds on a regular basis  Core to this is inspiring people to trust and share with you  Whenever I start working with a team member  I tell them upfront that they can share anything they feel comfortable sharing and it will go no further  And because I have their success at heart  I ll be on their side  no judgment   A while ago  one of my engineers and I went on a walk   our weekly one on one ritual  Halfway through our loop around SOMA  he apologized for being repeatedly late to our daily stand up meeting  I asked him why he thought this had become a chronic problem  and he explained that he was going to bed late every night to handle his workload  Together  we were able to find a more efficient way for him to get this work done  If he hadn t felt comfortable sharing this in the first place  he would have burnt out and probably left   If people suspect that confiding in you will actually impact your opinion  or their performance review  or word of mouth about them within the company  you re not doing a good job as a leader  People do their best work when they feel they have a safe space where they can be human  they can be vulnerable and allow for space to go beyond their comfort zone and  as a result  grow  If they don t have this  they complain outside of work  their dissatisfaction amplifies  and it s a negative feedback loop   When you become a confidante in the office  and prove that you won t share information and there won t be any negative ramifications to sharing  people will want to help you too  They ll want to listen to you  They ll advocate for you  Because having that safety is invaluable   Gossip is the ultimate enemy of efficiency  It s toxic  sucks value out of relationships  and only creates problems  And not just small scale problems   big  pernicious  long lasting problems like fear  insecurity  grudges  and burnt bridges  If you re a leader  you need to never gossip  If you see gossip happening  you have to nip it in the bud  or force whoever it is to be more transparent and share their complaints openly   It only takes one time to break someone s trust permanently  You say one thing and it s out there in the air  floating away  no way to recover it  So just don t  Everyone you work with needs to know they have nothing to lose by telling you what s important to them   MAKE THE STRUGGLE POSITIVE  Working at a startup is going to be a hard knock down fight every day  But the best work isn t going to be born out of suffering  You have to find  vocalize  and rally positivity that stems from doing something difficult together  At Uber  I led a team of product managers and engineers  and this was my objective  It was me and my team against the world  But how can you do this   Identify the people on your team who are fighters and survivors  They ve been through projects that have failed  They ve had work thrown out  They ve made it through massive scaling efforts and came out productive on the other side  Make them your lieutenants and role models  They ll help foster a culture of hustle and grit and inspire the rest of the team to keep pushing through   Be generous with small words of encouragement   Don t reserve praise for the big wins  Try to give everyone a pat on the back as often as you possibly can  It makes a massive difference  And it often takes over communicating for someone to even hear you once   If you need to tell someone they re sucking  just do it  Don t sentence them to death by a thousand cuts  Don t talk around it  Just rip that band aid off so you can immediately shift gears into what they can realistically do to improve  and quite frankly  I expect and seek the same in return  If you hedge and don t tell them the truth upfront  you re going to sap their energy  If you re direct and honest  you have a much better shot of giving them the momentum to work harder   Call out people s strengths early  often and in public  People will lean into the most rewarding reinforcement they get  This is often more effective than giving negative feedback   and other people on the team will seek mentorship from them in those areas   Find your team s battle cry  At Uber  there was this value of flawless execution and ruthless pragmatism   the idea that everything had to be done right because we needed to move fast and had limited chances to nail it  This ended up bringing out the best in everyone given who the culture attracted  It could be different for your team  but the ideal battle cry acknowledges the struggle and the badass mentality it takes to thrive in it   Pay your mentorship forward  Don t expect nor ask people to do anything in return for you  Tell them the best way to thank you is to mentor someone else  Many people took a chance on me  so I ve taken a chance on others  Just the other day  I got an email from a woman who interned with my group saying I gave her her first product role when no one else would  That s impactful for the company in the long run  You re much more likely to build a strong team if you incentivize people to give their knowledge away   YOUR NEXT PHASE STARTS NOW  Everything you re doing today will influence how capable and resilient and happy you are two jobs from now  How you react to every success and failure will build your tool set to handle future challenges and problems  There s one truth you can accept to set yourself up for success  life and work are cyclical  There s no stopping it or working against it   You ve got to truly enjoy the highs when you experience them  and make sure you capture their essence   for me  that means having a deep sense of gratitude in and for those moments  and taking pictures every chance I get  Likewise  you ve got to remember that the lows won t last for long  and that a new high will quickly follow  If you keep that in mind  and surround yourself with people you love and trust  you ll be able to weather the worst of times   Being gritty is a lot like working out  When you start  it s all pain and struggle  Then you have a breakthrough and get into the zone  You start really enjoying it  so you up the ante   and you inevitably crash  In writing  also  you might get into a euphoric groove where everything is just flowing  then abruptly  you hit a wall  In both cases  in order to be truly great  you have to have the wherewithal and skills to push through   In tech  everyone talks about how it s going to be hard  It s going to require grit and tears and late nights and panic attacks  and all the rest  It s glorified  But then when it actually happens  people are still surprised  They didn t think it would be THAT hard   The best tactic for surviving it  Know that there will be times when you learn more  times when you give more  times when you need to take on more  Don t beat yourself up about learning and taking  Know it s not permanent and that you ll give back when you can  The ultimate job is the one where you learn as much as you contribute  You re challenged every day and able to teach others too  You can strive for this balance  as long as you know it s rare   If you stay on this road  you ll build the right set of skills for that next job  and the job after that  Just keep building your empire   and don t apologize   Photography by Bonnie Rae Mills,"[1316 667 154 561 51 1145 456 609 1390 863 799]"
1319,training-dataset/business/440.txt,business,Marc Andreessen at Startup School  Video    The MacroMarc Andreessen  Andreessen Horowitz cofounder and general partner  at Startup School 2016   In his conversation with YC Partner and COO Qasar Younis  Marc outlined two tests investors run on entrepreneurs before working with them   1  Can they get a warm intro   Marc   The way that most of the top end venture capital firms work is basically they ll take you seriously if you come in introduced by somebody they ve worked with before and they won t take you seriously if you don t  There s an argument that plays out in the Valley which is that that s sort of unfair and unreasonable and what about all these founders all over the world and why can t they have access the way the people who are already connected can   The argument in favor of the warm referral is that it s the first test and it s the first test of your ability to basically network your way to the investor  The way the investor thinks about it is if you can t figure out a way to network your way to a VC firm  which is  of course  in the business of meeting founders  then you re unlikely to be able to network your way into hiring a great team or network your way into selling your product to customers   I think that the role of the warm referral is misinterpreted  It s a test you just want to pass  You don t want to take any chances on that  The good news is if you re connected to YC  if you re connected into the Valley angel seed ecosystem  that s a very easy test to pass  If you re not connected into YC then the thing to do is to get to the Valley or get into the network   2  Can they successfully present to Andreessen Horowitz s full partnership   Marc   Usually the process is a first meeting with one of the junior people which might then lead to a second meeting with a broader group of those folks  maybe with one or two general partners   Then the big event is when you progress through one or two or three meetings and you get invited to present to the full partnership  Usually at most firms that s on a Monday  And that s a formal thing  including all the general partners at the firm  Sometimes we ll have 40 people in the room for that   And this gets into another debate  which is  okay you guys go on and on about creativity and all this stuff  why do you want the founder to stand up there like an idiot for 50 minutes reading off powerpoint slides  Why don t we just have a conversation  Why don t we do things casual  Why don t you do more research up front   Again  I think that s misinterpreted  I think the formal presentation is another test  which is as a founder if you re good enough at your job as a CEO to get up and present to an institutional investor for 60 minutes and sell them on your thing  We re easy  VC firms exist to give out money  We love when somebody walks in and has a compelling pitch and we can give them a check  That s a successful day for us   In contrast  every other pitch you re ever going to make will be to somebody who s going to be much worse than us  right  Customers are going to be like  No  I m not gonna give you any money  as their default position  You re going to try to recruit engineers and they ve got 20 other job offers  Why is your pitch going to be so much better than the other 20 startups   Later in the conversation Qasar asked Marc who he looks up to   Marc   I m a big fan of history  There s sort of a classic clich  in the Valley which is we don t respect history very much  And for a lot of people who visit the Valley for the first time that s their impression because they want to drive around Silicon Valley and it s like  good luck with that   There s a freeway  There s a strip mall  There s an office park  There s a security guard that won t let you in the office park  There s no physical history here  really   And we re all about the future  We re building the future  So I think there s a natural tendency to assume the past isn t very relevant  And I actually criticize a little bit the Elon  Musk  school of thought  which is very strong in the Valley  which is about thinking from first principles  It has its huge strengths for sure but it does kind of dismiss the idea that people who came before us had anything to teach us   My general view is the people who came before us had a harder time doing what they did than we do  The world was in a more immature state  Startups started before 50 years ago didn t have venture capital  Startups before 20 years ago didn t have the internet  Things were harder in the past   So the people who were successful in the past I think were often better than we are because they had to be  I ll recommend a few books   The Maverick and His Machine by Kevin Maney  If you think that Steve Jobs was rough on people  he had nothing on Thomas Watson Sr  The book has transcripts of executive staff meetings at IBM in the 1930s and 1940s and let s just say he was an absolute terror  And built an extraordinary company  So he s a role model though not the terror part   Bill   Dave by Michael S  Malone  It talks about how Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard built HP over the course of 30 or 40 years   Then I like going back further  I like what was called the Second Industrial Revolution where you got electricity and cars   The Wizard of Menlo Park by Randall E  Stross  I Invented the Modern Age by Richard Snow  If you go back and read the history of cars a hundred years ago  Detroit was a lot more like Silicon Valley today than I think people understand  In fact with Henry Ford  Ford Motor Company was not his first company  There are all these interesting backstories   And you can go back even further  This is not to compare us to this but just as inspiration and role models  Florence at the time of the Medici and Leonardo DaVinci   Leonardo s Lost Robots by Mark Rosheim  It turns out DaVinci  while he was doing everything else that he did in life  he was also designing robots  And in his sketchbooks there are fully fledged designs for like everything mechanical  Things like all the Boston Dynamics projects  He was trying to invent all that stuff 500 years ago and didn t quite have the technology to pull it off  Couldn t quite go to TI and get the microcontroller  So he had some issues but  you know  he s an inspiration   The Lunar Men by Jenny Uglow  It s about the Lunar Society  which was in England about 250 years ago  James Watt who invented the steam engine and all these other guys who were doing this kind of thing back then all worked together  They had sort of a YC thing going back then   Subscribe to The Macro newsletter to receive Startup School talks as we release them,"[1319 154 1390 561 1316 877 51

1320,training-dataset/business/475.txt,business,The Formula That Leads to Wild Success  Part 3  Elon MuskThe Formula That Leads to Wild Success  Part 3  Elon Musk  People who back their ideas and opportunities with hard work  a positive attitude and faith are very successful  They re the individuals we look up to and admire in society  They follow the unofficial winning formula of humanity  which they put into practice each day   They have maximized their talent by believing in themselves  having the audacity to put themselves in the spotlight and outworking everyone while never  ever giving up  We choose people like these as role models to look up to and to inspire us  They serve as a baseline  a standard of greatness  for us to study and measure ourselves against   Today is the third installment of my series on individuals  who in their own inimitable way  followed this formula to overwhelming greatness  Over the course of the next several weeks  I will showcase 10 individuals who have shattered the limits of expectation to re define greatness  Up next  the remarkable success story of inventor  Elon Musk   You can read Part 1 on Michael Jordan here and Part 2 on Oprah Winfrey here  Enjoy   The Spirit That Drives Greatness  Innovation is the spirit  the engine  that drives true greatness and inspires the dreams of inventors all over the world  Elon Musk  of Space X and Tesla Motors fame  is the foremost innovator in modern times  Perhaps you ve sent or received money via the online money transfer company that he co founded  PayPal  You may not yet drive a Tesla but maybe you ve benefited from solar energy that his company  SolarCity has produced   Musk s creations have possibly impacted you  If they haven t already  they likely someday will  The 45 year old inventor and businessman remains at the forefront of digital and technological advancement in multiple businesses  The range of his ventures is staggering and it seems there isn t a challenge he isn t willing to tackle   Musk is a visionary whose passions extend to space exploration  pediatric research  an increase in science education and the advocacy for renewable energy  He s a fervent believer in the human spirit and the preservation of the human race   For goodness sake  the man is on a quest to set up a human colony on Mars  How s that for far out   Elon Musk s Foresight  Great inventors are blessed with foresight  the unique ability to envision a future that never existed  and perhaps only they can see  Elon Musk s imagination and belief in a braver  bolder future are part of what make him a great inventor  The secret to his brilliance  His capacity to come up with ideas some scoff at  others reject and most wish they dared to dream    What makes innovative thinking happen   I think it s really a mindset  You have to decide     Elon Musk  Musk was bullied unmercifully as a child and used it as motivation to continue forging forward  He believed in his ideas  tested them in the marketplace and found the fortitude to continue innovating   In order to achieve what seems to be impossible  you need to imagine yourself doing things that frankly  may seem crazy  Visualization is the art form perfected by all great inventors and those of us who thirst for something bigger than who we are  People with great imaginations refuse to accept the status quo   When you first see your future  the realization of your goals  it is easier to attain them  They become more realistic and this gives way to faith  the indestructible belief in yourself  your ideas and what you can be   Ideas and Thoughts Rule the World   Constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself    Up next for Musk is the audacious idea of the  Hyperloop   a high speed transportation system that will send pressurized capsules through air compressed tubes  The Hyperloop will permit for high speed travel between San Francisco and Los Angeles  taking only 30 minutes to travel nearly 400 miles  Does this sound like The Jetsons or some far out zany scientist you might find on the Sci Fi channel at 2 45 in the morning  Maybe   But like the world renowned inventor who bears the name of Musk s car company  Musk isn t too concerned with the thoughts of others  Just like people laughed at the seminal ideas of Nikola Tesla  ridiculing him for introducing alternating electric current  wireless radio technology and countless other ideas  Musk has his skeptics  But he is looking ahead to a future beyond many of our wildest dreams   That is a noble cause  One worth working toward   Why Elon Musk is Successful   When something is important enough  you do it even if the odds are not in your favor    Elon Musk is a perfectionist who believes in maximizing his God given talent and making the most use of his time  You don t need to be a workaholic like Musk but  you we can all appreciate why he works as hard as he does  He wants to leave a lasting impact on the world   Starting this series with Michael Jordan  I discussed the legendary work ethic of the basketball great  Like Jordan  Musk is a believer in maximum effort to outwork the competition  Musk focuses on working smart  as well  concentrating his energies in endeavors that he is confident will provide value to others   The beauty of Musk s benevolence is his desire to improve the human condition  his inventions and entrepreneurial ventures are first aimed at adding value to the public good  You ll have to search far and wide to find a better example of an individual who pursues his life s dreams and goals to the fullest   There are a wealth of wonderful resources right here on Medium that are designed to lift your entrepreneurial spirit and inspire you to do great things  Hopefully this article will humbly serve as one of the few  No matter what you choose  find inspiration in the remarkable journey of Elon Musk  Keep coming up with ideas  Keep working hard  Never stop believing in yourself   Please stay tuned for Part 4 in my series next Wednesday  I thank you for your support so far in this series  I m grateful for your readership and incredibly kind comments  If

Facebook  I ve done over 100 product management interviews  shadowed PM hiring committees  and created a class called  The Path to PM  Learning if Product Management is Right for You  through which I ve shared these thoughts with thousands of Googlers  I ve mentored a number of folks who have then successfully transitioned into the PM role   My hope with this article is to give prospective candidates their best shot at showing off their thinking and creativity during a PM interview  Please note that all of the below are my personal opinion and in no way shape or form should be considered official Google guidance   Other Googlers will likely disagree with all of the points in here    Practicing for a PM interview can be a lot of fun and will help develop skills you ll actually need to use regularly on the job  Most great PMs are made  not born  so the good news is that you can develop many key PM skills if you re coming up short in an area  Another piece of good news is that there isn t a singular archetype of successful PM  they come in many different flavors and forms  the Designer PM  The Data PM  The Hacker PM  etc   Maybe I ll save a description of these archetypes for a later post    Some of what I m looking for is attitude   a PM not only needs to get along with other PMs  they are the cross functional glue across Finance  Legal  Marketing  executives  and most critically  Engineering  To have the role work  you probably need someone who is a good mix of friendly  curious  opinionated  engaged  humble  and excited   The best way to practice for a PM interview is to have a friend  ideally who is themselves a PM  ask you questions of a rough form  How would you design an X  kind of product  for Y  demographic of user    Being able to quickly articulate who you re building it for  why they will care  what the product does functionally and visually  and how you ll bring it to market  Consider flipping things around and yourself interviewing someone you know is a great PM to observe how they answer questions   For the actual interview itself  here are my recommendations   Get comfy  Don t worry about how you re dressed  Dress however you feel most comfortable  If you re in a three piece suit and uncomfortable about it you probably shot yourself in the foot  If you re at home in T shirt and jeans  wear that  And itt s simple  but if you re thirsty  make sure to grab a bottle of water  If you need to pee  ask to go to the bathroom  You won t get dinged   Focus on the user  As a PM  your primary job is to identify a potential user in a clear demographic  empathize with the problem they have today  visualize an improvement to their condition  and spell out the solution in sufficient technical detail to be realizable  The whole experience will need to account for how the user finds out about the solution  what makes it compelling  getting them as quickly as possible to an  AHA   moment  and the dynamics that would compel them to pull other people in their network into the experience   Visualize  Once you have an idea for the user story  help me see what you ve built in your mind  Use a whiteboard  your hands  whatever and walk me through what the user sees  what they need to do in detail  If it s a mobile app  sketch out the main screens and what someone will see  Make sure that the most important information is most clearly displayed to a user  hide complexity  Infer as much as possible to reduce user load  PMs do not have to be gurus with visual design  but they do need a sense of UX and information theory  Can t hurt to have read Tufte  either   Build a business  With a solid user story in hand  you should have an understanding of how the economics of your product are going to work  What is it going to cost you to acquire users  What is your likely lifetime customer value  What will it cost you to support your user  While it is true that  No business plan survives first contact with a customer   you need to know whether your idea could possibly be economically sound  A simple  LTV   CAC   S   lifetime value is greater than customer acquisition costs plus support  is a good way to begin the discussion  Finer details like applying an appropriate discount rate to reflect the time value of money can be worked out by your fine peers in Accounting   Be open to  play   While you should clearly articulate where your firm knowledge ends and your wild speculation begins  you should also feel comfortable in speculative territory  calling out your assumptions  however feeble they may be  Bullshitting is confidently saying something you re not sure if is true  Don t do that  Clamming up is refusing to discuss things you don t know with certainty  Don t do that either     If your interviewer hands you new data mid question that may challenge your assumptions  nimbly incorporate and revise as needed   or  as appropriate  put those data in context and charge ahead   Give a crude answer quickly  Don t rathole on fine details  instead  quickly get to a provisional approximately correct answer and then iterate to refine as needed or if in working it out it becomes clear you need to abandon and restart  do that  This is a  breadth first  exploration  go deep where prompted  Your interviewer may be trying to get to 3 5 completely different questions in a 45 minute slot that generally includes a 5 minute warmup at the beginning and a 5 minute  turnaround time  at the end  So it s really actually just a 35 minute interview  With five questions to ask  that could be 7 minutes per question   Reason from first principles  During the technical part of the interview in particular  it is always even more impressive to me if someone is unfamiliar with a specific piece of technology but can use their general technical knowledge to correctly infer how it might work  So if someone knows how public key cryptography works but isn t familiar with the specifics of TLS certificates  they could infer how they might practically work  that is a slam dunk for me   Don t just answer with process  Don t spend all your time describing a process to get to an answer   describe an actual answer  It is understood that an interview is a limited scenario  If someone asks you to design a television for the elderly  don t say   well  I d need to go and spend time with the elderly to begin to know how to answer that   You can call out that this kind of surface area contact in product development is ideal   even necessary   but it s obviously something we can t incorporate into the interview itself  So charge ahead   Check in  Don t just monologue and hold forth for half an hour  if you find you ve been talking with little to no response from your interviewer  pause to do a time check and ensure that you re spending your time answering what they re looking for or if they can guide you to spend more time digging in on things they re interested in  I ve had candidates hold forth on me without pause and it can be awkward for both parties if the interviewer needs to jump in and interrupt you to get you to move on  That said  don t just repeat back the question to buy yourself time while clarifications are fine  stalling is annoying   Vocalize  It s better to talk aloud through your thinking and backtrack  even calling out your idea of a minute ago as dumb  than to wait until you ve got the perfect thing to say  Expose your thinking   Be pragmatic  Fancy technology should take a backseat to pragmatism   be willing to propose solutions that start off  hand cranked  and then build technology to support them later  You can start a huge number of businesses products with an Excel spreadsheet  a human with a cell phone and a car  the ability to process a payment  and a mailing list  A great product answer is something that could potentially be tested in a week   Use tools  ANY tools you bring with you are fair game and you should make use of them if they will help you structure your thought process and argument  If there are post it notes  feel free to use them  If you brought a notebook  feel free to organize your thoughts there  If there s a whiteboard in the room  put it to work   I ll note that every interview I ve ever done has had a whiteboard on the wall   Be bold  My favorite interviews are ones where candidates come up with something really specific and zany  to the point of being controversial or shocking  Naturally  a dramatic proposition needs to be coupled with rationale that can be talked through  but this is one of the biggest areas where I see highly polished and experienced professionals bomb a PM interview  They give reasonable answers to questions but lack depth or novel insight  You should have an opinion about what s wrong with the world around you and how you can help fix it  You should be able to talk about where the industry is going and what its blind spots are  A fantastic candidate will set the interviewer s mind reeling with an answer they ve never heard before  So in short  if you have a really out there concept  don t bite your tongue and stick to the tried and true  We want to see your crazy side   At the end of the interview  if you feel like you had a fun and engaging brainstorm with the interviewer and are full of energy to go build something  it probably went well   The overall process is usually a recruiter phone screen followed by a PM phone screen  followed by an onsite panel of 3 5 back to back 45 minute interviews  where each interviewer may have a different  hat  on to assess one aspect or another of PM excellence  After your onsite interviews  the interviewer feedback is collected and sent to a hiring committee  not including anyone you ve met in the process to date  and a hire no hire decision is made   What not a lot of people realize is that it s actually much better for your odds if you have two fantastic interviews and one that was only so so instead of having three good but not amazing interviews  This is why it pays to be bold   Finally  a lot of the process really is the luck of the draw  A place like Google gets far more excellent applicants than there are available roles to fill  which means that the process knowingly discards a lot of really fantastic folks  Much of it will come down to the people selected to interview you and the personal chemistry you happen to strike with them  Don t beat yourself up if things don t work out  I failed my first several Google interviews decades ago   I wish you the best in your exploration  Let me know how it goes and if these tips were useful to you and how I can improve them    David,"[1327 925 154 561 1248 1316 295 152 684 781 1145]"
1330,training-dataset/business/1357.txt,business,The Three Hour Brand Sprint   GV LibraryStart by drawing three concentric circles on a whiteboard  Label the outside circle  what   the middle circle  how   and the inside circle  why   like this   Plus  knowing why you re in business can be very motivating for you and your team  In other words  it s worth the 30 minutes   On the other hand  you might argue  there are plenty of successful companies whose primary motivation seems to just be  making money  And  yeah  that s a reasonable argument  But if you re reading this post  you probably want a brand that stands out from the competition  and stands for more than just financial success  And I think Sinek s right  why brands are stronger   Sinek s premise is basically this  You need to know why you re in business   and talk about it  When a company has a strong motivation and that motivation shines through  customers buy the product  It s easy to find supporting examples  Sinek points to Apple  but companies like Nike  Patagonia  Airbnb  and LEGO obviously fit the bill   What  How  Why is an exercise based completely on Simon Sinek s  Golden Circle    Sidenote  Sinek s TED talk is the third most popular of all time with 30 million views  despite grainy video and the fact he uses a flimsy flipchart instead of fancy pants slides  It wasn t even at the main TED   it was at a small TEDx event  But the framework and the talk are so great it doesn t matter    Next  collect answers to these questions   What does your company do   A phrase or sentence describing your primary business for the next five years  Examples   Make toothpaste    fix cars   etc   How do you do it   What s your secret sauce  What technology or approach sets you apart from the competition  Examples   Made with all natural ingredients    best in class friendly service   etc   Why   You can think of the why as the reason you get out of bed in the morning and go to work  The why should reflect the core reason your company exists  and it won t change much over time  You may pivot the business  launch new products  and enter new markets  but your why remains the same  Examples   Promote healthy living    help people get where they need to go   etc   Once again  you ll Note and Vote   1  Each person quietly writes down his or her ideas for what  how  and why   2  Going around the room  each person reads their answers aloud and the facilitator writes them on the whiteboard   3  No argument or discussion yet   4  Each person looks at the list and quietly writes down their favorite answers   5  Going around the room  each person reads their votes aloud and the facilitator marks the votes on the whiteboard   6  Discuss what and how for about five minutes each  but don t argue the semantics   it s not that important   7  At the end of each five minute segment  the Decider chooses her favorite answer   8  Discuss why for about ten minutes  This can be difficult  so agree that today s version will be a placeholder   you can come back to it later   9  After ten minutes  the Decider makes the call   10  Take a photo of the whiteboard and add it to your slide deck   To better understand the power of why  let s talk about Apple and Nike   As I mentioned above  Simon Sinek uses Apple as an example of a company who understands and communicates their why extremely well  Normally  I avoid using Apple or Steve Jobs as an example for anything  because  a  it s really overdone and  b  there are so many hard to replicate reasons for their success  Saying  do what Apple did   isn t very helpful advice  But  when Laura showed me this 1997 video of Jobs  I realized we had to include it in this guide   I don t know  maybe this guy knows something about brand  Let s hear him out   The video is worth watching for a few reasons  First  it s unpolished  Jobs was a fantastic speaker  and here you get to see him without the trappings of an iPhone event  Second  he s addressing Apple employees  not the world  It s a behind the scenes video from before Apple s resurgence  which is very cool to see  And finally  it s completely on topic for your Brand Sprint  This is the moment where Jobs explains Apple s why and its importance to their products  advertising  and sales  Today   20 years later    the why is still relevant   One more classic example is Nike   Also a bit obvious and overdone  but so good I can t resist   Here s a quote from Phil Knight s Shoe Dog about the earliest days of Nike  in 1964    I d been unable to sell encyclopedias  and I d despised it to boot  I d been slightly better at selling mutual funds  but I d felt dead inside  So why was selling shoes so different  Because  I realized  it wasn t selling  I believed in running  I believed that if people got out and ran a few miles every day  the world would be a better place  and I believed these shoes were better to run in  People  sensing my belief  wanted some of that belief for themselves  Belief  I decided  Belief is irresistible    Today  more than 50 years later  Nike stands for pretty much the exact same thing  Here s their current mission statement   Bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete  in the world    If you have a body  you are an athlete   Coming up with a great why sounds basic  It s not  It s surprisingly hard  Encourage your CEO or founder to be idealistic and remember why they started this company or took this job  We spend most of our time at the office being pragmatic  This is not a time to be pragmatic   it s a time to wear your heart on your sleeve,"[1330 893 1064 154 561 275 51 1316 1169 478 595]"
1349,training-dataset/business/1443.txt,business,Do You Want to Truly Understand Your Audience  Do This One Thing In this guest blog post  Shawn Parrotte  Marketing Manager at Designli and friend of the Founder Institute  describes what tech startups can do to understand their audience and how to capitalize on their findings   It s safe to say many businesses start from the thought   wouldn t it be cool if     We ve all been in that moment  It s an evening relaxing with some friends  probably over drinks  Someone  in a fit of inspiration  bursts out   I ve been thinking  you know  why has no one ever made       You can fill in the blank with any number of ideas you ve had over your lifetime   Everyone follows up  in a fit of excitement  with how amazing the thing would be  how it s so obvious but no one s thought of it  and how there has to be millions of dollars to be made with it   And while most times these  aha moments  never materialize anything  maybe the excitement fades or everyone realizes the idea was really that spectacular to begin with  some do actually commit to making the idea into reality  Commit to building a business  creating a venture  and being an entrepreneur   The Skill of Entrepreneurship  I think it s important to never stifle someone s entrepreneurial spirit  but budding entrepreneurs should remind themselves that entrepreneurship is also a skill that needs to be cultivated and may take time to develop  It s a deeper way of thinking about the world and the needs of those in it   Why do I say this  Because there are too many tales of ventures that failed because they didn t take the necessary time to figure out their product market fit  They ultimately closed their doors for good because they didn t understand their users well enough and what their actual needs were  Truly understanding your potential customers is an essential skill that any entrepreneur needs to have to run a sustainable business   For example  consider Homejoy  a startup that was riding on the  uber for x  wave  They offered home cleaning on demand and by 2013 raised  38 million for their rapid expansion to new markets  Their story ended soon after when they closed up shop mid 2015 because they tried to grow too fast without understanding the needs of the market   It s very easy to get excited about building the next great app  or pioneering the next innovative business solution  but you get there by responding to real market needs  not ignoring them  You you need to know your users and know them well   A savvy entrepreneur might challenge this idea quoting Steve Jobs  infamous  people don t know what they want until you show it to them   so how do you marry his idea with knowing your users   Let Your Audience Show You What They Want  There s a goldmine of customer research right under our noses  where people s wants and needs are being expressed openly  and you can tap into it by spending the time to find where to look and listening to the conversations with empathy and humility  And you can do it all while conveniently behind your computer screen   And you d be surprised how simple it is  All it requires is spending quality time browsing the forums  groups  and other online hangouts that your users frequent   One strange thing about learning a new skill is that new things become apparent that were always already in front of you the whole time  For instance  if you re learning about typography  you can be keenly aware of the kerning  x height  contrast  ascenders  descenders  etc   in the font types around you  The same thing can happen when you re keenly tuned into the kinds of conversations that your target audience has  by being a fly on the wall in the spaces they naturally habit  You can act as a digital anthropologist deeply studying your potential customers and the motivations behind their conversations  finding out what problems they have that the market isn t currently solving so you can then solve them in an innovative way   So instead of mindlessly browsing Reddit like you might do on your work break  go there to deeply study the threads that spark the most intense conversations  Notice when topics are brought up over and over again  Commit to truly understanding them  The answer to what your target audience needs likely won t be explicitly stated  but if you practice empathy by putting yourself in their shoes  listening to what kinds of emotions and feelings are behind what they re writing  I bet you can begin to put together some solutions to their problems   Once you become involved enough in the community  feel free to ask questions in a natural and non suspicious way  If you get crafty  you may be able to create threads that answer the right questions that could guide your product development  Do this enough and you may be able to find more than a handful of great ideas   Other venues for doing some serious customer research include Quora  Stack Exchange  Medium  and any of the myriad forums dedicated to all sorts of niche topics  By finding these hang outs and becoming part of the community you can authentically speak to your audience with exactly what they re looking for   Making an App  Create an MVP to Test What You ve Learned   Your preliminary research will leave you more knowledgeable than you originally were before  however  you ll only really be able to know if you re product works how you intend it by getting it in the hands of the people it s made for  So why not create a minimal viable product  MVP  to test your product market fit   An MVP is your idea at a scaled down  minimal service that allows you test the market to see if your solution resonates with your ideal customer  see how they use your potential solution  and learn if the idea is something they ll end up shelling out money for at all   It would be beneficial to talk to a developer and discuss your idea in full  The agency you go with can help you determine the absolute necessary features your MVP will need before you dive into the full release of your product   Even if you imagine a great idea  a poorly executed plan and design can affect its success  Always do a good amount of research before you get going  and if you suspect there s enough need for your idea  or discover you need to change your idea to match the market landscape an MVP might be

1360,training-dataset/business/272.txt,business,Edelman s Lucy Allen on PR for startupsA great product released at the perfect time still needs two things to succeed   attention and credibility  Whether you re trying to attract users  establish trust or grab the attention of potential investors  you re going to need to spread your startup s story   and that means getting a handle on PR  To explore how to do just that  I had a chat with Lucy Allen  General Manager and Head of Bay Area at Edelman  a leading global communications and PR firm  Lucy s spent the past two decades working with technology companies of all sizes   from young startups to the likes of SAP and Adobe   to build their profile and share their stories  Our conversation covers what actually makes something newsworthy  why conversational interfaces are changing the PR paradigm and much more  If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the interview  but if you re short on time  here are five key takeaways  Conversational interfaces are a place where company reputations will be formed and users perceptions will be created  As a result  product builders need to work with the communications team to shape the experience  Business media cover two things  people and money  If your story can t talk about the people whose lives it s affecting  or doesn t talk about money in a way that s meaningful to consumers or shows how you are moving markets  it s going to difficult getting it picked up  When a startup doesn t have vast numbers of customers or a large partner ecosystems to talk about yet  the story of its founders is key to establishing credibility  The communications goal for a Series A company is to gain credibility and an understanding of your technology  The Series B and C stages focus on lead and revenue generation  Social media affects every department in your organization  so having an expert owner or group will help move your overall digital strategy forward  Jennifer Kutz  Lucy  welcome to the show  You have about 20 years of PR and communications experience in the Bay Area  Can you give us just a quick overview of your career trajectory and the types of clients that you ve worked with  Lucy Allen  As you said  20 years in technology  predominantly marketing and PR for technology companies  I actually started my career in the U K  working with large brands like SAP and BT  but in the 14 years that I ve been in the Bay Area  I ve predominantly worked with startups and late stage private companies in a range of tech fields  More recently in my role at Edelman  we re working with companies across a range of sectors  There s a strong presence in technology but also in healthcare  consumer goods  consumer services  food  beverage  and education and finance  Where product and PR intersect Jennifer  One of the reasons we were excited to have you on the show was a recent blog post you wrote about chatbots  In this scenario we are characterizing a bot as any conversation that happens between a business and a consumer through a messaging interface with a level of automation  This could be through a concierge service  a customer support scenario  or even ordering a pizza through Facebook Messenger  In your opinion  what role should communications play in a chatbot strategy  Lucy  Communicators need to recognize that a lot of news consumption will happen through chatbots in the future  It s already happening  Messaging apps have overtaken social networks in terms of monthly active users  Think about how much news we consume or have consumed through social networks and how much we re likely to be consuming through bots  As a communicator you need to be ahead of that  The bigger picture here is that this is an indicator of a general trend towards the fusion of PR with product  It s no longer the case that PR s job or a communicator s job is to wait until the product is fully baked and then promote it  It s our job to really understand and implement and be part of the product itself  With the chatbot  the channel of communication is actually part of the experience the user has with that brand  It s part of the core service the company is providing  Reputations will be formed and perceptions created at the chatbot interface  It s really important  from a communicator s perspective  that experience is aligned with the overall perception and reputation that you want to create for your company   Jennifer  How should a chatbot s voice and tone mesh with the overall brand  Lucy  We re still in the early days  I don t believe that we ve established best practices yet  At Edelman we estimate there are 50 to 100 large brands that have a messaging app of some sort  There s an opportunity for people to build a significant audience by getting in early  A lot of the media companies were the first to try this  Wall Street Journal and Business Insider  for example  do a good job of engaging with their audiences in a way that is aligned with the editorial voice that they re very well known for  and that s consistent across their other channels  They re a good example  When it comes to non media brands  a lot of those organizations range widely  Many are using bots for a particular function to help create a sense of an exclusive community   alerts and special offers and promotions   and those include brands all the way from luxury retailers like Burberry through to the NFL  Everybody s learning  I don t think there are examples yet that we can point to of people that have made catastrophic mistakes  In my blog post I highlighted that a company  Slack  experimented with a more humorous tone of voice  which ended up not resonating  and so they adapted  That s an example of the kind of learning experience that all brands are going through  Jennifer  In the world of PR we talk a lot about various sorts of media   paid media  owned media  earned media  We tend to be a lot more focused on the earned media side of things  In your post you mentioned that chatbots are in a new area  which you have characterized as  experienced media   How do you define that term and what do you see as the opportunity there for startups  Lucy  Experienced media or experiential media is really more of a trend where we see the channel of communication fusing with the experience of the core product or service that the brand is providing  Another example is virtual reality or augmented reality  We think about chatbots as conversational experiences  Edelman issued its annual digital trends report at the end of December  and there s actually a chapter in there for anyone who s interested in learning more about how chatbots can affect the way communication works  The big opportunity there is that through those conversational experiences  we ll start to see them introduced into the home through  hearables  and devices like the Amazon Echo  or into cars  They re already strongly present throughout the office through enterprise collaboration applications and tools  They re already available on mobile devices  of course  That is one reason why these conversational experiences represent such a significant opportunity for communicators  The ability to get in front of a much wider audience and to be much more pervasive and connected to the way we live our lives  Telling your startup s story Jennifer  You ve worked with quite a few in startups in the past  When is the best time for a startup to build out its PR plan  How do they know they re ready  Lucy  Like all good communicators  my answer is  it depends   It depends on how you define PR  If you re defining it in an old school way  as just media relations  then the answer is you re ready when you have a really strong story to tell  However  PR is not really just media relations anymore  In today s society  as we all know  we have to earn attention and credibility  It can t be just bought or demanded  As a result  earning attention is part of any aspect of marketing  In content marketing  for example  you have to make sure that your content stands for itself and will earn attention from readers  If you look at it through that lens  you re ready from the get go  Every organization needs some level of  PR   because everybody needs to earn the right kind of attention or credibility at some point  Jennifer  You should always be thinking about a reputation unless you re deliberately not trying to have a reputation yet  PR is not just media relations anymore  Lucy  Absolutely  there may be reasons why you re in stealth or you re very laser focused on a particular set of limited customers  Even then you should be thinking about not necessarily going out and promoting yourself and beating your chest  but about earning credibility  This takes us on the topic of trust  Mistrust and fear in our society are at unprecedented levels  As we ve seen from numerous articles over the past few months  the technology industry will continue to bear some of the blame for that  All tech companies  all sizes  need to be prepared for that  need to be able to look around the corner and ensure that the way they re positioning themselves is going to resonate well with their community  demonstrate they have empathy and help offset potential negative consequences down the line  Jennifer  What characterizes a really strong story  In other words  what s newsworthy and what s something that you can rely on to take to the press  Lucy  News is the psychology of the unexpected  If your news story doesn t pass the  so what   test then it s not a news story  If it doesn t somehow surprise the reader or tell them something they didn t already know  then it s not news  As an internal communicator or a communicator of any sort  you really need to be harsh on yourself when assessing the value of your news  The other way I think about this is  business media typically writes about just two things  people and money  If your story doesn t have a strong human element and can t talk about the people whose lives it s affecting  or it doesn t talk about money in a way that s meaningful to individuals  to consumers  or that shows how you are moving markets  then it probably doesn t have the right ingredients for a news story  That s a good guide mark to ensure that you don t just get lost in the weeds of your product  but that you think about the wider ramifications of your story     Anchoring your startup s story to money  people or both is the key to getting the attention of business media  Jennifer  You ve spoke about how news stories typically fall into several buckets  There s the big buckets of money and people  but you also said a news story can be characterized as novelty  celebrity  scandal  hardship and danger to the community  I always found that a really useful guideline  Lucy  A lot of those can sound very negative  The art is figuring out how to take something that can feel like a negative  like hardship or danger to the community  and figuring out how that can be applied to you  It doesn t actually mean that you have to be telling negative stories or piggybacking on negative stories  You just need to think about what s going to surprise and deliver something new  Jennifer  If as a company you re undergoing a hardship or you maybe failed in some way that isn t fundamental to the company  a lot of startups in my experience are pretty reticent to share those experiences  They tend to make the best stories  Now that we re in this time where there s a lot more skepticism and big companies have publicly failed  I think credibility is a much bigger issue  authenticity is something that people are really looking for  Startups that can share those tales of   Hey  we screwed up  Here s how we fixed it and here s what we learned   Lucy  You re absolutely right  If you look at storytelling over centuries  every story has a story arc  You can t have a story arc without there being some kind of hero struggle  an obstacle for the protagonist to overcome  If you don t have the arc  you just have a flat line  That s not exciting for anybody  News is the  psychology  of the unexpected  To your point specifically  a startup may not have vast numbers of customers or great big partner ecosystem to talk about yet  What you do have is your founders  A lot of the value for those private companies comes from the credibility of the founders  The founders  story  and not just the story of founding the particular company that you re working on at the moment  but the founders  history and credibility  is really important  You can tell that in a series of resume like bullet points  You should also tell that through the form of your own personal story  What are some of the challenges that you ve faced  That will resonate much more  The three stages of PR needs Jennifer  A lot of startups  especially once they become VC funded  think about enlisting a PR agency  How does a company know whether that s the right decision for them  What s the pros and cons of perhaps keeping PR in house or working with an agency  Does company size affect that in some way  Lucy  There are typically three phases that a startup goes through in terms of their communications needs  For the sake of simplicity  I ll tie that to the different funding rounds  although of course it s different for every organization  At Series A  your needs are usually more focused around getting credibility and understanding of your technology  Your proposition is likely to be not part of an existing category  If it is a part of an existing category  it s at least a new perspective on it  There s some education to be done  Getting attention early on is all about making sure there s an understanding with your very specific target audiences of what it is you re trying to communicate  That may be best done internally  because those are the people who have an understanding of the technology or the products or the proposition  That said  that s also the phase where you have a small team  You may not have a marketer or a communications expert in house  so you many need to turn to somebody externally to help you take that message and communicate it  Second phase  B and C rounds  is when you re more likely to be very focused on revenue generation  Almost everything you re doing is geared around lead generation  customers  partners  The type of PR that you do will change and it needs to be tied in very tightly to your content marketing and lead generation programs  At that point  the needs become a little bit more complex and where you might need an agency is if you need specialist expertise  You re starting to need a broader range of expertise and skill sets in house and you may not have all of those  You might keep some of it in house but you might work with an agency to bring in some of those capabilities  The third stage  once you start to get to D and E rounds  expansion  stage funding  that s when you re likely to be transitioning from a single product to a multi product company  You may be looking to expand internationally  You may be thinking about a liquidity event  All of those things require not only additional expertise  you also need to work with somebody who s done that before  Or they work with an agency partner to help them go through that process  Once you start to look at regulatory challenges and more complex international communication challenges  the safety net of knowing that somebody has done it before is really important  The state of social media Jennifer  Social media is still hugely important and a big part of many companies  marketing and communication programs  A while ago it was held up as this Holy Grail of the future of PR and marketing  Things have changed pretty rapidly  In my opinion it has turned largely into a paid platform  It s hard to get a lot of attention unless you either have a very  very big audience  which many startups are not going to have for a long time   if ever  or you re throwing some money behind it  What are your thoughts on that  Is messaging going to take that on  Will messaging become what we hoped social media would be  Lucy  There is a lot of content pollution  The other issue that s affecting paid media is bot fraud  It cost advertisers something like  7 2 billion in 2016  That s a big concern  We are still fairly early in seeing what social media can do to help us to change the way we engage with our audiences  Is there an opportunity still to do organic social media  One of the things that social media has done is create a whole new generation of influences  I think organizations right now are really just starting to understand how best to work with those influences  Some of that s paid  some of it s not  That ll continue  One of the other things that we ll see happen as a result of the concerns about ad blocking  bot fraud  and fake news  is a move towards more tangible but still digital forms of communications and advertising  Out of home digital advertising is one  podcasting is another  We ll start to see more of that happening  Jennifer  On a more practical level  social media ownership is something I ve seen every company do a little bit differently  Maybe they ve got a dedicated owner in charge of social  Sometimes it s the step child that is not really owned by anyone  Other times different parts of it are owned by different parts of an organization  What  in your experience  tends to work the best  Lucy  Where we ve seen it work the best is when you have a social media center of excellence or practice expert  You have a team of people or an individual who  depending on your size  is constantly studying the latest developments and best practices and can provide that expertise across the organization,"[1360 1174 561 1045 609 154 1314 868 1316 1390 610]"

1368,training-dataset/business/366.txt,business,Adam Grant On Interviewing to Hire Trailblazers  Nonconformists and OriginalsBestselling author and Wharton professor Adam Grant has spent years researching and interviewing originals  There s the seasoned chief executive who cusses freely and challenges candidates to apply for jobs by tweeting at her  Or the author who tackles weighty topics like artificial intelligence and virtual reality with stick figure illustrations  And the former spy who founded an airline and is betting on Utah as the next big tech hub  In Originals  Grant shows how to identify  foster and nurture nonconformists   here he expounds on how to recognize and recruit them in a startup setting   As a former magician and Junior Olympic springboard diver  Grant is in the company of the curious  versatile brethren he s profiled  But for those seeking conventional curriculum vitae  he s got that in spades  too  Grant is perennially recognized as Wharton s top rated professor and has been named one of the world s 25 most influential management thinkers  He s spoken to and consulted with a range of organizations  from Google to Johnson   Johnson and from Pixar to the U S  Army  A prolific writer  Grant is the author of Give and Take  an active blogger and a contributing op ed writer for The New York Times   In this interview  Grant explains why it s imperative for early stage companies to hire originals  He shares how he singles them out and delves into recommended questions and exercises that can help startups find and hire them   The Case to Hire Originals at Startups  The initial act of founding a company is an expression of nonconformity  They must eventually convince others to join them  internalize that vision and will it into reality  But isn t it counterintuitive to bring other originals   who may buck their ideas   into the fold    It s true that every leader needs followers  We can t all be nonconformists at every moment  but conformity is dangerous   especially for an entity in formation   says Grant   If you don t hire originals  you run the risk of people disagreeing but not voicing their dissent  You want people who choose to follow because they genuinely believe in ideas  not because they re afraid to be punished if they don t  For startups  there s so much pivoting that s required that if you have a bunch of sheep  you re in bad shape    Here s more of Grant s thinking on why it s so essential to bring aboard originals early in the life of a company   To seed a resilient culture  By default  companies are built in the image of their founders  which is why it s vital to proactively introduce diversity of thought   A resilient culture has a certain amount of resistance embedded in it  Not too much to capsize it  but enough so that it doesn t atrophy   says Grant   What happens when startups get successful and grow is that they become more and more vulnerable to the attraction selection attrition cycle  where people of the same stripes are increasingly drawn to the organization  chosen by it and retained at it  The way to combat that homogeneity creep is to proactively infuse the culture with originals  who have the will and skill to think differently  It ll put you in a much better position to continue innovating  not only on a product  or technology level  but all the decisions that go into running a company    To anticipate market movements  The more you can internally mirror the evolving market you re aiming to change  the better you will manage it   As mentioned  if you only hire people who fit your values and business model  you re going to end up breeding groupthink and losing diversity of thought   says Grant   That s a great way to ensure that you ll be left in the dust as soon as your world changes around you  competitors enter the market or new technologies develop  You need originals to keep bringing fresh ideas that can challenge your current business model  your assumptions and your principles  That accelerates your ability to adapt to   or better yet  initiate   change  as opposed to getting caught by surprise    To repurpose dissent  From the company name to a go to market plan  the early stages of a startup are rife with big decisions  A diversity of thought on the way forward will mean some ideas will get scrapped  The key is to not let the owners of those ideas get left behind  too   After Toy Story  Pixar co founder Ed Catmull was worried that the animation studio would start following a predictable formula to get its big wins  So as not to lose its originality  he brought in outside director Brad Bird  Bird convened all the disgruntled Pixar employees   the ones who are always whining and complaining   says Grant   Instead of ushering them to the door  Bird s instinct was that they d be so dissatisfied that they d think in new ways and try ideas that hadn t been considered  He supplied a tiny budget and set them free  The result was a new illustration technique that d keep Pixar s standard  but could be executed more quickly and at a fraction of the cost  The proof in the pudding was one of Pixar s blockbuster hits  The Incredibles    If you re five or 500 people  hire as many originals as you can  Yes  there are risks of hiring too many originals   but it s even riskier to hire too few   Where to Search for Originals   And How to Spot Them  When Grant wrote his book  he collected data and stories of nonconformists to illustrate what it means to be original   not unlike an entrepreneur choosing a founding team to advance her vision  As he researched and received referrals  a few profiles habitually emerged  Here s how and where he surfaced originals   and what tipped him off   Unsung heroes  For each major innovation or movement  there are catalysts that fade into the background of what they create  The fire is brighter than the match   or it burns up with it   I took examples of breakthroughs and traced back to pinpoint the unsung heroes  For example  I knew I wanted to write about the suffrage movement and who really drove that change   says Grant   That s when I learned of Lucy Stone  I had never heard of her   but there was likely no one more vital to the movement  You may not know of her because Susan B  Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton eventually severed their ties to her  But she was the outright original for women s rights  for which she launched newspapers  led conventions and mobilized movements internationally  She was also the first woman to earn a bachelor s degree in Massachusetts  keep her name after getting married and become a full time lecturer for women s rights    Insubordinates  It s important to triage troublemakers  but in doing so  don t miss an original in your midst   Another approach that I took was to look for people who had engaged in very visible acts of nonconformity  I had a funny conversation with a military general where I asked for a list of people who were most guilty of insubordination   says Grant   I had to add a qualifier  I said   I want to know who was insubordinate but ended up actually being a great innovator   The person that annoyed middle managers but was valued by higher ups  That led to a lot of really good names and a few crazy people    In a startup setting  this may mean rewiring your thinking about those who have been fired   Take Sarah Robb O Hagan  She held senior roles at both Virgin and Atari and got fired at both  A deadbeat right  Afterwards  she got a job at Nike and then became the president of Gatorade and Equinox   says Grant   When she guest spoke at my class  she swore six times in the first five minutes  Early on  she talked very openly about being fired and how devastating it was to her career  but how we should all be more willing to take risks and make mistakes  Sara doesn t worry about pleasing others or fitting in  At Gatorade  she championed many ideas that nobody liked  For one  she said it shouldn t be just a sports drink  but a sports performance company  Everyone hated those ideas    until they eventually rescued the brand    Inward facing innovators  People notice public  original acts  but nonconformists also turn their original thinking toward their teams  making a private  but equally profound impact   One of the first names noted when listing nonconformists is Nancy Lublin  She s taken an atypical approach to building and marketing her companies  such as Crisis Text Line  Who would have thought that you could prevent suicide using text messages   asks Grant   But  as impressively  she prompts her people to act originally by banning words such as like  love and hate  because  as a basic visceral response  they circumvent any critical thought  Saying why something is loved or hated inspires new  substantial ideas  She inspires originality in her people    Another example that comes to mind for Grant is Wade Eyerly   Wade not only worked in politics and the Defense Intelligence Agency  but also is a serial entrepreneur  most notably of airline startup SurfAir  How many people would ve thought to do a flight over a distance that you could travel by bike or car  It s a pretty counterintuitive idea that he brought to life   says Grant   But it s also his leadership practices that are highly original  as he hires almost exclusively non local talent   often from Utah  Whereas most leaders want people who are local and easy to recruit  Wade believes that those who relocate for his company build their community around it  creating even stronger job embeddedness     Values over rules are key for encouraging originality    How to Interview For Originals  If you re a founder building out your team  you may not have a wealth of time or data to suss out originals  It can be difficult to see if there s substance beneath surface indications of nonconformity  Organized by three key attributes of originals  here are unconventional questions and exercises to use to help validate an original   CHALLENGES DEFAULTS  How would you improve our interview process   I find this question powerful for a couple of reasons  One  it s an opportunity to see if they re willing to speak up  Two  it s a window into their thinking process  When they encounter something that they don t like  do they have the instinct not only to raise why it may be broken but also suggest how it can be better   asks Grant   It s a chance to learn about their tendency to share opinions that might be unpopular but beneficial  It gives you a little bit of perspective on their ability and inclination to improve their environment    Tell me about the last time that you encountered a rule in an organization that you thought made no sense  What was the rule  What did you do and what was the result   You re not excited about candidates who just let it go  But you also don t want somebody who says   Yeah I saw this rule  marched into my boss  office  argued and quit over it   says Grant   What you re looking for is somebody who says   I saw this rule that I thought didn t make sense  I first did some research to figure out how it was created and why it was this way  I spoke to a couple of people who d been at the organization longer than I had  asking if they knew what it was initially set out to do  If they didn t know  I reached out to some people who have influence and sought their advice on ways forward to improve the rule and made a few suggestions on how  I got tasked to lead the committee to change the rule  We made a change and here s the evidence that we had an impact   That s an original who s learned to be a tempered radical    Why shouldn t I hire you   In Originals  I talk about founder Rufus Griscom  who pitched his startup Babble to investors by listing three reasons not to invest in his business  Sarah Robb O Hagan once opened her job application the same way  describing why she shouldn t be hired  In one breath  she outlined which qualifications she didn t meet  but also why she was suited to do it anyway   says Grant   She challenges the job description and shows that she can bring something different than what a company thinks it needs  Part of why this worked is that  in one fell swoop  she shows extreme awareness  not only of her abilities  but also of the proposed requirements   and why some don t really matter    It s your first few months on the job  What questions would you first ask and to whom  Presidential candidates are often asked what they plan to accomplish in their first 100 days in office  and hiring managers tend to evaluate candidates for leadership positions similarly   This idea came from one of my collaborators  Reb Rebele  an applied positive psychology expert who leads many of our hiring projects   says Grant   He observed that when new people are coming in  their first few months should be as much about learning as doing  Originals distinguish themselves by asking questions that no one else has thought to ask  and posing them to people who have fresh perspectives to offer  Ask candidates what questions they d want to ask in their first two months on the job  and who their ideal sources would be  Listen for examples of open ended questions   rather than just yes no or testing my own thinking styles of inquiry   as well as a willingness to draw from and challenge many sources of information     Originals are constructive contrarians  They re not just pointing out that the emperor has no clothes  they re also tailors    EMBODIES A MULTITUDE  Start at the bottom of the CV  Above the bottom margin of the last page of each resume is typically a line about a candidate s hobbies  travels or interests   Look for people who have multi functional backgrounds  multicultural experience and wide interests  Most hiring managers focus on depth of experience  but breadth is critical for creativity   says Grant    In a study comparing all the 21st century Nobel Prize winning scientists with their colleagues from their era  the breakthrough scientists were significantly more likely to be involved in the arts than the latter  twice as likely to play a musical instrument  seven times as likely to draw or point  twelve times as likely to write fiction or poetry  and 22 times as likely to perform as dancers  actors or magicians  Curious people are drawn to self expression  but there s also evidence that training in the arts can help you see things differently as a scientist   says Grant   In another study  the most innovative fashion designers were distinguished by experience abroad   not traveling or living abroad  but time working abroad   which gave them opportunities to incorporate new concepts into their designs  Originals are fusions of their varied interests  They are multidisciplinary makers  thinkers and doers    Look for diversity of role models   and distribution of their impact   Asking a candidate what his role model would do is a way to assess how he thinks outside his own perspective  Yet how many people now are thinking from first principles by asking what would Elon Musk do in this situation   asks Grant   The challenge is not to get locked into one of those examples but to internalize and cycle through multiple people s thought processes  That s actually the way that I was taught to contribute knowledge as a researcher  I d review my work from the perspectives of a few of my mentors   Jane Dutton  Brian Little  Rick Price   and imagine what questions they would ask  Internalizing these perspectives leads to a more convincing set of ideas  often with new  original insights  That process helps you move beyond the limitations of your instincts  Originals find role models who think differently and can read about or learn from them directly    Uncover their roads not taken  Originals are supremely prolific  The London Philharmonic Orchestra selected the 50 greatest classical music compositions  The list included six pieces from Mozart  five from Beethoven and three from Bach   To generate those masterpieces  Mozart composed 600 pieces  Beethoven created 650 and Bach produced over a thousand compositions  A broader study showed that the more pieces a composer created over a five year window  the greater the chances of a hit   says Grant   One way to produce great  new ideas is to come up with more of them  But what we surface on resumes and interviews are a filtered set of ideas and interests   and likely those that led to desired outcomes  Ask candidates   What did you try but ultimately give up on   and why   Look for those who demonstrate continuous curiosity  but a willingness to move on when the writing s on the wall    Make the candidate a culture detective   Beyond asking how to improve the interview process  assess how candidates view your company culture   says Grant   Two weeks before her interview  give a candidate three names of colleagues to reach out to learn more about the culture  Tell her that when she comes in  you want to know what s working and what needs to be changed  You can also run this exercise same day if candidates are on site for a half day or more  You can learn a tremendous amount from the adjustments they suggest  and the questions they ask your colleagues and you might pick up some useful ideas along the way    DEMONSTRATES INSISTENCE AND RESILIENCE  Present a problem   but leave out a piece of information   One of the things we know is that originality occurs at the nexus of curiosity and grit  So after clearing the technical parts of the interview  ask them to solve a problem in which there s a helpful piece of information missing   say Grant   Consider data that they could eventually solve the problem without  but would arrive at a solution faster if equipped with it  Originals constantly ask questions as opposed to just giving answers  Once they ve locked onto a problem  you want them to be resourceful and persistent in seeking the information they need to solve it  Originals don t give up in the face of obstacles  they find ways around or through them     Present originals with a tough problem  Focus less on the content of their solution  and more on their attitude and fervor in attacking the challenge    Evaluate the response to difficult situations   In Give and Take  I covered the ways you can distinguish a selfish taker from a generous giver  Research shows that people often project their own motivations onto others  Takers tend to anticipate more taking from others because they start by asking themselves what they d do  For example  when asked how common it is for people to steal from their employers  takers give higher estimates of theft   says Grant   Ask candidates what they think the common response would be to various types of frustrating and dissatisfying situations  The originals are the ones who expect that people would be motivated to take initiative and change the situation    In which job were you most miserable  Why and how did you deal with it   This not only gauges attitude  but also reveals the triggers of discontent  If hiring originals  I want people who are frustrated by red tape more than people who are bored   says Grant   People who say   This work is boring  I hate it  are less likely to bring originality than those who say   I don t like it  but I m going to fix it     NOTES ON EVALUATING ORIGINALS  Corral references until they re candid   References can be a rich source of information to use to identify originals  but one of my big frustrations with references is that they re always glowing  Nobody ever gets a negative review  You have to put references in a position where they have no choice but to be candid with you   says Grant   The easiest way to do that is to give them forced choices of two undesirable attributes  Try asking   From your vantage point  if this candidate were going to rock the boat too often or not often enough  which is more likely   If you phrase the question correctly  it s not clear what the  correct  answer is  But I d suggest looking carefully at the ones who rock the boat too often as potential diamonds in the rough    Use a prepared scoring key   When seeking out specific qualities   such as those of originals   research supports evaluating responses using a scoring key  For instance  it s much more effective to use a sliding scale to assess a person s ability to challenge the status quo  than a yes or no answer   says Grant   Consider rating them on a 1 5 scale  Originality stems from both novelty and usefulness  so we want to measure both of those factors independently  How novel are her suggestions  How practical  A third dimension might be also how the suggestions are communicated  Another is how eagerly the candidate is trying to please the interviewer  an indication that he or she may not be challenging enough  You are looking for multi dimensional people  so your scoring rubric must accommodate that reality     If a candidate sees a problem and isn t able to get heard  will she give up or take it four levels up the org chart    Identifying originals is only the initial step  but it s a supremely significant one  It not only keeps you rigorous when forming your foundational team  but also indicates to candidates that you are an organization that seeks out and values original thinking and action  Originals are essential to help seed a resilient culture and respond to market diversity and movement  They are often unsung heroes  insubordinates and those who lean toward putting their creative ideas into action  To find them  pepper in Grant s questions to test how frequently they challenge defaults  demonstrate perseverance and synthesize the multitude of sources around them    In my research on originals  I ve learned of people who have used dogs  chew toys as erasers in a pinch or reimagined rollerblades as ways to tell time  These are minor  isolated examples  but they illustrate a greater force at play   says Grant   The world is full of ordinary objects and ideas that are made extraordinary by people who have the capacity to repurpose and reapply them  MacGyver style  It often starts with a slight recalibration in perspective followed by a small  but defiant act  It s the originals who keep pulling on that thread   they instinctively know that that s the difference between inspiration and innovation  Don t you want those people building beside you    Illustration by Alejandro Garcia

more broader point about trying to find a good problem to solve   is that scheduling is a different thing to different people  You have businesses who want to schedule in their customers because that s the hour or the day they are providing a service and they re working  so they are photographers or gardeners or beauty therapists or trainers or people who are providing usually face to face services  There s a whole element of e commerce associated with that and a lot of support to the customer  the end booker themselves they want follow up on   John  You were kind enough to be on our

problem it solves is how to find a time to meet for a group of people  We built this very simple interface  everybody fills out their times and you send the link around and then by magic the system will tell you what date or hour everyone can make  Then what we found was that people were trying to stab away at that golden spot and secure it and say   Well that s the slot I want to book   We found that by building essentially a backend integration with Google Calendar people could do that  they could select the slot and then book it into their calendars   John Collins  Our guest today is

beforehand and why did you choose this problem to solve   My chat with Bridget covers bootstrapping your way to profitability  why VC interests may not always align with the founders   how her busking days shaped the way she runs a startup  and more  If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed    Bridget  who in a previous life was could be found busking in London s Covent Garden and in tube stations  is the co founder and CEO of You Can Book Me  It s a SaaS tool for quick and easy online scheduling that she launched with her husband in 2010  Today  YouCanBook me has  1 million in ARR  turns a profit and has more than 10 000 customers   including the likes of Atlassian  Box  Indeed and Shopify  And against conventional startup wisdom  Bridget and her team made this happen without taking any VC funding   Bridget  center left  speaking on the startup panel at Inside Intercom London   It s small to medium businesses and it s a huge  huge market but it s pretty tough to get into because as soon as you realize you ve got the right tool for beauty therapists you ve got the wrong tool for photographers  for example  A lot of companies that started to use YouCanBook me in the early days  I have to confess  we had not quite anticipated it  It was the sort of thing which naturally grew because people could see that the value of Google Calendar  they were using it to book in client meetings  so recruitment  sales  customer success  etc  A lot of companies now will use YouCanBook me and indeed other tools to sort that problem out  People are booking demos or they re booking support calls using our tool   Another interesting use case of YouCanBook me  which again took off very naturally in America because a lot of schools had adopted Google for education  is that schools will use us for parent teacher conferences where they can spool out hundreds of calendars for each teacher to handle 10 minute slots  We actually have a very strong education and nonprofit dimension to our tool as well   Opting for a bootstrapped approach  John  An interesting aspect of your business is that you decided not to take VC funding along the way  What attracted you to that different route these days  given that venture capitalists seem to be looking for a lot of good homes for money   Bridget  We would never say never and we ve never been closed to conversations  but on the other hand it wasn t an  either or  when we set out  The CTO and developer of YouCanBook me is Keith  my husband  so the two of us have formed a partnership over the years of building these products  YouCanBook me and When is Good weren t the first products that we built  Previously we had a survey building tool  which was completely different  We were working on digital products and various kinds of web applications for a long time before we knew we were building a business or indeed we actually had a successful product on our hand   YouCanBook me emerged out of a lot of experience building products  Then once we d built the product  could see it was working  had that famous product market fit and people are paying us for it  we had to figure out how we re actually going to make money  We started to build a company around the fact that we could make money and we could be profitable  Now we ve got more than  1million ARR and we re profitable  We ve taken a long view about how to build from an idea to a product through to making money  Along the way the VC intervention might have helped   I m not saying that there s not companies that haven t been hugely helped by taking on investment   but for us it always felt like the wrong moment for a number of reasons       One of the benefits of venture capital I ve seen  even at Intercom  is that it opens up this network of people  Your VCs can connect you with other people in their portfolios  companies who ve been through similar problems  As someone who s bootstrapped  do you ever find that s a challenge  getting those sources of guidance or that network that can help you   Bridget  There s certainly a risk that if you re bootstrapped and you re small then you can become quite insular  Keith and I are more at risk because we re a married couple  You can get very personal  very insular and in some ways the one direction you could go in is what they call a lifestyle business where you re not really interested in talking to anybody else and you just want to build something that is going to work for you and you re not referencing the outside world   I deliberately tried to protect us from an insular perspective  so you do what everybody does  you read loads of books  Once you ve got past some advice and business case studies  which are around companies that did go down a course of rounds of funding  all business advice really comes down to the same basic principle  how are you going to make money and how are you not going to fall over  You read all of those books  you follow the blogs  you go to conferences  you reach out to people  As I said  I ve been very open   when VCs have contacted me I always chat to them  It s always good to get their perspective and to see if the conversation is going to go anywhere   VC s advice is not always going to be the best advice for your business   We do have some longstanding advisors who have seen us through over the years  many a time when me and Keith have wondered what on earth we re doing  When you find yourself trying to explain how you ve decided to solve a problem to somebody else who you trust and admire and you realize that you sound a bit ridiculous  you think oh  I better figure that out  We re always  always learning  We ve hired lots of people who have come with them lots of experience of working with other companies  We re very open that we need to learn as a company and as a team about how to grow and not take anything for granted  The fact that we don t have the external board of investors doesn t mean we re not open to external ideas   There is some skepticism sometimes about the advice that VCs are going to give you because their interests are not necessarily aligned to your interests  Their interests are often about bringing in a growth target that is going to deliver valuations and a payout for them within the timetable of their fund  They re very open about that  it s not like that s a secret  but the fact is it might not necessarily be aligned with what you could achieve in your business separately  Put it a different way  VC s advice is not always going to be the best advice for your business  Your interest in running your business isn t always in the interests of what VCs are trying to achieve   Solving problems incrementally  John  We hear a lot of people talking these days about side projects as a way to test ideas while you ve still got the day job  It sounds like you and Keith were doing that way back before people in Silicon Valley had embraced the idea  Basically you got to try a number of different models and make your mistakes before you bet everything on YouCanBook me   Bridget  Absolutely  We had two or three web applications that we built and we always had an ambition to build a web application that was going to be successful  that people were going to use and people were going to give us money for  We were motivated by building a product that was going to make money  Obviously you do that by adding value to people s lives  you solve their problems  You identify problems and you solve them in a way that you think is going to be interesting  unique and attractive  Then people will give you money for it  That s what we always set out to do  and we did certainly have times when we realized that our technology wasn t appropriate  When we built the survey building tool it was just before a whole load of the client side technologies came out  so ours was very  very clunky and it wasn t swishy swashy  it wasn t drag and drop like Wufoo forms   We spent a lot of time on those agile and lean principles of learning from customers   You just start to think this problem that we ve chosen is just too big to bite off  If you pick a problem which is too big for you to solve by yourself  then of course you need to reach out and work with a team of people and have some financial backing   if you re absolutely sure you can solve it  Whereas when we got into When is Good and then YouCanBook me  those were problems that we realized we could put on a slow burn  We could solve them incrementally and we spent a lot of time on those agile and lean principles of learning from customers and adapting the tool based on their feedback   Certainly in the last couple of years  we ve moved towards quite a big turnover but also been profitable and hired quite a few people  What we re interested in now and what we re doing now is very different to what we were doing two or three years ago   Assembling a remote workforce  John  You ve spoken a lot about hiring  and what s interesting is you re hiring remotely  You re based just outside London  so you say to yourself it might be hard to attract people to work just outside London  but then you ve turned to remote hiring as a strength of the company   Bridget  That definitely emerged as a result of our experience of running the company and running the product and deciding what we needed to do  which happened at a much slower pace than if we d taken on VC  If we d taken on VC three or four years ago  we probably would have hired a whole load of people and expected them to come and work for us in Bedford and got an office and done all of that  or maybe moved to London  You do the playbook  you do what s expected and because we didn t follow that course  as we started to hire people it became obvious that there s plenty of talent around the world who want to work for a company like ours and we could attract them in on other measures like the technology  the product  the kind of things that we re trying to achieve   As a result of that we ve got a couple of people in the US  we ve got two people in Spain  we have somebody in Germany and quite a few people in the UK  Everybody is spread about and then we come together face to face probably sometimes two or three times a year depending on what we need to do  We built up that remote company very naturally alongside the way we ve hired people in  Once you know what kind of company you re building  you then start looking for the people who you know are going to fit into that culture   John  One of the things about hiring people remotely is they have to manage themselves  It s maybe harder to mentor them  Does that preclude certain types of people  Is it harder to bring on  say  more junior people when you re doing it remotely   Bridget  Definitely and there is no real answer to this  I ve heard from quite a few companies that work remotely that if you want to bring on an intern or a trainee or a young engineer or somebody who needs more support  it is very difficult to do that over the internet  The consequence is that we don t do that very much  We ve had a few interns and young people working for us in Bedford and that works  but it s sporadic  It s not something that we ve invested in   It s a problem I d quite like to crack because I don t think that what we re doing at the moment is going to continue to be super unusual  It s actually a very pragmatic way of attracting high quality people who want to work for you around the world  It s not necessarily a cost saving thing  it s not something to do with trying to buy cheap labor in  We employ everybody directly so we re set up as employers in the UK  in Spain and in the US and in Ireland  We directly employ people and we give them all of the benefits of working for a company full time   That is something which more and more companies will see there s a benefit to  not least because the price of office rentals in places like London are just sky high  but also going back to your earlier point about managing people  It s incumbent on us to build a company where we have a culture of expectation of high  quality  work  productivity and collaboration  which doesn t rely on you eyeballing people every day and glaring at them and making them work  That should not be the instrument by which we are successful  we should be successful because people are motivated when they work for us to do their jobs   John  Do you think it s more a technology problem that needs to be cracked  i e  VR  or is it more cultural and social issues that people just aren t used to remote working and at the moment it s only certain kind of people that are willing to take the plunge or are willing to organize themselves that way   Bridget  The tools are all there  My God  if we wanted to start using VR that would be pretty crazy  but we could  But there s plenty of fairly invasive tools  There s some tools where everybody s got a webcam and you can just click on the link and you can get a screenshot of everybody at their desk at any given point  You could have open channels through webcams all the time if you wanted to eyeball people  We have a default transparency in the company  which lots of companies like Buffer and others have advocated  and I really believe in it   If you have that kind of belief that as a company and as founders we can encourage everybody to be open  honest and collaborative about what we re trying to achieve  i e  not hierarchical or trying to hide information in order to promote yourself or your own interests against somebody else s  instead everybody takes the shared credit  If that s part of your culture and then also transparency is part of the way you communicate  then remote working should naturally fit in with that  because we want to share stuff on our chat channels and online share documents  We use video a lot when we re having meetings  Everything is naturally defaulted to sharing with people  so therefore it really doesn t matter   You need to  be open and happy to communicate   In fact  sometimes it can be a bit of a hassle if everybody s in the same office  We get very quiet and it s a bit weird and we actually stop communicating  because everybody s in the office nobody shares anything on chat  Then we start to lose touch  ironically  We use face to face stuff with our team for much more about social engagement and brainstorming and where you want to get team bonding  but day to day collaboration  it actually works better if you were using the tools  You need to be a good communicator   you need to be open and happy to communicate   John  You mentioned a number of tools there  chat  shared files  video  I noticed you didn t mention email  I understand you ve banned email as an internal communication tool at YouCanBook me  Why   Bridget  When anybody starts I send them an email to say  Look  this is how we communicate  this is our culture  these are our priorities  and by the way  don t email us   It s not necessarily a ban  it s more we encourage and essentially incentivize use of all these other tools  Nobody would think to send anybody an email because it s a very spur type of communication  Obviously any of us that have externally facing jobs use email  I only use email with colleagues when we re emailing them about an HR matter  something that s personal and confidential  That s probably a good indication of what email is good for  which is when it s got to be one to one  personal and secure and confidential  use email   John  We ve got to the stage where they are like digital letters   Bridget  Exactly  First of all  reply all drives me crazy because if you re stuck on a reply all list  you can t stop people from spamming you  There s also a bit of a passive aggressive thing that crept up  which is the bcc line  If I bcc somebody  and even if I m sending an external email  what I ve noticed  which is good practice  is if somebody starts off on an email thread and you want them to know that you replied but you don t want to spam them  you bcc them and you tell everybody you ve bcc d this person  In office environments  when you start being bcc d into things  people are creating secret communication channels  which can be quite toxic  We re a young company and none of us want to work for big corporate organizations  We ve all worked in those and we all know that it can become toxic  so we just choose not to go there   John  Speaking of toxic  what increased role does culture play when you re a remote company   Bridget  It s a basket of what I ve just said before  which is transparency  openness  the way we re building the product and we re choosing to interact with our customers  and how we re managing things  All of that attracts a certain type of person who wants to work for us  Going back to being bootstrapped  we have very open conversations with everybody in the company about how we make money  how much everybody gets paid  what the prospects of the company are  and hopefully as the company continues to be successful and profitable  those profits can go back into people s pockets   We have a jam today philosophy and people buy into that  It s different to offering the usual share options or that structural benefit of being part of a big company  Some people have worked for us and they realize that a small company doesn t work out for them  They don t work out where you re in a very small fishbowl with 10 other people  Others have really thrived and love their jobs  One of the best things about my job is when spontaneously some people on HipChat will start congratulating themselves about how much they really like their jobs   It s not something that Keith and I really expected to do when we set out  When we were building YouCanBook me we were building a product that we wanted to sell to people  Three  four years later we ve now built a company that people work for and we re having a much bigger conversation with the world about it  The culture inside does come from me and Keith originally  but also the way we have discussed with the people who joined us about how they want to continue to build YouCanBook me as a company  because as we grow and hire more people we need to be pretty sure and articulate about what it is   For example  many companies have a culture deck  We have a set of slides with bullet points covering things that we aspire to  the way we like communicating  the way we like solving problems and the things that we can default to when we re uncertain  I think when you come across something  especially in an HR situation where you realize something didn t go the way you were happy with  you ve got a document to refer to to say look  this is how we are  this is how we want to be and that wasn t consistent  Or this is not going to work out   What busking can teach us about bootstrapping  John  You had some interesting other career paths before you got into software  particularly when you busked music in Covent Garden  What did that era of your life teach you about running a startup   Bridget  My goodness  that early entrepreneurial spirit in retrospect definitely taught me a lot about the way I see my role now  It was a lot of fun  I talked about this earlier in one of my conference presentations  because I hadn t realized there was such a strong analogy  I  busked for the first time  when I was 14 as a way to make money and my first pitch was in Victoria Station in London  When you put your case down   I play the fiddle   you put the case down and you start playing  You ve got absolutely no idea if somebody s going to give you money or not   You ve decided to produce a service for somebody  playing a tune as they walk along  The first time somebody put money into my case it was just the best feeling that I had pleased somebody and that they were prepared to pay for it  After that you realize you do need to have confidence  It s quite nerve racking to start playing in public  and 25 years ago when I was busking it was a lot more scrappy than it is now  Now they have formalized pitches but when I was playing you would just walk along and find an open space in the tube system and start playing  Then you would have pitches for an hour and other buskers would come along  You learn a lot to deal with people and essentially hold your own when you re in difficulties   The longer term analogy is that the biggest thing I ve learned about running a business is that you really have to understand risk  There s a lot of rhetoric about business visionaries and leaders and  what s the magic dust to do with Richard Branson  or why do people do this in the first place  My own take on it is that you need to have a very good idea of what risk you are taking  how you define that risk and what happens if your gamble doesn t pay off  and you have to face the consequences of disaster  for example   Having that ability to not exactly know where you re going and trust an outcome that you re hoping is going to work based on your own hard work  it s a good toolkit  When I was busking  it was the same kind of thing  I still play now  I play in an Irish session band in my local pub  You re sitting there and you re listening to other people and you don t know what tunes you re about to play and then somebody else leads into something else  You start playing that and then you start learning new tunes  It s a performance  but it s a performance that has an edge to it because you don t exactly know what s going to happen  As a musician I m very comfortable with that kind of music   That s how I ve basically run the company as well  since I took over in 2012  I became the CEO to run the company because the company needed leadership and as I ve learned along the way  it s been using those kind of busking skills  you hustle sometimes  but you have to be able to play  your tunes have to sound good  I suppose   Learning from the mistakes of Westminster,"[1390 561 154 1316 51 327 1145 609 1025 667 456]"

the very least  undo months of work and obliterate your funds  Luckily  in this guest blog post  web content writer Gloria Kopp outlines some of the biggest mistakes to avoid making once your startup is up and running   There s an incredible amount of work involved in getting a startup business off the ground  In the end  the reward for all of that work is a successful business that you can be proud of  because you built it from scratch and shaped it into what it has become  But  there are some devastating mistakes that are commonly made along the way when new businesses are just getting their footings  These errors can be quite costly in terms of actual money spent  time lost and efforts wasted  and they could deter your business off of the path towards success   of completely derail it altogether   Taking things on solo  Two heads are always better than one  and the same rings true for startup businesses  Not only does it make sharing the workload and responsibilities easier  but having another person involved means that you can brainstorm ideas  get a different perspective on things and utilize each other s skillset to the advantage of the business   Of course  some people want to be true entrepreneurs  but that doesn t mean you have to be completely alone  Having freelancers  like those at Upwork  to turn to makes it easier to delegate work to a professional  so you can focus on other areas of developing your startup  while still getting everything done that needs to be done   Taking things too slow  Of course you want to make sure things are absolutely perfect before you launch your startup to the world  but there comes a point when you need to stop mulling over fine tuning every minute detail and just take the plunge  Your startup will never succeed if it s never actually launched  so do what you can to get it to a great spot  then release it to the world  It s probably never going to be absolutely flawless  but you can get it pretty close  Getting some professional proofreading help is one way to work out some of the kinks within your content  and UK Writings can certainly help you out with those services   Going too fast  On the other hand  trying to rush things and launch your startup too fast is a recipe for disaster  Have everything in line prior to launching to ensure the highest chance of success  If you re utilizing multiple social media platforms  Buffer can help you manage all of them easily  so you re ready to go as soon as the responses start coming in   Yes  you shouldn t sit around waiting for everything to be completely perfect  but on the other hand  you shouldn t try to rush things before they re ready  Releasing your product before it s ready or before you re ready to react to your customers questions and demands could be setting yourself up for failure  or at the very least  to look unprepared  unprofessional and incompetent   Take the time to ensure things are ready  including the details like testing out links in your website and proofreading your content  If you need a professional set of eyes to take a look at things  Essayroo can match you up with an expert that will point out any errors you ve made in your writing   Not knowing who exactly you re targeting  If you ve got something you think is great  you will naturally assume everyone else will love it too  But that s almost always not the case  In reality  you ve got to learn who your most receptive and interested audience is  then target your efforts towards them  No matter who you re targeting  you ve got to make sure your writing is well done  and a tool like ProWritingAid can assist you in finding errors and making corrections as you work  And  when you ve got to keep your words within a certain limit  whether it s a character limit for Twitter  or a general word range for blogging  Easy Word Count can provide you with an accurate tally  If you re targeting your efforts at the wrong audience  or even at no specific audience  you ll be working harder than necessary and have very little results to show for it   Putting forward only half an effort  Either fully commit or just don t even bother   that s pretty much the plain and simple fact of entrepreneurship  It s going to take your full devotion for a successful launch and continued growth  so if you aren t ready to put in that effort  it will only be a waste of your time  Of course  there are resources  services and tools to make things easier for you  Just because you have to work hard  doesn t mean you shouldn t work smart  Assignment help can answer any of your writing related questions  so you re not giving your audience messy  error filled content to read  If you re going to do the work and create content for your readers  ensure you re putting out the best quality content possible   Going down the beaten path  Yes  there are a number of companies who offer the same products or services as one another  but the trailblazers of those industries are almost always the most successful  You should not be aiming to copy someone else s idea and trying to replicate their success  Instead  blaze a trail for yourself by solving a problem that has yet to be addressed  A quick scan through Academized s plagiarism checker can see if your thoughts are completely original  and if you do need to use some outside sources to lend some credibility to your content  Cite It In can compose perfect citations for you to use   Fighting change  Almost any business and industry is susceptible to changes   whether big or small  They re bound to happen over time  so you ve got to be ready and willing to roll with those changes  When you re too stuck on a certain plan  you could be steering your business away from the path of success because stubbornness is holding you back from accepting change  Have a business plan created  but don t set it in stone   Gloria Kopp is a web content writer and an elearning consultant from Manville City  She graduated from

1398,training-dataset/business/657.txt,business,How We re Striving to Make Buffer More Accessible and Why it MattersHave you ever had a moment that completely changed how you thought about the world around you   I grew up on the internet  It s a big part of my life pretty much every day  I ve learned how to program  changed careers  built community  and even met my boyfriend  Being online helps me travel the world with confidence  stay in touch with family  expand my empathy  and learn more about social justice issues   I have a hard time imagining where I would be if I didn t have access to the online communities and resources that have helped me get where I am today   I came to this realization last May  at a Global Accessibility Awareness Day event   I also learned that the way a lot of web based tools currently are currently built excludes a very significant portion of the population from enriching their lives through the internet the same way that I do   This realization had a huge  sobering impact on how I view my work as a developer at Buffer  changing how I write code and how I view new features  Since then  I ve been studying up on accessibility guidelines  connecting with others in the accessibility community  talking to users with disabilities  and pushing to make the web more accessible everywhere I can   even speaking about accessibility at JSConf in Colombia   Accessibility can seem like a complicated topic  but with just a few simple guidelines  we can have a huge impact on the experience of so many users  Here is what I ve learned so far in my journey  why building inclusive websites is so important for businesses of all sizes  and a few resources that can help anyone get started creating more accessibility   What does  accessibility  mean   Accessibility is the practice of designing and developing web sites and web content that provides a great experience for all web users   An accessible website is an inclusive website  At Buffer  making our tools  and culture   more inclusive fits in perfectly with our value   Do the right thing    I first thought that accessibility just meant making a website usable for blind users on screen readers  but a wide array of people need special considerations in order to use the web   This can include people with low vision  dyslexia  impaired motor function  hearing loss  color blindness  autism  as well as the elderly and people with temporary injuries such as injuries to the hand or arm   Implementing accessible features can look like   Making sure that a screen reader tool can navigate throughout your website  Making sure that information is not conveyed through colored icons or graphics that might be hard to decipher for those with color blindness  Making sure all audio and video has a transcript and or captions  so that blind users and deaf users can access it    And much more   Accessible websites  It s just good for business  When talking about accessibility  we often focus on the human or moral impact of building tools for everyone   which is definitely important  but an accessible website can also affect the bottom line of your business   Around 7 10  of people in the US have some disability that requires them to have an accessible website  That s a pretty big chunk of potential customers that could be prevented from using a site if it s not built with the proper accessibility considerations   At Buffer   I like to think about it this way  if we had a bug on our website that prevented 7 10  of our users from scheduling a post  how would we handle that situation   It would be a red alert for our team  Engineers would be all hands on deck to fix up the issue for our customers   We should view accessibility issues in the same way  Some accessibility issues can be so severe that they can completely prevent users from accessing the core functionality of a website   Another reason why making your website accessible is important is because in many countries  it s the law   In the U S  several large organizations have been sued for discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act  While most of these lawsuits are against public organizations like universities or government offices  the NBA  Toys R Us  Bank of America  Reebok and several other private organizations have also been sued for having inaccessible websites   Accessible features are beneficial for everyone  One of the most exciting benefits of focusing on accessibility is that designing and building for disability often creates results that are beneficial to everyone   Did you know that the concept of text messaging was first introduced via Telecommunication Devices for the Deaf  TDDs  which were designed to give deaf users a way to communicate via text over a telephone line   What if we could design and build websites that work for everyone  and by doing so   improve the quality of the product for all users   An example of this at Buffer is when we made sure that our composer was keyboard navigable for our users on screen readers  It meant that all users could also tab through the composing flow without having to use the mouse  This made it much easier for everyone to get through their workflow quickly   How we re working on accessibility at Buffer  At Buffer  we come to work every day excited to give people a greater voice on social media  it s part of our company s vision    Our tools enable users to run small businesses  express new ideas  connect around a common cause  and so much more   If I spend one hour making a component of Buffer a bit more accessible  it might help our users with a disability save 10 minutes of time online every day  When someone is using Buffer as part of their daily workflow  this time adds up and means more time that can otherwise be spent on their small business  quality time with family  or doing something they love   We know that we have a long way to go to make Buffer 100  accessible to all of our users  Our iOS app has been a beautiful inspiration for how to build a great app that works for everyone  and we re pushing to make Buffer com just as easy to use   We re doing that by making small changes over time that will eventually lead to a fully accessible experience  We started by auditing the site for accessibility traps  and making a list of all the things that need to be changed   One by one we are fixing these items  Talking with a Buffer user who uses a screen reader to schedule posts for her small business and hearing first hand how she uses Buffer helped us learn so much about the areas we need to improve  We are so grateful for users who take the time to write in or chat with us over the phone about accessibility at Buffer   Accessibility first steps  Start small  If you re just getting started with accessibility  it s easy to feel overwhelmed by the amount of work to be done   But making small accessibility wins happen once a week or once a month can still make a huge impact on your users  Start small and work from there   The best way to get started is by becoming familiar with some accessibility basics   Teach Access tutorial is a great resource  This tutorial will give you some background on accessibility as well as some practical ways to implement accessible features on your website   Another great resource is the A11Y Project which

1401,training-dataset/business/1249.txt,business,Life at a Booming Startup   Startup Grind   MediumI spent almost a year and a half working for one of my favorite startups  but I was totally unprepared   I was lucky enough to be a part of some amazing things at Product Hunt  met truly incredible people  grew up personally and professionally  and learned more than any other 16 month stretch in my life   It s the learnings that I feel most compelled to share  Some things that may be specific to me  but hopefully something that can be helpful to you   Totally Unprepared  I ve always heard internet wizards say that joining an early stage startup is the greatest learning experience anyone can get  behind failing  which is held in higher regard than the Rhodes Scholarship    But how do you prepare for such an incredible learning experience  You don t and I think that s the point   What I Thought  before I joined an early stage startup  I worked hard    I ve always been ambitious and had a solid work ethic  but I didn t really know what  hard work  was until I was working for something more than personal gain  Sure  it s a lot of hours  but everyone just seemed to work harder  more focused hours than I was used to  Some people  Ryan  even compete with robot level output   If I had a good idea  I could run with it    I ve since realized that I could ve been sitting on Facebook in 2004  Snapchat in 2011  or fire 400 000 years ago  and I probably would ve driven each one into the ground   There are millions of good ideas  but very few good companies  I d argue that a good idea is no more than 20  of the recipe for a good company  And a significant chunk of the remaining 80  can probably be taught  but I damn sure had never learned it    I knew how to prioritize    In this fast paced environment  what you want to focus on and what you should focus on are two entirely different things  A guaranteed way to fail faster is to just wing it  which was often my go to strategy in a pinch   When doing the job of ten with no real playbook and limitless options  decision making needs to be methodical  but not overly analytical  Time is your most valuable resource and to not take a little bit of it to prioritize for highest ROI would be to your detriment   I had good communication skills    Communication in a mostly remote team spread across 10  timezones is not the same as your typical forms of communication  Not to mention  the implicit cultural and linguistic barriers that comes with being dispersed remote  Slack has no sarcasm font  file names provide minimal context  and smiling on mute throughout an entire team video call gets a little weird   Efficient communication is an exponential time saver  Taking a minute to add additional information and context wherever possible will often save a handful of people a lot of time  And  again  time is money,"[1401 1145 51 609 1390 667 1316 362 1025 561 801]"
1410,training-dataset/business/315.txt,business,Should You Choose Entrepreneurship or a Corporate Career Entrepreneurship isn t for everyone  Even the most intelligent  hardworking  and resourceful founders often throw in the towel and return to the relative peace and safety of a corporate career   However  if you re at a point in your life in which you re trying to decide between the unpredictability of entrepreneurship or the stability of a corporate career  be sure to put considerable thought into each option as this is not a decision that should be taken lightly  To give you some food for thought  we ve syndicated a blog post from Arthur Gopak of AlphaGamma that outlines what influenced him to launch a company   The post   Why I chose entrepreneurship over a corporate career   originally appeared at AlphaGamma and has been republished with permission   No  I am not saying that having a corporate career sucks   Sure  I enjoyed my time working for some of the well known companies in the financial industry and business consulting   I learned a lot of practical skills to do the work I did  How to work with different types of people  How to handle workload and difficult people within organizations and their customers  But the feeling that I got stuck in a corporate environment  a  box   never left me alone  I felt being  just a number   This feeling magnifies when you know that you could do a better job than the management does   Most importantly  I have realized over time that a corporate career will not make me happy  I did not see myself working for a corporation  climbing the corporate ladder and hoping to reach the top by my 50s   I was following the show called  Bloomberg TechStars  and I was inspired to see my contemporaries coming up from nowhere  with no name and no title  and eventually killing it in the world of business  I wanted to be like that  And even before the show I knew I would become an entrepreneur one day   Yet  I needed more confidence  And the idea I would be really believe in to make this first step  Now the time has finally come   No  I am not urging everyone to jump start their own companies   Entrepreneurship is definitely not for everyone  I think that entrepreneurship is a mindset  Sure  you can learn a set of practical skills and acquire some knowledge how to do it  But it takes lots of personal traits and character to execute business ideas in challenging environments   Nevertheless  having some work experience first would definitely help  and you will barely find well known and successful entrepreneurs who started their companies without working for someone  For example  the Shark Tank investors Kevin O Leary worked in an ice cream shop where he got fired  Barbara Corcoran used to work as a teacher after graduating from college  And Mark Cuban worked as a bartender at an age of 25  Although they stayed at those jobs for a relatively short period of time  they made it clear to themselves to pursue their dreams as entrepreneurs   So some work experience  never killed nobody   but if you want to become an entrepreneur  the question is to be mentally prepared once the time is right   AlphaGamma is the place where millennials look for information  innovation and inspiration in the fields of entrepreneurship  business  and finance  Click here for more information    Business woman looking at road with maze and solution concept image by Shutterstock,"[1410 1316 1145 456 609 130 124 1396 1266 1390 185]"
1413,training-dataset/product/1470.txt,product,For product owners  managers or anyone who wants to build great The most important thing to understand is  to interact with a product  there are different kind of loads associated and not all loads are equal   To understand this we will have to first understand what a load is  And what are the different types of load    Imagine you are trying to book a flight ticket from point A to B on a website  You check the available flights and think about the suitable dates and time for you  what time suits you and maybe  the airline brand  You may also think about your budget  Then after considering all factors  you choose the flight  After this you check credit card balance and see if it has sufficient balance  so that you can proceed to pay  Then you click some buttons  and finally make the payment  This whole process involves  a  Things that you are thinking while interacting  Cognitive load  b  Things you are looking at on the screen  Visual load  c  Buttons you are pressing  mouse moments  taps etc  Motor Load  While interacting with product interface  any kind of an effort is a load and as I said earlier  not all loads are equal   Most to least expensive   Cognitive   Visual   Motor   It means it takes more effort for our brain to process cognitive tasks  than any other tasks   A study was done by Susan Weinschenk where the users had to go through more than 10 clicks in order to complete an action  On completing the task the users looked up smiling and said   That was easy    Reason   Each step was logical and gave them what they needed to see  There was no confusion  no clutter  They did not have to think before performing those actions   Daniel Kahneman  in his book  Thinking Fast and Slow explains two different ways the brain forms thoughts   System 1  Fast  automatic  frequent  emotional  stereotypic  subconscious  Fast  automatic  frequent  emotional  stereotypic  subconscious System 2  Slow  effortful  infrequent  logical  calculating  conscious  It is system 1 that forms decisions  and that system is emotional  subconscious  relies on nature and intuition   When we make people think  by clutter or not placing the proper information or steps  we make them switch to System 2 and as written above  system two is slow  conscious  creates friction and people give up on your products   What s the solution then   Trade offs   We should always try to minimize cognitive load  as it makes people think and breaks the seamless flow   The trick here is to make the users not think   If there is a step that makes them think  replace cognitive load by a lesser expensive load  motor load or visual load     Example   On a website s home page  you can have in detail what you do and all your services and products  That will increase visual load and clutter  Users won t also be able to understand your business because of overwhelming information and that will in turn increase the cognitive load   A better idea would be having an image in the background or a running video on homepage  that explains what the business does  This considerably reduces the cognitive load by adding visual element   Also having a little text and a simple primary call to action makes users understand what action to take  Removing distractions also reduces cognitive load  Users now have one action to take on a screen  and thus no confusion or load   Progressive disclosure is one other way that helps you reduce cognitive load  In this method  you only provide information people need at that moment  When people hover or click on the items  they get a little more detail about the thing that they want to know   This way people are not overwhelmed by too much information and can navigate effortlessly to the section that they want to explore  People in this case are not thinking now  Also  they are not getting confused or irritated because of too much information   So what we achieved here is a little more motor load  additional click   but lesser cognitive load  which is expensive   So  this is the tradeoff we did to achieve simpler and easy to use interfaces   To use progressive disclosure  an important point to remember is that  you should understand your users and you should also know what they want at each step  If you structure information in such a way that they are not able to figure out  navigating to which section will show them the thing that they are looking for  then the whole purpose of doing this is lost,"[1413 852 154 982 1280 836 1152 561 537 1298 1204]"
