10,training-dataset/product/1208.txt,product,Think of customer support as an investment  not a costThere s no escaping the fact that supporting your customers costs money  but how much money can you afford to spend while optimizing for growth and retention   Many companies respond to growth pressures by cutting the amount they spend on support  letting their customers  experience suffer as a result  Reducing your spend on customer support might look tempting in the short term  but will erode your profitability in the long run   unhappy customers will simply leave   At Intercom  we ve found customers who talk to support are worth 2 5 times more to us in MRR than the ones who don t  That s why we ve put even more emphasis on growing our support team   both in headcount  and tools for support  such as improved processes and training   Determining how much to invest in your support can be hard  It depends on your own financials  the stage of your company  the type of product you sell  etc  At Intercom  I ve been responsible for marketing Educate  our knowledge base product  so I ve been thinking a lot about how and why people invest in support  Coming from the world of SaaS finance  where part of my job was creating operating plans to grow the business  I believe the best way you can answer these questions is with a calculator  Once you ve defined some factors about your business  you ll be able to clearly understand how much your company should spend to support your customers   Calculating how much to spend on your customers  Start by determining each of these five elements per average customer   Acquisition cost  Money spent on sales and marketing to acquire a customer  e g  paid content  advertising  conference sponsorships  etc  This is usually the biggest expense and makes up about 25 35  of Customer Lifetime Value   Money spent on sales and marketing to acquire a customer  e g  paid content  advertising  conference sponsorships  etc  This is usually the biggest expense and makes up about 25 35  of Customer Lifetime Value  Activation cost  Money spent on setting customers up for success  e g  onboarding new customers  product education  etc   Money spent on setting customers up for success  e g  onboarding new customers  product education  etc  Retention cost  Money spent on avoiding customer churn  e g  knowledge base upkeep  staffing  systems and technology  etc  This is referred to in some circles as the missing SaaS metric   Money spent on avoiding customer churn  e g  knowledge base upkeep  staffing  systems and technology  etc  This is referred to in some circles as the missing SaaS metric  Annual recurring revenue  Money a customer pays in one year   Money a customer pays in one year  Expansion referral revenue  Any additional money a customer pays over and above their initial monthly spend  or how much additional money is collected without acquisition costs  e g  they tell a friend  or move to a new company and implement your product there too    Once you ve estimated these factors you can calculate how much money you should spend supporting each customer to reach your breakeven point and your return on investment for acquiring customers   Here are the simple formulas   Breakeven per customer support spend    Annual Recurring Revenue   Expansion Revenue   Referral Revenue     Acquisition Cost   Activation Costs   Retention Costs   and  Lifetime Value   Customer Acquisition Cost Ratio    Annual Recurring Revenue   Expansion Revenue    Customer Acquisition Cost  Actionable insights  This spreadsheet will automatically calculate your breakeven customer support spend and LTV CAC ratio,"[10 1389 1247 1043 328 126 881 756 1164 1014 1058]"
13,training-dataset/product/523.txt,product,What Should You Do When Your Product is Launched  Read This to Find Out Launching a product is an important milestone for any startup  but it should not be the end goal  Once a company s offering has been released to the public  the work doesn t  and shouldn t  end there  However  in this syndicated blog post  Greg Davis of Intercom offers his advice on what founders should do to get the most out of their recently launched product  and how it can put their company on the path to success   The blog post   Your Product is Launched  Now What    originally appeared on Inside Intercom and has been republished below with permission   If you work in marketing you know the drill  As your launch day comes to a close  it s natural to pat each other on the back and wipe your hands clean as you head home  The hard part s over  You launched   The reality is you aren t done  The launch is the start of the marketing journey  not the end goal  You now begin a cycle of listening  learning  iterating and shipping improvements based on real customer feedback instead of assumptions   What Happens After the Spike   Part of my perspective on launches comes from how we break down the role of the marketing team at Intercom  Our team has four core responsibilities that all contribute to different stages of the marketing sales funnel  The product launch touches on the first three of them   Reach  get our messaging in front of the right audience  Attract  get that audience to visit our site and become leads  Convert  convince leads to signup and become customers  Educate  help customers get increasing value and love our product  Launches produce spikes in traffic that look great from a  reach  and  attract  perspective  but when you dig further down the funnel and things often look less rosy  The reality is  product launches aren t highly targeted  They generate record traffic days  but the bulk of that traffic comes from people who don t end up buying  Here s a peek at traffic generated by the public beta launch of Acquire  our live chat product to communicate with visitors to your website  It resulted in a record traffic day  but this returned to normal levels fairly quickly   At Intercom  we aim to measure the success of our product marketing across every stage of the funnel  If an increase in traffic doesn t translate to an increase in conversions  new signups  upgrades or cross sells   then our launch hasn t been successful  and we need to understand why   A product launch gives you a vast data set from which to learn  iterate  test and fix your messaging across the entire customer lifecycle  from announcement email to landing page to onboarding flow and shopping cart  We consistently find that the small changes we do after launch drive more product adoption than the launch itself   The Post Launch Feedback Loop  After the launch  product marketing s job is to identify confusion or issues that might prevent people from buying the product   1  Listen to the Unfiltered Response  Before the launch  you have a set of assumptions about who you re selling to and why it matters to them  After launch  that picture becomes clearer  The launch turns on a firehose of qualitative and quantitative feedback and  as hard as it is  your job is to listen to it all without reacting  we ll get there in step 2   After all you might find that the biggest issues aren t with the product itself  but with everything surrounding it   Here are some ways we collect qualitative feedback   For feedback that comes in through Intercom  our sales and support teams loop us in  We sit in on sales calls to hear followup questions asked after a demo  We monitor social media mentions  Here are some ways we collect quantitative feedback   We look at Google Analytics  We collect click through and scroll data with Inspectlet  We also work with our research team to conduct user tests of the page  It s incumbent upon you to collect as many opinions as possible from both inside and outside our company  At this stage of the process  any and all opinions are valid  so shoot for breadth  In the next step we ll start to categorize data points and prioritize follow up action items   2  Make Sense of the Feedback  Once you ve gathered post launch feedback  how do you organize it all  I like to start by grouping feedback into two broad categories  pricing  or  messaging   and continue to get more specific as sub themes emerge   Consistent customer support issues  this includes bugs  setup issues  integration issues   Landing page engagement statistics  this includes the number of people clicking your CTA  understanding what your product does  scrolling all the way to the end  and generally engaging with everything you worked to put on your landing page   Pricing confusion  this might come through feedback that your pricing is too high  complicated  or unjustifiable  Others might ask for a free trial   Conversion issues  are people signing up but not installing  Canceling after the free trial  All of this should be documented and grouped in a bucket   Customer churn  for canceled accounts  document the characteristics of canceled accounts  Patterns will likely emerge  For instance  if everyone churning is a 3 person startup and your product is aimed at enterprises  maybe you re targeting the wrong audience   As you may have noticed by now  often what you learn post launch is outside the traditional realm of product marketing  We believe product marketing isn t just messaging  it s part of a system of how a product is received and consumed at every stage of the sales and marketing funnel   3  Ship Continuously  Like we do in software  in product marketing we ship improvements to our messaging continuously  Iterating towards the right solution prevents you from spending time and resources effectively re launching your product   For example  for the launch of Acquire we offered a free trial to new users but overlooked the ability to offer one for existing customers  simply because we hadn t done this in the past  We quickly received lots of feedback about this and recently began offering existing customers a free trial   Another smaller change we made was a result of broad confusion regarding the name  Upon visiting the Acquire landing page  users didn t immediately know who the product was for or what it did  Rather than do something drastic and time consuming  like change the name of the product  we added a more descriptive header to make it more obvious   The change is subtle  but we started seeing fewer confused customers  These iterations aren t always as glamorous or sexy as the product launch  but they move us in the right direction  Also  just because we have identified a problem and made a change doesn t mean you ll get the result you hoped for  After you publish a change  you go back to step 1 and start listening again to see if you are on the right path   Small Thoughtful Steps  It s natural to focus on a launch date and there s a huge effort to coordinate efforts between your product  support and marketing teams to have everything in place for the big day  But as a marketer it s a mistake to take your foot off the pedal when you get the product or feature into the hands of customers   The product marketing journey begins when you launch  Crafting the perfect message  pricing  user experience  and more  continues with small thoughtful steps throughout the life of the product  It s tempting to chase after the next shiny product launch  but it s important to keep iterating on what s already out in the world  You never get it right the first time    New Product Promotion Marketing Target Concept image by

product magnificent  superb  undeniably great  and profitable   By Phyllis Nikolaou  If you are into tech startups  you probably love Google  Apple  and PayPal  Yet  have you ever wondered why you feel so passionately about these companies  The answer is simple  novel ventures turn into awe inspiring brands thanks to useful  fascinating  and cutting edge products   that change the way we work and lead our lives   Right about now  you may catch yourself thinking  Yes  I know that already   Point taken  There is absolutely nothing new to this particular piece of information  Just one catch  a great product is required to enter the highway to growth and success  yet most founders tend to overlook it and focus more on the great investment hunt   Ultimately  creating an awesome product should be the most important part of your entrepreneurial journey  And  yes  it takes quite some time to get it right  In fact  it involves pretty much every form of intelligence and skill known to man  patience to get you through the initial trial and error stages  devotion to get users on board  dedication to develop your product further  and passion to stay on top of the market game   To make sure you don t get lost in translation  we present you with a quick and clean guide to building a game changing product  Are you ready to find out what it takes    1  Know your Market   Leave the Thrill of a Big Short Behind  In the common mind  entrepreneurs are usually considered  the crazy ones  the misfits  the troublemakers   We love Steve Jobs for these beautiful words that  in our mind at least  could not describe Richard Branson any better  yet we feel a clarification is in order   We are sure that if you look deep inside yourself  you will find a glimmer of madness  enjoy it  this is what makes you special  Entrepreneurship  though  does not mean you should open sail to the unknown and start taking huge risks every day   quite the contrary  A crazy initial idea is where it all starts from  still building a business is actually about learning to reduce uncertainty  So before you decide to throw yourself and your product deep into startup waters  take your time to think  research  and evaluate  In other words  get to know your market   How is your product different from what already exists out there  How big is the opportunity for your product in its target market  Is the timing right for you to launch it  Observe the trends  the customer types  the latest technology  and estimate the limitations the market itself poses on your product   Most importantly  talk to your potential users and customers   Be bold and ready to step out from your comfort zone   as Charalampos Kassios  Metavallon Expert advises   Who do you think these are exactly  Where can you find them  Learn what they value and what would make your product absolutely irresistible to them  Understand what they love and what they fear   the two most powerful forces that will shape their behavior   If your research indicates that your product can and needs to be built  then make haste and start working on your prototype  the infamous Minimum Viable Product  And so begins an incredible ride   Pure architecture  also known as creating a prototype    2  Get your First Customer   Build Something That Counts  What is the difference between a great idea and an actual venture  Market validation and traction a k a  customers  And it is the early adopters and the feedback you get from them that can make or break your success   especially since you rely on bootstrapping and small investments to venture forth   So  yes  you absolutely need to build something  Because it is the surefire way to kick start your process of learning more about your product and start asking whether and why some of its features work  At this point  establishing your MVP is critical   What is an MVP  Let us describe it as a prototype with minimum features  because your time and money are limited  and just enough to get your startup engine going   Now minimum is neither minimal nor just any  It can even be a single feature  as long as it is the most essential and value adding one  i e  the one feature that is totally absent from the market and utterly craved for   Once this is built  it is time to start asking questions  Take your MVP in your hands and get out there  introduce it to potential customers  let them interact with it  get them to pay for it  got to have skin in the game    seek their feedback  and start optimizing it  Believe it or not  this is the easiest and fastest way to build a great product   And while you are out there  doing all the meeting and greeting  make sure to spend some time with your customers  get to know what they like about your product and what they do not  what features draw them in  what things drive them away  All this info will lead to a better version of your product  a version that will get your clients more engaged and keep ahead of the curve    3  Prove Your Product Fits   Invest in A Concept that Works  Somewhere along your way to global domination  you will find yourself in the middle of a Cinderella like story  Okay  not in the middle   more towards the end of it  Except unlike the famous fairytale heroine  you will not get to try on a diamond shoe to see if it fits  you wish    Instead  you will be called to fit your product to the market  the world   The startup Cinderella story  product market fit  Now  if you have been working on your product for quite some time  we are pretty sure you think it is worth the time and effort  The real question though is  Is it worth the investment   Unlike your gut feeling  a proof of concept addresses how your product will support actual business goals  And as you may understand  getting that right is a major step along your business journey and something you  and all founders out there  should swear by   This documented evidence will confirm if your potential product can be successful and help you assess potential threats that might interfere with your company s growth  Even more it a great way to grow stronger  How  Metavallon Expert Benno Groosman explains  At this point you get to identify the challenges and plan accordingly  Embrace your failures and learn from them     4  Make Your Product 10 Times Better   Shake Things Up  So you have proven your concept and it is time to start developing your product  This is a happy place to be in startup life  yet it involves a lot of grit and hard work   Product development is all about making your brainchild better  more innovative  and more competitive  This involves a lot of testing and decision making  Do you need to add new features  Is your product in need of a user interface lift  Do you have to formulate an entirely new product for a niche market   At this stage  it is your vision  your team  your strategy  and your experience that will get you through the tough decisions and the compromises that you will have to make   There is just one guiding rule for your product   and your business for that matter  do things x10 better  Do not just offer something incrementally superior  To create an irresistible  force of nature product it needs to be x10 faster  stronger  more effective in what truly matters for your users and customers   In our instant gratification and product overflowing world  only x10 will grab attention and  equally importantly  will maintain it    5  Seize the Value   Get that Price Right  We are sure that you have heard how behind every great man  there is a great woman  The startup analogy of this legendary saying goes a bit like this  behind every business success story  there is the right pricing   So how can you get your numbers right  Throw in the mix a dash of good old marketing strategy to help you recognize your target and your positioning in the startup world  Then use the right marketing blend to map out your promotional tactics  To that  instead of the old economy cost based ingredient  add the value you are creating and your customer is willing to pay  an account of where your market and your competition is headed  and an estimation of your target revenue   Can you get your numbers right   At this point  it is also crucial to  explore all possible Revenue Streams  so that your business model can become feasible under various circumstances   states our friend and valued Expert  Alexis Komselis  All this should lead you to the perfect number  Yes  we mean the right price tag for your product   Also beware of the pitfall of being shy with pricing  It is rather glamorous to be going for users rather than profit  Revenue at the early stages is neither evil nor a growth slayer  It is simply  difficult   This is the invisible reason why so many first time venturers avoid it   the same way as they eventually avoid success  Indeed  there are many thriving startups that have taken the user route  there are even more  though  that have not   All in all  pricing is one of the most strategic issues you will come across in your journey as an entrepreneur  Getting the right value on your product can catapult you to growth and prosperity  Getting it wrong can be your Titanic   we are warning you now to watch out for this iceberg   And finally  the code to making your product magnificent  superb  undeniable great is finally cracked  founder   we hope you make magic happen   Originally published at  www metavallon org,"[23 1134 1142 494 365 80 1215 378 916 126 888]"
27,training-dataset/product/558.txt,product,The Importance of Listening to Your Customers by David Cancel56 Flares 56 Flares    Drift founder and CEO David Cancel spoke about the importance of listening to your customers at this year s London MTPCon  and gave us some apposite examples of what can happen when companies listen to their customers and when they don t  Listening to your customers is  one of things we always talk about but few people do  It s simple but never easy   he said   Why do we need to listen   Cancel gave the example of chip cards to illustrate why we need to listen to customers  While they are commonplace in the UK  EMV cards  as they re known  have only been rolled out in the US over the last year  They were marketed to US consumers on the promise of security  but to quote business news outlet Quartz   The US s transition to chip cards has been an utter disaster  They re confusing to use  painstakingly slow  less secure than the alternatives  and aren t even the best solution for consumers   What went wrong  says Cancel  is that the businesses involved   banks  credit card companies and retailers  weren t listening to their customers  They thought that they knew the job to be done  and that people wanted a secure card reader  But what people wanted was speed  not security  and they wanted security to be someone else s problem  The companies  solution had been decided behind closed doors  but if they had been listening to their customers  they would have realized that the 10 second processing time was a deal breaker   What about Henry Ford   There is a quotation  supposedly from Henry Ford  which is always trotted out to counter this argument  says Cancel    If I had asked people what they wanted  they would have asked for faster horses   He points that while in 1921 Ford sold more than 60  of all cars manufactured in the US  by 1927 that figure had dropped to 15   This was because  says Cancel  Ford had concentrated on producing a single inexpensive mass produced car  the Model T  and had failed to listen to and meet the changing needs of his customers  In doing this Ford opened the door to competitors like GM  who started to make cars for  every purse and purpose    In 2003 Lego lost  300 million   even though Lego has the highest profit margin of any toy brand   and predicted a loss of  400 million in 2004  In the 1980s and 1990s Lego had decided to innovate  but had innovated too much  It had replaced its veteran designers replaced with a younger crew who decided that customers wanted more choice  The number of unique Lego parts went up from 6 000 to 12 000  the designs became more complex and sales plummeted   Finally Lego asked its customers what they wanted  and it was told that its customers simply wanted to build  Lego s direction had shifted away building and creativity  but this was what people had loved about it in the first place  In 2004 Lego s new CEO Jorgen Vig Knudstorp stated that customers would have a say in all new Lego designs going forward  In 2010 Lego was profitable with sales of  2 3 billion  and in 2015 sales were  5 2 billion   This is why it s important to listen to customers   says Cancel   No excuses  Today there is no excuse not to be listening to customers  says Cancel   My approach  for the last decade at least  has been to shift away from waterfall and agile methodologies and say we now build software that is connected to our customers   Why would you build a product in an internet connected world and not lean into the advantages of that ecosystem  he asks  He points out that with the rise of messaging software customers can easily give you one to one feedback in real time   But how do you know what to do with the customer feedback you get  Cancel says he commonly hears the complaint that there is too much customer feedback  and too much noise  making it hard to prioritise and translate feedback into action  He has a framework to help   The Spotlight Framework  Customer feedback falls into one of three categories  says Cancel    User experience issues  These are questions like  how do I     what happens when     I tried to    Cancel says that PMs and engineers have a tendency to ignore this part of the feedback when they see it  For example a  how do I  question means that the customer already knows that something is possible with your product  so it s not a product marketing or education issue  it s a user experience issue   Product marketing issues  These are questions like  can you     How do you compare to    how are you different from   says Cancel   and they mean that you may have failed somewhere in the education process and they point to a product marketing issue  Otherwise why don t customers know this already   Positioning issues  These are especially important in developing a product  They are questions and statements like  I m probably not your target customer   or  I m sure I m wrong but I thought   If you think that they are your target customers  then statements like these immediately point to an issue which needs to be resolved   Focus on the right part of feedback  Cancel adds that people tend to focus on the wrong part of customer feedback  When customers ask  how do I do X   they focus on the X rather than the  how do I   He advises not to focus on subject of the feedback but on the root cause   He says that his framework is simple to implement and enables product teams to track how the feedback categories change month over month  The framework allows product teams to identify the top user experience  product marketing or positioning issues and ensure that they are crafting solutions that address the root causes of the issues at hand   Innovation is not just about sweeping changes  People value the small updates and fixes and that they were involved in that journey  You build goodwill because you re taking action   he says   In summary he says   In today s world  helping is the new selling and customer experience is the new marketing  Companies that fail to adapt   and that fail to listen to and communicate with their customers   will inevitably lose out  Keep your ears open,"[27 365 494 502 888 328 431 608 549 13 126]"
32,training-dataset/product/892.txt,product,Lessons in product management with Intercom s Colin Bentley and Brian DonohueWhen Colin Bentley and Brian Donohue joined Intercom as product managers  we were a company of less than 30 shipping product to a few thousand users  Jump three plus years forward to today  and we ve more than 300 team members  17 000 customers and 100 000 monthly active users  Meanwhile  Colin and Brian are now group product managers  who have been instrumental in shaping everything from our Platform and Messenger to our full suite of products  Engage  Educate and Resolve   In my chat with Colin and Brian  we reflect on what s changed in product management during their journey  what has and hasn t gone to plan  how they ve managed to stay close to customers while rising up the management ranks  learning to work with marketing  and much more  If you like what you hear check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the interview  but if you re short on time  here are five key takeaways  One of the biggest challenges at scale for a PM is maintaining a connection to customers  You ll get more and more user reports and research studies  and must avoid overemphasizing second hand feedback  Any PM will be enthusiastic to share what features are coming down the line  but it s a temptation you must learn to resist  You won t actually know if your solution solves a user s problem until it s released  Scope is a major challenge  particularly as you scale  Find the smallest definition of your idea  get it into your customers  hands and learn from it  There s no such thing as a successful product without users  and that s where marketing comes in  Scope a product down  but be weary of removing features that are part of your product s core marketing story  Brian and Colin are both strong advocates of the 6 week product development cycle  Why  It couples low effort planning with realistic expectations and full team buy in  Des Traynor  Today I m joined by Colin Bentley and Brian Donohue  two of our group product managers  Can you each explain what you do at Intercom  Colin Bentley  I look after two main areas of Intercom  First the Engage product  which is all about messaging customers   from one to one messaging right up to full newsletters you re sending to thousands of people  I ve also recently taken over our free product  which is primarily about the users you have inside your customer base and also looks after some of the more horizontal parts of the application  such as settings  navigations  etc  Brian Donohue  I m the group PM for our support products  One is Educate  which is our product for helping customers help themselves and actually just launched in December   it s been really fun to work on a product in its infancy  The other is Resolve  which is our help desk  It s been exciting to work on that recently because we ve really doubled down on that product over the past few months  Prior to that  I spent a lot of my time working on the Messenger  so that s where my headspace had been for a while  The evolution of product management at scale Des  You re some of the earliest hires   we were 20 30 people when you both joined  Today  we re more than 300 people  and we ve gone from hundreds of customers when you joined to 17 000  What s changed  Colin  This is an obvious answer but I feel like the biggest thing is the structure and the rigor that we apply to how we run the product development process  When you re unsure what stage any product is at and you re taking on different projects in lots of different ways  the amount that you have to hold in your head any one time is huge  By getting a common way the projects are run and knowing roughly where those projects are at allows you to shed a whole bunch of complexity in your head at one time  Everyone has this shared understanding that if something is at a single point in time or a certain phase  you don t need to explain anything else  because that context is there  Brian  Colin and I started close to the same time  and we actually collaborated very infrequently over the first couple of years because we were so independently focused on our parts of the product  That wasn t a good thing  Recently we have actually gotten to collaborate a lot more on process  You can t simultaneously be thinking strategically and executionally  but yet we actually asked that of ourselves  There s this constant melding of the two things and that s really hard to do  We ve gotten way better at that part of it  particularly recently     Don t stay on top of customer feedback and you can easily over emphasize requests you ve heard recently or frequently  The other thing is the scale of the feedback that you get  The number of customers that you impact is way different  Trying to stay on top of feedback feels like an impossible challenge  So that s something that we ve had to work at   how do you stay close to your customers  Particularly as a PM  you really want to feel you re tight with your customers and you really understand what their perspective is  You need to feel like you re at the coalface of your product  and the natural extension as you scale is you just drift further and further away from that coalface  Des  We have 100 000 monthly active users  That number was probably in the single thousands when you started  Say you want to change something in the inbox  which is like the core part of the Resolve product  Do you think   Oh my God  there s 100 000 people who use this thing every day for their job and I m about to move it   The challenge of scale is being able to keep some sort of connection with customers  Brian  I think it s actually the inverse  We were almost more sensitive to the change earlier because you re closer to it  where now it can be a little more abstracted  and that abstract is a risk  As the numbers go up  your brain just doesn t adjust to it well  It s 50 000  it s 100 000  it s a million  What s the difference really  It s just a huge number  Des  You get feedback in the form of user reports and research studies at this point  not individual users  Brian  That s true and that s also a risk if you just rely on that second hand feedback  The challenge of scale is being able to keep some sort of connection with customers  It s obviously going to be a small percentage  and that s where a lot of your conviction can come from  You have to watch the user studies  you have to talk to customers  you have to feel their pain  and that s where you get to make all the connections  If you re relying exclusively on reports then it s harder to actually get that conviction  Learning from past mistakes Des  As we ve added more structure  we potentially got more process and probably shoot ourselves in the foot less  What are some of the more epic ways in which things haven t gone to plan  Colin  There are a few skeletons in our closet  When you have a smaller team  you can tend to yo yo too much towards certain initiatives  So this month is all about fixing x  next month is all about fixing y  and the truth is probably somewhere in between  With a small team you tend to put a lot of resources one way or the other  For example  Project Awesome was an interesting experience where we felt the quality of our product wasn t up to scratch and we took a 2 3 month period where we buttoned down and just worked on quality  As a PM you should acutely feel the pain of saying no  Brian  One of the funnier screw ups I had  as PM on the Messenger team  was when I wrote a message for feedback in app and the message was   hey  I see you ve been using this feature recently  I just wanted to hear more about how you re using it and how well it s working for you   Our messenger had truncation  so it only showed the first few words of the message  Our customers saw this message with my face on it that said   I see you   and needless to say  that unsettled them a little bit  I had to tell Colin   We ve got to build that message preview for Engage   My first blog post for Intercom was about the demise of live chat and how it s all moving to messengers and messaging that can transition between real time and asynchronous  We knew we were fighting against the model of live chat that was in customer s heads  but even years later  we re still building product to deliver on that promise  I very much feel the pain of when we ve had to say no to continuing to build on that   Video is another example of something that we half built  We actually talked about it at one of our Inside Intercom events and got it released to beta customers and then we had to push it off the table  We brought it back on  then we had to push it off the table again  and all of this was because we just wanted to prioritize other things  As a PM you should acutely feel the pain of saying no  If it doesn t hurt to say no  then you re probably not doing something right  Those are two examples where saying no to those products really makes your stomach tighten  Des  There are also examples of the asymmetry between saying we re going to do something and actually getting it done  I was at a user conference for a popular enterprise public software company  valued about  4 6 billion dollars  They announced in 2015 the most fancy live editing  multi player collaboration  really cool stuff  They got a standing ovation at their conference from all their users who were like genuinely blown away by what was going to change their lives  and it was one of those products people use as part of their actual daily workflow  That stuff still hasn t shipped and that s despite seeing a beautiful demo  There is a real danger when you talk about something so long you almost cash in on all the reward except for you still haven t done the work yet  It s like telling your friends you re going to do a marathon and everyone s congratulating you  You ve got four fifths of the joy of doing the marathon already and you haven t set a foot in your shoes  Colin  The marathon is an interesting example in that in some ways when you re trying to really tackle an idea  that s the formulation of the thing that you re building  and yet you don t actually know if that s going to solve it until it s out in the world   almost after you ve told everyone  So you re committing yourself to actually doing it by telling your friends   I m in for the long haul   The short things that you build initially that you think might solve the problem turn out not to and you ve got 20 more miles to run  Brian  It s a human tendency to want to tell people about what s coming  Sometimes you can say it s deceptive  but it s actually very human to say   Look  we ve got more stuff coming  I know it s going to make you happy when you get this   You actually have to resist that temptation because it s so uncertain what you re going to build  when you re going to build it  Even when you re half way through engineering  you can still get stuck  Leaving your bias behind Des  You were both UX designers and consultants before becoming product managers at Intercom  Is that a good skill set to have coming in the door  Colin  Particularly in the frame of Intercom it was super helpful  Intercom has this very rich designer oriented DNA from its founders  Yourself and Eoghan come from that background and I found when I came in early  I was able to speak that language to intuitively know what was happening  That was just such a good head start to have  and if I m ever hiring a PM at Intercom  it s one real strength I ll look for  because I know that that s still how we primarily think about how we build product  Brian  There s so much you take for granted when you have a design background that s really helpful as a PM  The ability to do research  particularly if you don t have the luxury of a research team  well  efficiently and quickly is a huge advantage and problem definition  which we define very much as core to the PM role  is part of design  Any design thing starts with defining the problem  So we re explicitly merging design and product management there  which absolutely it helps a lot  The flip side is any PM comes with a bias from where their background is and you have to be aware of that bias and figure out where you re drawing that line  When Sketch was coming around and a lot of people were switching to it  I explicitly said   I m not learning Sketch   Part of this was laziness   I didn t want to learn a new tool   but part of it was I don t want the temptation to open up Sketch  I should just be writing on a whiteboard and taking a photo of it and sharing my idea that way  That s as far as a PM should be designing   Brian pictured in Intercom s Dublin office  We had a PM in the earlier days  Luke  who had a PhD in Computer Science  I remember being envious  because there were so many conversations he was able to be a part of to a much richer extent  and he said it hadn t helped him that much  He said   I can actually appreciate the elegance of a lot of the engineering solutions way better than you can  but that doesn t really matter   He has to pull back from his tendency of wanting to get in engineering conversations that aren t productive for him  Since that conversation  I ve never wished I had a deeper engineering understanding  A PM needs to understand the structure and how things are built and how they re working  but usually the strongest muscle on your team is the engineering muscle  You ve got an engineering manager  you ve got a handful of engineers  they ve pretty much got that one cornered  well cornered  All the other things are where the PM can bring perspective to the table and I think design captures a lot of those angles pretty well  Moving from product manager to manager Des  You ve both moved from managing products to managing people who manage products  How do you then decide where you can add value in the process and jump into the details versus when you should take your hands off the wheel and see what happens  Colin  There are two checkpoints that I focus on most specifically as to how I can add value as a Group Product Manager across a number of teams  The first one is the definition of the problem  We specifically write that before taking on any design work and we hone that problem  which is basically a one page description of what we re trying to solve and how we re going to measure the success of it  That will go through a good few iterations with the PM  with the team  to make sure we have it right  The second checkpoint where I try and add value is when we go a bit wider on the many possible solutions and then start to narrow in and decide what we re actually going to build  I ll really be thinking about the scope for the piece that we re first going to build   what s the smallest definition of the great idea that we ve had that we can get out into customers hands and prove that it s right or not right  And what do we need to learn from it   The idea of  starting with a cupcake  is metaphor for how product managers at Intercom approach scope  Brian  A huge challenge in any management role is how far involved to be or where to pull back  Having those milestones gives you the reassurance that you don t constantly need to be making sure you re not missing a critical meeting where it s the right chance to try to influence the product  You could also frame it to the team as  Hey  pull me in when it s useful to you to bring my perspective to it   It s actually earlier in the design concept stage where I ll be more involved  The short answer to this is it s really been tricky  There was one point where I was thinking I ll go in at the weekly planning meetings  tad the team says   Hey  you gotta back off from this  Stay out of this part of it   It s important one to be sensitive to and try to get right  and it s very much an ongoing thing to get that balance  Des  Similarly  as a person who manages Product Managers and also indirectly manages the products that serve customers  the other people you serve are the customers of your products  How has your relationship with them changed as you re no longer hands on with the product but still help Project Managers connect with customers  How do you connect with customers these days  Brian  We re trying to systematize this because you can easily go a month and think   Crap  I haven t talked to any customers this month  that is horrific   It s shocking how quickly that can just fade to the background  Colin and I have talked before about saying   Hey  you ve got to do a customer day once a month   so you re actually sitting down and working the help desk and talking to customers  You also need to talk to current customers and prospective customers  so we re trying to work a system with the sales team so they can actually bring everyone from the PM team into sales calls  Earlier this year the sales team organized ten customer sessions where you d go on site and that was fantastic and really intensive  It s hard to know  is it better to have an intensive customer immersion or to have it spread out  I have no idea which is better  but the intense part of it really sears more deeply into your brain at certain points  so sometimes that s really valuable  The default is that you just get more abstracted and you ve got to force yourself to occasionally be at that coalface  Des  I m tempted to picture the pointy haired boss from a Dilbert cartoon saying   I talked to four customers today so here s the thing we have to build   and you have to realize that you re collecting antidotes at that point  When we re dealing with the scale of hundreds of thousands of people  four conversations might not actually be that important  How do you dilute these conversations appropriately  Colin  You use your subconscious  A lot of how I think about those customer calls is just pushing more personality and stories  They ll connect with lots of the other things that are surfing around in the back of your head  and put a name and a face and an emotion and a feeling around those things that you felt you needed to do in the first place  but just didn t quite have the conviction or the sense of who that person was and the pain that they were feeling  Throw it in there  let it mix around and when you next see a big data point come up   bang  It s going to sync with it and you ve got both the evidence and the visceral feel to make this happen  Where product meets marketing Des  Something we absolutely did not have when you both joined was any concept of Marketing  How has your relationship grown with marketing  I m sure maybe you both started as cynical as the rest of us  Colin  Our VP of Product  Paul Adams  has a great quote along the lines of  If you build a great product and no one uses it  have you built a great product   That s rung true to me more and more as I ve worked at Intercom  What I find really helpful on the marketing side is the very external view of what s going on in the world  I can think very closely about my customers  the people who are using my product every day and what I see as important for them to build   and I m looking out in the market as well   but the marketing team bring a whole different angle on that  They think about the purchasing decision and the other competitors that I really hadn t considered in my mind  and between us we fuse that understanding of what are the most important things to build here that will satisfy our existing customers but also give us a new place and space in the market so we can talk about something different  There s a real naivete that product first actually means product only  Brian  As a company  was say we re product first  We say that internally repeatedly  There s a real naivete that says product first actually means product only  that all you need to do is build a great product and everything else will follow  That s just foolish  The best product people are naturally good marketers  and vice versa  They re not as separate as you initially think  In a company if they are very separate  that s a real problem  If when the product team looks on the marketing page and thinks   I don t really know if they get what we re building   that s a problem  I remember 18 months ago I went to our own landing page and thought  actually this is a really coherent framing of what we re offering  It was a real useful way to center where my brain was for something that I hadn t thought about for a while  That s a success when your marketing team can actually articulate things really well like that  That s useful for the product team  It s not just what you build  but it s how you frame what you build in your customer s heads  and if you ignore that  you re just bad at building products  If you think about the naming in your UI  that s not just about usability  that s marketing  That s how you re positioning what you ve just built in your customer s heads so that it s actually desirable and useful to them  Des  A really nice example of this is in Basecamp 3  where they have a tool called Work Can Wait  which is how you disable interruptions  You turn off notifications when you re not working basically  They could have called this  notifications preferences  or anything like that and it would have bored the shit out of the users  but still be understandable and doing its job  They actually took the opportunity to see these things as marketing opportunities  Basecamp has an opinion that work can wait and Asana or Trello doesn t have that opinion   they have notification preferences  which is a totally different thing  The marketing voice when we re labeling and discussing projects  even if just for internal use  is actually really important   Brian  It s something we re still trying to get better at  The Product Marketing Manager and the Product Manager  we ve tried to make that a really tight relationship  It s been hard because we re split between Dublin and San Francisco  but it s critical  Another example of where we re trying to get better at this is with our intermission  which is basically our problem statement  and we re actually included the Inter story  which is our own language for how we re going to pitch this  As part of this central document and trying to get that inter story written earlier up front to start framing this in people s heads  We re now explicitly saying   Hey  make sure you re really scoping down  scoping down  but if it s part of the story  that s legit  Don t break the story   We re explicitly getting the marketing into the scoping  which we previously were not very good at  The evolution of Intercom s product roadmap Des  Last year we worked towards what was called the 666 roadmap  where we planned 6 weeks  6 months  and 6 years ahead  We ve recently killed the idea of 6 months timeline  What went wrong there  Colin  There are two points that jump out to me when we talk about the 6 month aspect  One is that it became this uncomfortable mix of strategy in the things that we wanted to build over the medium term and then also around planning  which is like a promise to deliver something on a certain date  The 6 month had this really dangerous scenario of getting mixed up in that  Everyone external from the company would see that something s on the 6 month roadmap  and assume they can plan that roughly in 6 month s time we re going to have this thing  Yet often the product teams were using it as a means to just map out what looks like the next most important things for us to build  There was this mixed translation that was happening   The second problem was that we had a rolling scenario where essentially at any time anyone could open up a roadmap in the company and it was somewhat of an accurate representation of what we were working for in 6 months  That taken to intense degree means that you as a product manager have to come in and update that because guess what  it took a longer day yesterday  We never took it quite to that extreme  but because there s no defined points at when this thing gets updated  you either never update it or you never think of all the planning activities to make it accurate  Des  Brian  you ve been an advocate of the 6 week cycle  What do you like about 6 weeks  and how do you prioritize within that time frame,"[32 328 709 1026 1014 494 365 1121 549 222 126]"

57,training-dataset/business/1442.txt,business,Why Value Creation is the Foundation of BusinessValue Creation  Business begins with value creation  It is the purpose of the institution  to create and deliver value in an efficient enough way that it will generate profit after cost   Because value creation is the starting point for all businesses  successful or not  it s a fundamental concept to understand  Here s what is to come in this collection of wisdom about value creation   Definition of Value  and how it can be created  Evolution of value creation through history  and in the future  How value can be measured and managed  In the next Edition  we ll pair this with research on Value Capture   join Evergreen to be sure you get the followup to this post   How Value is Created  Value Defined   In the broadest terms possible  value is created through work  This work could be mechanical  cutting a tree down and turning it into lumber  or creative  creating a logo or writing a paper   Of course  not all work is value creating  sisyphysian tasks like moving rocks from one place to another  then back    The purpose of a business is to create value  through work   sell or trade it to customers  and capture some of that value as profit   Ok  Duh  yes  but we re starting from the bottom here    A Precise Definition of Value Creation  In his excellent book  The Origin of Wealth  graciously gifted to me by Nathan Bashaw   Eric Beinhocker offers a scientifically rigorous definition of the creation of economic value  based upon the work of the Economist Georgescu Roegen   A pattern of matter  energy  and or information has economic value if the following three conditions are jointly met   1  Irreversibility  All value creating economic transformations and transactions are thermodynamically irreversible   2  Entropy  All value creating economic transformations and transactions reduce entropy locally within the economic system  while increasing entropy globally   3  Fitness  All value creating economic transformations and transactions produce artifacts and or actions that are fit for human purposes   For those who didn t take a Thermodynamics course in college  myself included   substitute entropy for  disorder  for a decent approximation  So in more normal human words  Value is created through an irreversible process which gives a resource s  order  greater usefulness to other humans   Under this definition  almost any activity can be value producing  from opening a door for someone  to writing something  to turning the sun s energy into power to run your ceiling fan   Not All Value is Created Equal  As there are an enormous  and ever increasing  set of possible ways to create value  how do we decide which type to pursue  Is each way of creating value as useful to us as another   Peter Thiel doesn t think so  In his incredibly useful book  Zero to One  he talks about the conditions of a successful business  All businesses must create value  but some types of value  and methods of value creation  are more useful than others  His book is summarized in this talk at Stanford   Creating value by producing a commoditized product is not a pathway to success  Think about the substitutability of your product or service  Do customers have a wide array of other options  Do they have to make a purchase at all  Are you meaningfully distinct from your competitors   If your industry is in competitive equilibrium  the death of your business wouldn t matter to the world  some other undifferentiated competitor will always be ready to take your place   This is the condition for most businesses   what they sell is not unique  but generally substitutable  If you want to create the kind of value that builds a lasting and successful business  Thiel says you must be unique   All happy companies are different  each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem   To solve that unique problem  you must develop unique skills or processes   In the real world outside of economic theory  every business is successful exactly to the extent that it does something others cannot   This set of ideas is really to lead in to studying Competitive Advantage  the  how  of developing and delivering on this unique value proposition  What does your business do that others can t match   Thanks to Victor Sowers and Itamar Goldminz for recommending this set of Peter Thiel s ideas   Note  Delivering a commoditized product with a radically improved cost structure is certainly a Low Cost Competitive Advantage  and is a very worthwhile method of value creation   Value Creation Chain  through an Organization   For a visual way to consider value creation  let s take a look at Porter s Value Chain  The Harvard Business School Professor generalizes all business processes and shows each contributes to the organizations goal to create value for customers   These  Primary Activities  are the process alluded to in our first definition from Beinhocker  which do the  work  to create the value that customers are paying for   Inbound logistics   These are all the processes related to receiving  storing  and distributing inputs internally  Your supplier relationships are a key factor in creating value here   Operations   These are the transformation activities that change inputs into outputs that are sold to customers  Here  your operational systems create value   Outbound logistics   These activities deliver your product or service to your customer  These are things like collection  storage  and distribution systems  and they may be internal or external to your organization   Marketing and sales   These are the processes you use to persuade clients to purchase from you instead of your competitors  The benefits you offer  and how well you communicate them  are sources of value here   Service   These are the activities related to maintaining the value of your product or service to your customers  once it s been purchased   Any business will have some version of each of these activities  even if it s just a one person service company  This set of primary activities are the foundation for creating value as an organization   The Evolution of Value Creation  Historic Value Creation  This infographic from Funders and Founders summarizes the long history of a wide variety of human attempts at value creation  I don t consider it scientific or comprehensive  strictly speaking  I don t think plunder count as value creation   but it is a quick way to get a sense of the evolution of the economy up until today  To see the full story  go to the site here   Of course  there were lots of parallel types of value creation throughout history  these are just examples dominant in each era  Given where we ve come from  where are we going next   What Value Creation looks like in the Future  As we look at the changes in the way our economy has created value in the past 100 years  we ve shifted from a focus on huge mechanical production during the industrial revolution to more creative and customized production through the information age  Software and related services dominate more and more of value creation   This is a point raised by Jack Hughes in his piece in the Harvard Business Review  contributed by Victor Sowers  called What Value Creation Will Look Like in the Future   The value of products and services today is based more and more on creativity   the innovative ways that they take advantage of new materials  technologies  and processes  Value creation in the past was a function of economies of industrial scale  mass production and the high efficiency of repeatable tasks  Value creation in the future will be based on economies of creativity  mass customization and the high value of bringing a new product or service improvement to market  the ability to find a solution to a vexing customer problem  or  the way a new product or service is sold and delivered        We need to understand how to manage creativity as well as we do managing effort today  Productivity means we ve wrung cost out of our operations  Creativity means we created more value  we sold X units of something that didn t exist before  we increased the sales of Y not because we made it cheaper  but because we made it better or we increased our value to customers by servicing needs we hadn t serviced before   Because our economy is becoming more fluid  more individualistic  we need to open up our views on value and allow for the creative work to take it s place with other more mechanical forms of value creation   How Value Creation is Measured  So with value created in various ways   how can it be uniformly measured  Is it possible to create comparisons between value created in a variety of ways through different processes   Value Creation as Revenue  The most simplistic way to measure value creation is through Revenue  This measure ensures that the process of value undertaken wasn t worthless  if someone is willing to pay for it   Revenue is the measure of value creation   not profit  A company can create value without creating a profit  and many do  But they don t do it for long   Peter Thiel shows this in Zero to One   Even very big businesses can be bad businesses  For example  the US airline companies serve millions of customers and create hundreds of billions of dollars or value each year   Compare them to Google  which creates less value  but captures far more  Google brought in  50 Billion in 2012  versus  195 Billion Revenue for the airlines    Revenue is not the perfect measure of value creation   only the simplest  What Revenue really measures is a floor for value creation  The total value created cannot be LESS than the revenue it generated  Here s why   Exchange Value vs  Perceived Use Value  An academic paper contributed by Robert Hacker was instrumental for me in understanding this concept  Written by Bowman   Ambrosini  Value Creation Versus Value Capture has explored the possible methods of measurement of value and created important distinctions   If something is purchased  the customer perceives a consumer surplus  0  or they wouldn t make the exchange  So the total value created is the price paid  AND the perceived value of the consumer surplus  In graphic form   Here are the formal definitions   Perceived Use Value is subjective  it is defined by customers  based on their perceptions of the usefulness of the product on offer  Total monetary value is the amount the customer is prepared to pay for the product   Perceived Use Value is determined individually by each of us  and is subject to change at any time  Another measure of value is the exchange value   Exchange Value is realized when the product is sold  It is the amount paid by the buyer to the producer for the perceived use value   Revenue is a sufficient proxy for quickly evaluating value creation  but it isn t a complete measure   Further Reading on Corporate Value Measurement  If you re interested in reading more deeply on value creation  measurement  and management in larger organizations  two books recommended by Cecile Rayssiguier are a great place to start  Value based metrics  Foundation and Practice and Managing Customer Value   Open Questions about Value Creation  Is it possible to create profit without creating value  Probably  but I think that counts as a scam  At best  it s arbitrage   Any counterpoints here    How do we think about value that s created  but never monetized  Is that the creation of goodwill or karma   What about value that is created through meaningful effort and lost before a sale   spoilage of food  for example,"[57 970 704 888 881 1222 101 1253 427 544 1415]"

success of the product  Even if you ve adopted a lean approach  you ll find that the first impressions you set at launch will be hard to break   In my experience  successful product launches usually have the same few ingredients  the right timing  the right product  and the right customers   Below  I ve shared what I believe are the 6 most important elements of a successful product launch   1  Focus on a Single Buyer Persona  According to a CB Insights survey  42  of startups fail because of poor product market fit  Presumably  these startups had promising products but couldn t find a steady stream of customers for them   Poor product market fit can often be chalked up to ill defined buyer personas  Businesses often head straight to launch without knowing who their target customers are  On the other hand  they sometimes have too many personas which spreads their marketing focus thin and leads to failure   Neither of these situations is ideal  This is why at launch  you should focus on a single buyer persona at first  This should generally include your hungriest buyers who are easy to convert  Once you have a process for turning them into paying customers  you can expand your focus to cover other buyer personas   One way to approach this is to adopt a customer development methodology  courtesy of Steve Blank   With this approach  customer development and product development happens in tandem   As a result  once you re ready to launch  you already have a group of vetted   and paying   buyers  This takes the guesswork out of finding product market fit and primes you for a successful launch   2  Solve a Specific Problem  It can be tempting to launch a product that solves every problem imaginable for your target market  This Swiss army knife approach usually leads to half baked products  or worse   products not being launched at all   Conversely  some of the most successful products often started out solving very specific problems for a narrow market segment   Consider the case of Park io  This product solves a very specific problem   helping people backorder expired  io domain names  Instead of diversifying focus to multiple domain extensions  Park io covers just  io domains and earns revenue of  125k month   This tailored approach is proven to work across industries  Amazon didn t sell everything from A to Z when it launched  it only sold books  Microsoft didn t sell everything from cloud computing to operating systems  it only sold DOS   For your product launch to go right  it is crucial that it solves one problem really well at first  Later  you can expand your focus to other problems based on user feedback   3  Position Your Product Right  Positioning defines how you ll market your product against competitors  This is a very broad term that encompasses everything from your design and copywriting to your features and pricing  Whether customers see your product as serious  business like  fun  affordable  etc  will usually depend on your initial positioning   Positioning is critical for launch success  The impressions and expectations that you set at launch will linger for years  possibly even forever  If Coke s C2 or New Coke failed to find markets  it can be chalked up  in large part  to poor positioning   Your positioning should take the following into consideration   Buyer personas  Position your product to align with your target market s values  demographics  affordability  etc   Internal culture  An often overlooked point is that your internal culture should be able to support your product s positioning  Selling yourself as a youthful  fun product when you don t have a culture to support it can lead to disaster   Marketing capabilities  Closely tied to internal culture  your positioning should align with your existing marketing capabilities  If you want to push the product with clever  quirky marketing  you should have the right designers and copywriters to support it internally   Competitors  Positioning helps you stand out from your competitors  Detail exactly how your competitors market themselves  then pick a position that separates you from them  Your customers should know immediately what differentiates you from others on the market   4  Build Momentum with Pre Launch Marketing  Before Mint launched its personal finance app  it already had a pre beta waiting list of 20 000 people   Mint managed to do this through aggressive email collection tactics and content marketing  even before actual product launch   This serves as a lesson in launches  your marketing should be as much a focus as the actual product development  You should have some market buzz  press relationships  emails and content to kickstart distribution when your product goes live   This solves one of the biggest problems for most businesses  distribution  Instead of waiting on a  build it and they will come  approach  this gives you the momentum necessary to ensure success   How you build this momentum will depend on your own capabilities  but a few tactics you can try include   Email list building  At the very least  set up a landing page with an email collection form  Refer people to this page whenever and wherever you mention your product   Content creation  If you can  maintain a blog and promote your content aggressively  Add an opt in form to collect emails from visitors  This will give your brand some market recognition  an SEO footprint  and emails before the actual launch   PR  Start the PR process long before you launch the product  Nurture relationships with influencers and use content seeding to reach out to journalists  A Rolodex full of press contacts will be invaluable once you do launch   5  Iterative Approach to Development  Aaron Patzer  founder of Mint  had this to say about the process behind Mint s success    When I started Mint I took a very different approach and this is sort of the methodology that I formed  Validate your idea   Create a prototype   Build the right team   Raise funding     You might recognize this as the lean methodology later championed by Eric Reis   An iterative approach to product launches means that you continuously develop the product based on customer feedback  Instead of launching a finished product  your launch should do one thing exceptionally well  see  2 above   and then expand based on what users have to say   The iterative approach depends on user feedback  Consequently  here are a few things you can do in different stages to gather feedback   Pre beta stage  Interview prospective customers and or run surveys to understand user requirements and resistances   Beta stage  Email your users and ask for pointed feedback on their experience  Invite a select few for a chat or coffee  Alex Turnbull of Groove  for instance  emailed 500 early customers for feedback which helped improve the product   Post launch  Incorporate feedback collection tools and methodologies  such as Qualaroo widgets and NPS scores  Users should be able to tell you exactly what is wrong  or right  about your product so you can improve it in the future   6  The Right Timing  Timing is a tricky metric to quantize  You can define it as the answer to three questions   Is the market ready for my product  There should be verifiable demand for the product or at least a positive market sentiment  especially for consumer products    Is my product ready for the market  The product should be in a mature enough stage to bring real results to its buyers   Is my team ready to bring the product to market  Your team should have the expertise  motivation and know how to transition from  development  to  launch  stage   If the answer to any one of these questions is  no   it can impact your product launch   To know whether there is a demand for your product  you can   Interview prospective customers  Follow market surveys and trends  Launch a beta  or even alpha  version to gauge demand  Study new launches by competitors  The answer to the other two questions is highly subjective  of course  You ll have to ask your own team whether they  and the product  is ready to go live   Over to You  It usually requires several elements coming together to create a successful product launch  You need the right product  the right market  the right positioning and the right timing for success   These 6 elements are not always necessary for a successful launch  but they will definitely help in getting your product off the ground,"[80 13 1215 431 1134 23 365 494 1142 378 101]"
81,training-dataset/business/388.txt,business,The Shape of TractionWe do a fair bit of investing in companies pre product and spend a lot of time speaking with entrepreneurs before they have found strong product market fit   The tricky thing about the period before strong PMF is that it s rare that things are obviously not working  If you are a smart  competent team building quality products  usually you can squint to see some evidence that things are  sort of working  and believe that with a few more iterations or more scale  things will really start working  Essentially  there is the sense that strong PMF is just around the corner   It s been helpful for me to think of this period in terms of a graph  and to contemplate the shape of these curves  Imagine a graph with the X axis being  product quality  and the Y axis being  traction   There is some level of traction that suggests that it s highly likely that you have strong product market fit   The simplest visualization of this would be a straight line  The better the product  the better the traction  and the relationship would be linear  This is simple to visualize  but everyone knows it is not the reality   The more accurate visualization is probably an S curve  Initially  the improvements in a product yield positive results  but the return on product quality start to increase exponentially as you approach PMF  At some point  you get diminishing returns and the relationship starts to flatten  For the purposes of this post  let s just contemplate the first half of this curve before we really start seeing diminishing returns  It looks more like this   The challenge for entrepreneurs is interpreting the flattish part of the curve  That s the  kind of working  phase  Where is the kink in the curve for your product  Is it pretty close  which would mean that it s right around the corner  Is it actually pretty far  Or  even worse  is there not really a kink to be found and the curve you are on is actually different   Example 1  You think you are close to the kink  but are pretty far  Example 2  You think you are heading for an inflection point  but you are not  It s hard to have a crystal ball and really know where you are  and there isn t a one size fits all approach for all businesses  But I ve found that it s helpful for founders think about this framework and the assumptions they are making about where they are in the curve  From my experience  I ve noticed a few things that tend to be true   First  founders tend to over estimate how good a product needs to be before you start to see meaningful traction  Put differently  it s amazing how crappy or bare bones products or services are when they start to show meaningful adoption and wildly happy customers  Now  in competitive segments  there may be minimal level of quality required around look feel  speed  and polish  But when you think about the actual features and functionality  bare bones products that are doing unique things can get adoption very quickly   Second  founders tend of underestimate how well things work when they do start working  This is why it s easy to think that PMF is right around the corner  when it is in fact far away  Don t fool yourself into thinking that you have PMF when you don t  That s one advantage one might have if they have been at a company that has had very strong PMF  because you know what it looks like when it happens  The best discussion of this is in an old post from Marc Adreessen almost 10 years ago  The article is republished here  on LI of all places  https   www linkedin com pulse marc andreessen product market fit startups marc andreessen  The money line    You can always feel when product market fit isn t happening  The customers aren t quite getting value out of the product  word of mouth isn t spreading  usage isn t growing that fast  press reviews are kind of  blah   the sales cycle takes too long  and lots of deals never close   And you can always feel product market fit when it s happening  The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it   or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers  Money from customers is piling up in your company checking account  You re hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can    So  I find that the journey for find PMF often looks different than you think  Lesser products can create greater traction  and that traction is faster  Instead of this picture   It actually looks more like this   And because of that  the search for PMF may be challenging  but it s not usually constrained to one curve  It s more a series of bigger pivots or restarts that occur on different curves  until you find yourself on the right one  This is hard to illustrate unless you change the X axis a little  so instead of X being product quality  it is time  Each curve is a different attempt at PMF with a different product   So  for a pre PMF company  what I usually encourage founders to do is shrink the time required to figure out whether an experiment is working or not  Also  I encourage them to keep their teams small and their burn low during this period  Having a big team is great after PMF  but often lengthens this process before PMF  This influences both how much money they look to raise at this point  and how aggressively they should build their teams even if they have a lot of money in the bank  And if things aren t working  it s important to consider much more radical shifts of thinking and direction rather than incremental improvements   This post is already too long  but one final word  In this post  I m speaking specifically about companies that are searching for initial product market fit  The path towards building a great company after initial PMF can look very different  and this is not about that  Anyhow  I d be curious how this jives with the experience and observations of other founders and investors  This is just one view of the shape of traction  In my next post  I ll revisit this idea  but from the perspective of a question I often get   How much traction do I need to raise a round,"[81 1134 627 23 617 32 1215 1253

89,training-dataset/business/1004.txt,business,Why  Ops  Is Taking Over Startup LandA little over a year ago  I wrote that for startups  the Secret Weapon for Scaling was Sales Operations   Since my writing about the importance and value of Sales Operations  where there are now 11K job openings on LinkedIn for this role   I have observed with great interest the explosion of operations functions in every function in Startup Land  a less geographically biased way of referring to the world of startups than  Silicon Valley    Here are a few examples   Business Operations  One of my talented HBS students works for the finance department at Pinterest in a job titled  Business Operations   I have seen many of my portfolio companies create this role under the CFO as a complement to FP A  financial planning and analysis   Whereas the FP A function is typically responsible for instrumenting the financial metrics and reporting them  the Business Ops function has emerged as the group that interprets the strategic implications of the business metrics more broadly and then formulates and drives new initiatives cross functionally to address key issues  For example  how do you measure the success of a new product launch   and what do you do post launch about the results you do measure  Business Ops focuses on decisions  not just data  and then helps operationalize those decisions within a startup  A quick LinkedIn search shows 15K openings for Business Operations  15M title holders in the network  including companies like Circle  Lyft  NerdWallet and many others   Product Operations  One of my portfolio companies  DataXu  recently created and filled the position head of  Product Operations   a role that reports to the CTO who manages the entire 150  product and engineering team  That executive will be responsible for measuring the product development process and implementing the necessary changes to make it more effective  They are also charged with training new hires and managing vendors  In short  they are like a  COO  or  VP of Ops  on behalf of the product organization  DataXu is not alone in hiring for this role  A quick LinkedIn search shows 6K opening for Product Operations and 200K title holders  with executives holding this title at growth stage companies like Fuze  Sonos  Wayfair and many others   Marketing Operations  One of Flybridge s marketing advisors has been discussing with me the rise of this role  The Marketing Ops role has been created because of all the data coming out of marketing automation tools and other systems  Marketing Ops makes sure that the right leads are being transitioned to sales in the right way and that the sales reps are using the sales force automation systems properly and that they are integrated with the marketing automation systems  Marketing Ops might be the group that scores the leads  tracks them through the sales process and does the win loss post mortem analysis  Watching the data  making sure it is integrated across the organization  managing the marketing systems  and reporting cross functionally on key marketing metrics are all the jobs of the marketing ops function  Our portfolio company  MongoDB  has a nice job description for their open position   Director of Marketing Automation and Operations   that tells the story well  There are 5K openings on LinkedIn for this role and 9M people with that title in their profile   Why has Startup Land suddenly gone bonkers over Ops roles and embedding them within every function  I think the simple answer is Big Data and process maturity  As companies stabilize their business models and find product market fit  they begin to adjust from a hunch driven operating model  where decisions are made by the founders in large part on gut instinct  to a metrics driven model  where decisions are made by professional managers based on data  With the availability of so much data across all functions to professional managers  they need more analytical and operational horsepower to synthesize that data and derive insights from them that drive the business  Hence  the thirst for an operations staff analytical  mid level executives who can get into the weeds  derive insights and turns insights into action cross functionally   I have been preaching this message to all my portfolio companies  if you re a startup executive and haven t begun to operationalize your organization  you re at risk of falling behind,"[89 365 494 916 741 324 101 549 13 442 1036]"
101,training-dataset/business/1205.txt,business,How to Develop Strategic Messaging and PositioningThere are a few value messaging maps you can find online  There is no right or wrong framework  You should aim to find the one that fits your company purpose best or you can modify an existing one  I took a few ideas and created my own version of a value messaging map that fits SaaS companies with multiple target customers in the buying process   In my article on lead scoring and lead nurturing  I described how FIT and PAIN framework applies to the target customer profile  So let s break down what constitutes FIT PAIN characteristics of the target customer   Before you start with discovery interviews  you need to choose a framework that you will consistently use during the interviews  The framework is just an Excel table or Word doc that you will use to summarize every interview   Based on your initial discovery interviews  you will develop detailed target customer profiles with a set of values that correspond with each target customer profile involved in the buying process  The rest of the process involves careful fine tuning of your value statements by validating your assumptions with another round of interviews  Only when your value statements are finished can you move on to designing higher level messaging such as your positioning statement  25 word description and tagline   First  you have to pick a set of tools that you will be using consistently throughout this process  You will need to select a target customer profile and a strategic messaging framework  The target customer framework will ensure that you record initial discovery interviews in a consistent and structured way  We ll discuss this in more detail later   Let s assume for the purpose of brevity that you ve thought about and developed the  why  vision statement for your organization  After that  the design process for strategic messaging can be broken down into a series of discovery validation feedback loops   There are different techniques for positioning  against a competitor  a market leader  a follower  product attribute benefits  users  etc  In some cases  you can create perception of the product by focusing on just one word or phrase  To fully explain positioning  we d need at least another article and more likely a book  Meanwhile  check the reference section for great books and resources on the topic of positioning   Slack is another great example of positioning  Slack positioned itself from the beginning as an anti email app instead of just another enterprise communications tool  Stewart Butterfield   the founder of Slack  doesn t actually believe Slack will replace email but his beautiful positioning strategy has forced people in tech to talk about Slack and take sides  You know your positioning works when major publications are writing headlines such as   How E Mail Killer Slack Will Change the Future of Work     One of the most successful examples of positioning in tech was accomplished by Salesforce   Salesforce   not software  This absolutely brilliant idea by Marc Benioff led to complete domination in enterprise software marketing for the last 16 years  And the concept is still working well to this day   Positioning techniques are widely used in politics  In every race  opponents take positions on the opposite side of the issue or on the opposite side of the solution  Let s look at the example of  pro choice  vs   pro life  positions  Which position is better framed  Pro choice implies the opposite position of against choice or anti choice  Pro life implies the opposite position of against life or anti life  Since our perception views life as more important and more valuable than choice  we subconsciously perceive the pro life position as the stronger argument   Let s look back at our example  Investors are very familiar with Uber s business model  so when a founder describes their venture as  Uber for laundry   it quickly resonates with investors  They make a clear connection by applying Uber s business model to the applicable business  in this case  to a laundry business  Uber is already positioned in the mind of investors  therefore  connecting a new idea to an existing perception allows the receiver of the message to understand the new concept with limited use of mental energy   Positioning does not explain all the details of what a product does and especially how  In fact  positioning is not even about your product  it is about the perception of the prospect  customer  or investor regarding your product  This is a critical point  the answers to a positioning problem are outside of your product and even your company  they are in your prospect s mind  In other words  the way you describe and position your product should be dictated by your customers and prospects  and not by product features or internal expertise   This is the main reason why startup founders often present their ventures as  Uber for X  or  Airbnb for Y   Our attention span is short and investors are no exception to this rule  It is critical for founders to explain their ventures quickly so that investors and prospects understand what the company does and whether they are interested in learning more   Al Ries   the father of brand positioning   in his book   Positioning  The Battle for Your Mind   describes the basic approach of positioning as not a process of creating something new and different  but a way of manipulating what s already in the mind  to retie the connection that already exists   The goal is to position the product in the mind of the prospect    1   Out of all the pieces that constitute  How  a company explains its vision and value  positioning is often a forgotten strategy in the tech industry   Don t change the message too often  preferably never This is related to consistency  You can t release a new strategic messaging framework every 6 or even 12 months  It s okay to test new messaging ideas in the field  but anything that impacts the brand as a whole needs to be done incredibly carefully  Perception about your product and company aren t easy to change  Position your strategic message for the long term   Avoid superlatives and buzzwords You would think that in 2016  companies would realize how big of a turn off superlative words are    state of the art    best in class    world class    leading    but many don t   Often we don t know the difference between AI and machine learning  but these words are often used as if everybody understands them  And how about  cloud based  and  big data   Do your customers actually know what they mean   Startups often make the mistake of creating positioning and messaging based only on their internal expertise and product features  This approach entices founders to describe their products using industry jargon  complicated technical details  or buzzwords   Define  don t assume Don t assume that your audience understands terms that you use in your communication  Companies live in bubbles  employees use the same terms and very often the meaning changes from one company to another  Define terms that you use internally  and when necessary define them for outbound communication  Even simple terms such as  analytics  can have multiple meanings and interpretations   When too much information is communicated  our unconscious process arbitrarily chooses which words seem most relevant in the moment  Most of us believe it s best to give more detailed descriptions  not realizing that the audience can only focus on four tiny chunks of information and for a very brief period of time  Irrelevant speech disrupts patterns and interferes with judgement and learning   5   Our consciousness consists of the thoughts  feelings  and sensations that we are aware of at any given moment  and it represents a very limited view of reality  We can t consciously pay attention to every detail  so the brain takes all the words and implied meanings and summarizes them into a momentary thought   Brevity and simplicity leads to clarity Avoid fancy words and use more conventional language  There is a place for longer product copy or longer content  but strategic messaging is not that place   Messages should be consistent Consistency reduces opportunities for miscommunication  Consistent messages are more likely to become memorable  Consistency improves message effectiveness  that s why advertising works   it consistently repeats a simple message over and over again   Before we jump into a specific real world example of how to create a strategic messaging map  let s first highlight what makes effective strategic messaging  why certain messages are effective and others aren t   Every form of communication from the message on your homepage to the  About  section on your press releases  sales decks  paid acquisition campaigns and content strategy should align with your strategic messaging framework   Effective messaging is similar to a fine story  it puts less emphasis on what happens than on to whom it happens and why and how it happens   8  Strategic communication  or strategic messaging  covers why  how  and what a company does   Now  let s apply this framework to strategic messaging   Why  communicates the vision for your organization and manifests itself in taglines  slogan  vision statements  and in short descriptions of a company   How  is explained through your value proposition  problem description  and positioning through the eyes of your target customers   What  is described through your product and service descriptions  features  case studies and other product and marketing related content   Strategic messaging is an extension of your company s vision  A vision starts with  why   Simon Sinek popularized in his book    Start with Why    the idea is that to be successful  companies have to start with  why   Why does the organization exist  Why driven vision leads to the next question of  how   How does the organization do what it does  And finally  only after an organization is clear on  why  and  how  does it answer the question of  what   What exactly does the organization do and what products and services does it provide   As discussed earlier  the goal of marketing is all about controlling perception and changing behavior  Strategic messaging is an essential part of this goal   Strategic messaging is a value based communication framework that companies employ in all interactions with stakeholders   employees  prospects  customers  partners and investors  Strategic messaging communicates product value to the customer by describing the solution to a problem   Even though it s difficult to calculate the ROI of effective strategic messaging  it s important to realize that messaging has more of an impact than almost anything else in business  In the following sections  we ll learn more about strategic messaging and positioning  We ll also find out why they are essential to your business and how to design your own strategic messaging   Now compare what message your organization communicates and how customers perceive your product  Most companies are very shocked to find out how far apart their internal messaging is from their customer perception   During interviews  the customer may respond that he she likes or dislikes the product because of one feature it has  Always follow up with  Why   questions  It is never about the feature of the product  it is about how this feature impacts their daily work and what value and utility it provides   You will talk to your customers and prospects when you start designing your new messaging  It would be very inefficient to interview your customers once for evaluation and again when you are designing the new messaging   External Evaluation External evaluation of your strategic messaging can be done in two ways  1  customer interviews  2  with a survey  Surveys are quicker and easier  but interviews are more valuable  If your internal evaluation was enough to convince your team to review your messaging  you probably don t need to do an external evaluation   But let s imagine your internal message is reasonably consistent  then the next step in evaluation is to interview a few customers and compare how they perceive your product and your company  Remember  strategic messaging and positioning is all about the perception in your customer s mind  So your messaging could be simple and consistent but still doesn t match the perception in the mind of a customer   When conducting one on one interviews with salespeople at one company  I was shocked at how different the product pitch and company description was from one interview to another  I interviewed one sales rep and then heard a polar opposite pitch from the next sales rep  In this extreme case  almost every sales rep had their own sales decks  I then shadowed their live sales calls with customers to compare what they said during interviews and how they presented to prospects  Some sales pitches were so far apart that if you didn t know the company name  you would think the pitches were for different products   The answers you receive in the internal survey from different teams and even from members of the same team are often so different it will convince your organization to take messaging seriously   This exercise shouldn t take more than 20 minutes  If the answers you receive from the internal survey are fairly consistent  the next step will be to talk to your customers  The problem is that you might have a very consistent  but still ineffective message  Your message might be consistent and still not resonate with your customers  This is why the next step is to understand the value and utility of your product by interviewing your current customers   These are very basic questions that everyone in your organization should know the answers to  To make it even more interesting  you can also ask your team about the company vision   Why we do what we do   Internal Evaluation This quick  20 minute exercise will help you understand how your own team talks about your company and product  Get all your sales reps  marketing  and product people  ideally  encourage all of your organization participate  in one conference room  and ask them to write answers to the following questions   Here are just a few questions that you can ask your team  and then compare the answers  The simple exercise that we are about to discuss can be done quickly and the insights will help you understand the health of your messaging  so you can spot small issues before they grow into large problems   Does everyone in your organization communicate the same product value  Do your customers and prospects understand the value and utility that your product provides   One of the main attributes of strategic messaging is consistency  Effective messaging is always simple and consistent  The best way to evaluate your current messaging is to look at how consistently your organization talks about your products and compare that with how your current customers talk about your product   The symptoms of ineffective messaging aren t easy to spot  Organizations collect and analyze almost every imaginable metric  but how do you know your messaging is working  It is impossible to say that your sales process is prolonged by X  because prospects are too confused about your offerings  But there is a qualitative way to analyze your current messaging   It is hard to imagine anything that has more impact on your organization than messaging  and how you communicate internally with your team  externally with the marketplace and your target audience  We have only discussed a few critical examples  but this list can be expanded  Now  how do we know if our current messaging is effective or needs a revamp   Recruiting Recruiting is about selling your vision and your values as an organization  The founders and CEO should never stop recruiting  and need to dedicate a significant portion of their time to their recruiting efforts  Recruiting is nothing more than selling your company to a prospect  Strategic messaging will help you organize your vision and your values so you have a simple message and story that sparks interest in those who share your values and who are inspired by your vision   Strategic messaging is how companies control perception in the marketplace  It is the responsibility of the marketing team to ensure that the message a company uses is consistent across all marketing channels as well as across all assets and communications   Here are a couple of examples  Awareness content enlightens prospects and customers on industry trends and important issues  The goal is to control the perception of what your target audience should pay attention to  Running paid acquisition campaigns initiate an action by a prospect which leads to conversion   behavioral change  Buying and using a product requires a change in behavior   Marketing The goal of marketing is to control perception and to change behavior  This is a simple and accurate definition of marketing  All marketing activities and every aspect of marketing falls under the goals of controlling perception  changing behavior  or both  Try to think of a marketing activity that doesn t fit this goal  And ask yourself  can you truly change someone s behavior without changing their perception   Companies with great sales organizations all have clear sales playbooks  Sales playbooks describe in detail such things as sales pitches  competitive landscapes and how to address differentiation questions  target customer profiles  typical product offerings and descriptions  and customer success stories  Strategic messaging impacts every single weapon in your sales team s arsenal   Looking at this idea from the sales perspective  do you see how difficult the sale can become if a prospect s perceptions have been formed inaccurately   The further the prospect s perceived value is from the actual value you want to convey  the more likely the deal is to be lost  It takes effort to form a perception about product and it takes an even larger mental effort to change perceptions once they re formed  That s why it is so difficult to convince people once they have an opinion  Additional facts aren t very helpful in changing people s beliefs and perceptions once they ve been formed    Your prospect will already have perceptions about your product and its value even before your qualification call or demo  This judgement will be made based on your website s content and your communication materials including ads  PR  blog articles  and cold sales emails  If expectations are wrong  or the product value is misinterpreted  it will take your sales team much longer to change this perception   Selling a product to multiple stakeholders involved in the decision making process complicates and prolongs sales cycles  Each target customer involved has different pains and values they are trying to get from your product  Therefore  where there are multiple stakeholders  strategic messaging is even more critical  since different messages need to address the different personas in the buying process   Sales My earlier article  How to Design Lead Nurturing  Lead Scoring  and Drip Email Campaigns   points out that identifying a prospect s PAIN and FIT is a critical step in the sales process  FIT corresponds to the target customer profile  And PAIN  or problem  is how prospects perceive product value  Both target customer profiles and values are irreplaceable parts of strategic messaging   There are already a few great resources on creating a pitch deck  so let s not spend much time on this topic here   Fundraising and investor decks Strategic messaging is an essential part of your fundraising efforts  Your investor deck can describe a problem  vision  value proposition  positioning  target customer  and market opportunity  And to be successful in planting your message you have to create an interesting and easy to follow story  A successful investor deck is a strategic message packaged in an interesting story   To paraphrase Peter Drucker  it is not about searching for the right organization  it s about management needing to learn to look for  develop  and test the organization so that it fits the task  There is no right or wrong way to organize a business  But there is a right organization for specific problems or market needs   Company market fit is difficult to achieve without clear strategic messaging  Getting to the right message is as important as getting to the right product  The main reason why it makes more sense to talk about company market fit rather than product market fit is that it is not just the product that satisfies market needs and customer pains  The right organizational structure and vision are also needed to fit a particular need in the market   Company market fit might be a better framework for us to use  Company market fit is a combination of product pain  or problem  fit and message customer fit  When we only talk about product market fit  we often overlook an important component in this process   strategic messaging   In order to find sufficient demand in the market  a company not only needs to solve a real pain for target customers but it also needs to find an effective approach to communicate its product s value  Product market fit does not exist without message customer fit   The right message needs to repeatedly reach the right customer in the right market to validate the startup s existence   Product market fit also means message customer fit We all know about product market fit   which is essentially finding sufficient demand for your product in a big or growing market  What we often forget is getting to product market fit means getting to message customer fit as well  Convincing early customers to buy is essentially testing not only how a product solves a customer s pain  but also how its value is communicated   Before we discuss how to define  evaluate and design your strategic messaging  let s look at specific business areas and see how strategic messaging impacts all internal and external communication in your organization   If an organization exists   it communicates  Every company uses messaging and positioning  Whether or not it s effective is another question  But all organizations communicate their vision and product value in one way or another   Messaging is a key part of building any great company  Every business organization has a purpose and vision which leads it to develop products that solve the pain of specific types of customers  or create such customers   As Peter Drucker pointed out    there is only one valid definition of business purpose  to create a customer   The process of creating a customer is a process of communicating your vision and values to the right set of customers in the market  Strategic messaging facilitates this communication  Customers never buy just a product  they evaluate its value utility and buy your vision   Strategic messaging and positioning are often overlooked by tech companies  It s difficult to quantify the impact of bad messaging  And it s just as difficult to present any accurate ROI for implementing or changing the approach of how we talk about a company or product  Think about Gary Vaynerchuk s response to a client who wanted to know the ROI of social media  He asked her   What s the ROI of your mother    check out the video    And in some respects ROI on messaging and positioning is as difficult to quantify   This is what a final strategic messaging map looks like  The order in which you fill it out is important  so we will come back to that later  In the meantime  let s define each item in the strategic messaging map  see table below     Strategic Messaging Definitions  5 2  Discovery  The goal of the discovery process is to create a detailed target customer profile by collecting as much information about your current customers and prospects as you can  Create a list of questions for each person you are planning to interview to ensure quality feedback   Interview sales reps  Pick the top 5 10 sales reps to interview  The number will depend on the size of your organization  Sales reps will do almost anything to close deals and great sales people are very aware of the problems that prospects have   Ask them to identify a target customer  Ask about the easiest deals they ve closed  Ask about the biggest deals they ve closed  Ask about the toughest deal they ve closed  Ask about a recently lost prospect and the reasons  Ask them to state the pain that most customers have  Ask what questions they ask prospects to identify their pain  Ask what customers they have the best relationship with  these are the customers you will be interviewing later   Tip  make sure that you interview sales reps one on one  You want to avoid groupthink and prevent group leaders influencing the rest of the team   Interview the product owner and a few customer success managers  Interviewing sales reps is a must  but interviewing the product manager and customer success manager can give you a different perspective  Focus on questions that help you understand how customers talk about the product and how your team talks about the product with customers  Keep questions open ended and record responses   Listen to the prospect  shadow sales calls   Shadowing a sales call with a prospect is the best way to get close to your target customer  Prospects have had few interactions with your company and product and their original perception about the product aren t yet changed or influenced  The questions prospects will ask and objections that they will voice are important indicators of how they perceive your company and product  Also take note of the words they use  One of the easiest ways to improve messaging is to simply use the same words your ideal prospects are using  If you do this  you are sure to focus in on the most important points   The feedback you will receive from shadowing sales calls with prospects will often differ from what sales reps communicated during the one on one interviews   NOTE  I strongly believe that shadowing sales calls with prospects should be a must for every new employee onboarding process  regardless of their title  There is no better way to learn about your product and how customers perceive the product than shadowing a real sales call with prospects   Interview the last 5 10 lost prospects  Ask your sales reps to give you a list of 20 prospects that fit your target customer profile but for some reason the deal was lost  Send a quick and personal email to the lost customers asking to interview them for 10 15 mins to understand what played a major role in them going the other way  Give them a  20 Amazon or Starbucks gift card for taking the time to talk with you   The goal for interviewing lost customers is to understand the main reasons why they didn t buy  Maybe they are not quite the right fit  Maybe the pain that your product solves isn t big enough for them  Maybe they thought the price was too high  Maybe a competitor product fits their needs better  Ask them about their buying process and who was involved in the decision making  Ask lost customers to share the one thing that was a deal breaker   Interview the newest 5 10 customers  Since these companies just became your customers  the interactions that they had with your team and your product during the buying process is still fresh in their memory  Ask recently won customers the same same questions you asked your lost prospects   What they thought about your product  What problem they wanted to solve   What are the biggest challenges they are facing   NOTE  One of the most important questions to ask is the one about their biggest challenges  During the discovery process  ask this question to your prospects  recent customers  renewed customers  someone who has been a customer for over a year   If your product is not solving one of your target customer s top 1 to 3 pains  then your product doesn t provide significant value  It is a nice to have rather than a must have  If there are ever any changes to their budget or the economy  then your product will be on their short list for cancellation   Interview customers that have been using your product for more than 1 year  If your company is lucky enough to have been in business for at least a year  you should have customers who have renewed and those that have churned  Interview a couple of them with a focus on understanding why they use your product  how often  and what they like most about it   Interview industry experts analysts  If you are a larger organization and your product fits in a well established industry you would benefit from reaching out to Forrester and Gartner researchers  Interview researchers and analysts but take their knowledge with a pinch of salt  Most of the large research companies only release one or two reports a year on any particular industry  The market changes faster than that  and by the time a report is released it is outdated  Also  big research firms mostly concentrate on getting feedback from large organizations  so the findings in the report will be skewed toward large players   It is important to point out that if you do consult with researchers or analysts that you avoid the temptation to create a message based solely on their findings or knowledge  Many teams fall into the trap of creating analyst speak messaging as an  apparently  easy solution  but this is a big mistake because such messaging very rarely resonate with buyers   Another way to conduct a few interviews outside of your organization is to find a company and person that fits your target customer profile but who isn t a customer but is considered an industry expert  Find a way to have a 10 15 min discussion with at least a few industry experts that have something to do with your company or product   Review competitive messaging and 3rd party resources  You should have a short list of competitors against whom you want to position your product  Review their messaging and record in detail how they talk about their product and company  Quora is an incredible and very underrated resource for enterprise companies  If your product is more technical  check out Stackoverflow  Find a place or a community for your target customer and review topics and discussions  Note which questions are most popular in the community   What if you are an early stage startup   Reading thus far you might be thinking  wait  but what if I don t have a sales team yet  What if I don t have customers that I can interview yet alone customers that have been around for a year    What can a small  early stage startup do to design strategic communication  The answer to this is  focus on interviewing your prospects  Make a list of companies and people who might be interested in your product or idea  Do whatever it takes to interview them  Pay attention not only to the challenges they describe but also the terms they use  Carefully record your conversation  Position your conversations as discovery  where you truly want to know about them and their challenges  and not as sales pitches  Even if you have a product  refrain from sales pitches it can turn off your interviewees  The goal is to learn about your target customers and figure out strategic messaging and not to sell them on your product at this time   Also  keep your eyes and ears open  you might come across someone in your target audience who can be a great mentor or advisor to your team  You can t overestimate how helpful an advisor who fits your target customer profile can be early on   Summary   Carrying out initial discovery interviews is probably the most time consuming step in creating a strategic messaging map  but it is the most important one  Your strategic message needs to connect with your target audience  prospects and customers  and there is no better way to find out how to do this than to ask them directly  It is critical to keep a detailed record of your interviews so you can identify certain patterns  The next step after your interviews are completed is to start filling out your target customer profile and the values that correspond with each profile   5 3  Build Target Customer Profile  You should have plenty of notes from your discovery interview  It is now time to look for common themes  Look into overlapping feedback from your interviews  Always put customer and prospect responses above answers from your team   I find it very helpful to record interviews right after they occur  Also  I fill out my questionnaire form and then I record any ideas that are unusual or that I think are weird  Sometimes these ideas are just random opinions but some of them might hold great insight  The difficult part is that at the beginning you can t easily say which is which  So record them and try to validate them in the next interview  During your next interview present an idea and get feedback  To some degree this is a listening exercise   Example  during one interview I did with a sales rep  he shared that most customers do not understand  analytics  when it s used to describe part of our product  This was an interesting insight because analytics was an essential word in communication with customers  The company never asked their prospects if they even understood what  analytics  meant  So during my next interview with another sales rep  I asked whether customers ever proactively asked him to explain the analytics feature or whether the term analytics caused any confusion  As it turns out  this was a critical insight and if we wanted to use  analytics  in the strategic messaging  we had to frame what we meant by it   When multiple target customer personas are involved in the buying process  you will need to include all of them in your strategic messaging map  Complete your Target Customer Profile for each persona involved in the buying process   Target Customer Profiles  5 4  Identify Value Categories for Each Target Customer Profile  At this point  your value map should include the business function of your target customers including their titles and role in the buying process  The next step is to summarize your feedback from the discovery interviews and pick the most important value categories  Categorize all the feedback you collected during discovery interviews and identify the main value categories   Great quality is not a value   Amazing customer service is not a value   Cheap price is not a value   Easy integration is not a value   There is no need to describe the value category yet  just identify it  Carefully go over the notes accumulated in the discovery process and prioritize  What does a particular target customer care about  What does he she want to get out of your solution  What do your customers need   Here is an example of value categories for each target customer   Economic Buyer  CMO   CDO   Line of Business  Value 1  Revenue   Engagement   Retention  Value 2  Customer Satisfaction  Value 3  Product Roadmap Decision  2  End user   Decision Maker  Engineering  Value 1  Faster Development Cycles  Value 2  App Quality and Performance  3  Influencer   Tech Evaluator  IT Operations  Value 1  Visibility  Value 2  Mean time to resolution  5 5  Summarize Details Under Each Value Category  At this stage  we need to get into the details of each value proposition  Start filling out your strategic value messaging map with value statements  Describe the value of your product from your customer s standpoint  Your customer doesn t care about your  state of the art    patent pending    award winning    best in class  technology or your amazing new feature   explain what will they get out of using your product  What is it in for me   Keep your tone and style conversational   One helpful technique is having an actual role playing conversation  Imagine you are sitting at a bar and someone asked you what you do for a living  The conversation will go into more details  let s assume you started with  why       Why should I buy your product     Well  you will improve user engagement in your app by correlating behavior and operation metrics     Cool  but how do you do it     Most of the engagement loss is due to app crashes and performance issues  including network coverage   You can actually imagine this conversation happening  It includes short statements and it leads to a clear first impression of what the company does and how   It usually takes several interactions to write value statements that are brief  simple and descriptive  You should write 25 40 different variations of the same value statement  Try to use different words and phrases  synonyms  and other techniques to evaluate as many options as possible  Most of the options won t work and it will be easy to spot them  but this exercise is used to get your creative juices flowing   Assign every product feature to a value   Assigning every product feature to a particular value is a very insightful exercise  Ideally  you improve your product to bring more value to your customer  It is often forgotten in organizations why this capability is important and who benefits from it the most   Bullet Points help you deconstruct value statements   Value bullet points help you unpack value statements and show exactly what we mean by each value  While we can only have a very limited number of value categories  we can have many variations of how we describe the value  For example  you can say  minimize revenue at risk by proactively monitoring transaction success  or  increase revenue by proactively monitoring and optimizing transaction success    NOTE  While it is difficult to do a valid A B test to help you develop strategic messaging  there are some instances where A B testing can be very helpful  For example  testing small words and synonyms  You can run a simple Google AdWords campaign to test which works better in terms of clicks   Minimize revenue at risk  Decrease revenue loss  Proof points and Metrics help customers measure the progress towards perceived value   Proof points help organizations understand how and what customers will be measuring to analyze the benefit of the product  During initial conversations with prospects  sales reps should diagnose the current state of affairs  If you understand how your prospects measure their goals you can be more precise in analyzing and presenting some basic ideas  For example  ask your prospects early on about how much downtime their app currently experiences and then follow up with a question about whether the customer is aware of how much revenue is lost during this time  Then make sure you are armed with metrics you can use to compare this prospect to clients you already have in the same industry or similar size company   Understanding how customers track success will help you in content marketing because it depends on your target customer profile or industry vertical  You can highlight different metrics in whitepapers  case studies  or paid acquisition campaigns to show how your product delivers value   Below is an example of the value messaging map filled out with target customer information and one top value for each group   5 6  Design Top Tier Messaging  There s enough information on designing top tier messaging such as product descriptions  slogans  and positioning statements that you could write a whole book about it  I m not going to cover the whole topic in this article  but let me highlight a few important items   Tagline headline is a 5 word description that defines your category or a catch phrase  For example   Metadata io   Demand Generation on Autopilot  Marketo   Best in class Marketing Automation Software  Intercom   Customer Messaging Platform  25 word description statement is a one sentence description of your company  This sentence will appear first on the  About Us  section  it can be present in full or partially on your homepage  and it will be a part of your company description across social media profiles and in your PR   Many companies also have a longer version 50 word description  It usually consists of 1 3 sentences and provides a litle more information about company values  target customers  and the problem it solves   Using the same strategy you used when designing your value statements is helpful here  Write at least 25 40 different variations of a one sentence description  Thinking around the variation of this formula will help you   Company  does   value  to  help   target customers  with  problem    Examples   Marketo provides the leading engagement marketing software and solutions designed to help marketers  TARGET CUSTOMER  develop long term relationships with their customers   from acquisition to advocacy  VALUE    Zendesk builds software for better customer relationships  PROBLEM   It empowers organizations to improve customer engagement and better understand their customers  VALUE    Intercom is the first to bring messaging products for sales  marketing   customer service to one platform  VALUE   helping businesses avoid the stiff  spammy status quo  PROBLEM  and have real conversations that build real connections   5 7  Review   Get Feedback   Iterate  Your first full strategic messaging map is likely to be far from perfect  It is time to gather sufficient  high quality feedback from your team and outside stakeholders  While you are likely to encounter people jockeying for their perspective to be included  it is important to have clear vision and the confidence to defend difficult choices  Again  I would suggest one on one conversations instead of group discussions  If you are leading this strategic messaging initiative you have to design a good story and work your new messaging into it   During your discovery interviews you should have received many ideas on how to develop your messaging  At the review stage  go back to your customers  prospects  industry experts  advisors and investors  and present them with your new strategic communication map   Books have been written  seminars exist  and hours of information can be found on the topic of developing a story that resonates with the audience  It is out of the scope for this article but you can find a few amazing books and resources in the reference section at the end of this article   NOTE  Outside consultants can be extremely helpful for companies that are going through the process of designing strategic messaging  There are several reasons for this  1  They can evaluate current messaging with fresh eyes  2  They aren t tied to internal politics  3  They are less affected by any internal product or cultural biases   Strategic messaging can t be designed in a couple of days  It takes time to interview internal and external stakeholders  to understand your target audience  its pains  values  and perceptions  I can t stress enough how crucial this discovery process is in designing your messaging  Every piece of feedback is an opportunity to look at your company and product from a unique perspective  The wider the range of ideas you collect  the better and more thoughtful your strategic messaging will become  Not every idea can be satisfied by your strategic messaging map  but you will certainly benefit from analyzing and evaluating as many different perspectives as possible   PART 6  How to implement new messaging in organizations  After a couple of rounds of reviews and feedback  your organization should come up with a final strategic messaging map  Every single person in your organization needs to know your core message  From executives and their assistants to junior tech support people  It is a good idea to include messaging as a part of your new hire onboarding process   The new core message will drive many activities across your organization  most importantly in sales and marketing departments   Update your sales playbook  sales scripts  and sales enablement content   Designing Value Diagnostic questions is just one example of how strategic messaging will enable your sales team to ask the right set of questions early on in the sales process  Back to the example we used previously  since engineering cares about Agility  Faster Development Cycles   what questions can we ask a prospect to understand if this is a pain they can relate to  For example  in the table below each value category corresponds with a specific question that can help your sales team identify what value a prospect cares about most   Strategic Messaging   Sales Playbook  Align your content marketing strategy with your new strategic messaging   Strategic messaging speaks in your buyer s language and provides two key elements that lead to effective content  1  who is the audience  2  what do they care about  The notes you have collected during customer interviews should be a great source of content ideas  Some companies are struggling to come up with topics to write about and this almost always signals that the team needs to get closer to their customers and prospects   The example of the company that we use in this article has three persona profiles involved in its sales cycle and for each persona we discovered 2 3 values  When your team brainstorms content topics  ensure that every topic falls under a specific value and specific target customer  It doesn t have to be perfect  some topics will overlap  But this approach will keep your content strategy organized and your team will be aware of how often each value is covered and what target audience is involved  Before any content is written  look at your table to see who you are writing for  audience  and what theme  value  you are highlighting   Economic buyers and decision makers have greater importance in the buying process than influencers  Therefore  estimate the proportion of content created for each persona  In the example in the table below  it would be reasonable to decide that 50  of all content needs to target the CMO CDO  economic buyer   30  of content is related to Engineering  and 20  of content is created for IT Operations   As for value categories  keep track of how often you create content for each value  For example  the CMO persona has 3 value categories that the company needs content for  Balance it out by using a content breakdown ratio such as 3 2 1  for every 3 stories that are related to revenue value you should create 2 stories that cover customer satisfaction and one that is related to product roadmap value   There is no exact science on how to break down your content coverage for each buying persona and for each value category  Just remember that more content should be targeted to the target customer that has a higher influence on the buying decision  And don t forget that a higher influence on the buying decision doesn t always mean a higher position in the organization  At the same time  some values are more important  so adjust your content marketing strategy accordingly   The table below shows how topics can be sorted based on audience and value category   Strategic Messaging   Content Strategy  TIP  When you track your content performance  put it in the context of target audiences and value categories  Over time  you will see that some values perform better and you can optimize and adjust your content topics and calendar accordingly   Now that you have your strategic messaging map  you can better adapt your content to match your target personas and their related values  By doing this  your content will be more valuable to them  and the decision makers will be able to more easily understand your product s value   Every aspect of your internal and external communication should change with your new strategic messaging  We ve only discussed a couple of examples related to marketing and sales in this article  but all communications including marketing campaigns  PR  and webinars should go through the strategic messaging filter   Summary  Hopefully  this article has helped you realize that strategic messaging communication has a tremendous impact on the success of your company and product  The easiest way to check the health of your messaging is to compare how different members of your team describe your product and company   Designing strategic messaging is definitely worth the effort  even though it s impossible to provide an exact ROI of strategic messaging  Simple and concise messages resonate with your prospects and lead to less friction in the sales process  Strategic messaging drives effective content strategy since it helps your organization focus on target audiences and their values  These are just a couple of examples of how messaging impacts the communication process between a company  its customers  and the marketplace  That s why many top tech companies dedicate their time to developing the right message   While your core  why  vision statement starts from the values of your organization  the  how  and  what  is driven by understanding your target customers  Interviews during the discovery process are not only an essential part of strategic messaging design but also can uncover insights into the daily life of your target customers  industry trends  and product ideas   This article is not meant to be a comprehensive source on

106,training-dataset/product/594.txt,product,Product launch  a gated approach to customer testing55 Flares 55 Flares    When you launch a product  you rarely ever run just a single customer test of the capabilities and features   it tends to be a series of tests that follow each other  much like Stage Gate for the development of new products   This  gated  approach allows you to balance the risks of widening your audience against your confidence that customers love your product   To show this more tangibly  I d like to talk about a recent project I led that involved the launch of a new broadband service offering for customers  During this initiative  we split the customer testing into three stages   Gate 1  Prove that the product and systems work  We chose a small number of trial users who were heavily incentivised and motivated by being the first onto the product  Because of the nature of the new service  which involved doing installations in customer homes  it was practically impossible to do an entirely realistic lab test  As such  these users were the first to experience an order traversing end to end between a new operations support system  OSS   business support systems  BSS  and interfaces to the physical installation via our engineer field force   We asked these alpha customers to test the priority scenarios that we felt were critical to the product and customer experience  in effect we were having to lab test the product in the live environments with real customers in their own homes  Considering that this was a test to identify issues rather than get an impression of the service  there was no issue with incentivising customers   effectively we were paying them to help find faults with our service   Gate 2  Test the  real  customer experience via a soft launch  Up to Gate 1  the audience had been warmed up to expect faults  as we did not have full confidence that the service could be installed and run correctly  For Gate 2  we were looking to prove that the service met the needs of real customers and that all sales  installation and support elements worked well   We therefore progressed onto a larger  but restricted  volume of customers who had no incentives  This group of customers were used to establish how real customers paying for the services perceived the product and how well the business teams were able to support the issues these customers experienced   This meant we had the ability to get views on the product and what improvements needed to be made without a major product launch or the risk of uncontrolled volumes of users overwhelming our provisioning and support teams   Gate 3  Testing take up of the product  Our business case was focused on how many customers in the target geographic base took up the product  Once we d proved that the service met the needs of the customers  we encouraged take up   without any limitation on volume   to see whether customers really wanted it  We also experimented with channels and marketing approaches so that we could achieve the business case targets   Getting real customers to pay for the product might be considered as a launch in itself  However  without proving the business case in this one geographic area  the business was not going to expand its investment into other regions  This decision to progress to a national scale was the real  launch  we were working towards   Each gate in this process had clear metrics and approval groups who needed to agree that they were comfortable before the customer test could progress to the next stage  In some of the stages  we even broke the approval into  sub stage  gates so that the project team could gain confidence that all issues were being addressed  This is a particularly rigorous gating system  but it is a very effective way to ensure that you re getting all the data and confidence you need   Using your trial feedback  The big question that comes with any such customer test is how you then make decisions based on the information you ve received  Extremely positive or negative results are relatively easy situations to interpret if  that is  you can trust the results   An example of this that I ve faced recently is with regard to aerial installations  we were finding that one of the biggest reasons for customers cancelling a sale of our TV platform was because when the engineer arrived the user didn t have an aerial  We trialled a discounted aerial installation service  but even when we gave the installation away for free take up was practically zero  Customers simply weren t interested  This was such a counter intuitive conclusion that we re ran the test with a different audience  It became clear that this product just wouldn t be successful  Instead  we focused our effort on preventing sales taking place to customers without a working aerial   In reality you usually find yourself somewhere in between a wholehearted yes and an emphatic no  It s at this point that the skill and experience of a product manager comes to bear  ensuring that an organisation makes the right decision about how to progress   A staged approach lets you manage the risks  Going big bang for any activity does have its advantages  However  when it comes to testing with customers  the speed benefits of a big bang customer test or launch needs to be balanced against risks of failing to get the feedback you need  alienating your future advocates  and potentially damaging your brand  I d therefore argue that  in most circumstances  you re better off balancing out the risks with a series of gated review points  in exactly the same way that Stage Gate lets you balance out the development of a product with a series of commercial and technical validation checkpoints,"[106 378 13 80 328 549

109,training-dataset/business/755.txt,business,How Amazon Web Services  AWS  Achieved an  11 5B Run Rate by Working BackwardsHow Amazon Web Services  AWS  Achieved an  11 5B Run Rate by Working Backwards  In 2006  after Amazon Web Services  AWS  helped pioneer what we now call the cloud  product development changed forever  What once took millions of dollars and a team of engineers to create  a lone developer could suddenly hack together in half an hour  Today  one third of daily internet users visit websites built on top of AWS   AWS is now an  11 5B run rate business and has made up for an incredible 67  of Amazon s operating revenue last quarter   According to the Wall Street Journal  the cloud unit has pushed  Amazon to record profit    Amazon achieved such success by taking a  working backwards  approach to product development  In a Quora thread  Ian McAllister  Director of Airbnb and former GM of Amazon describes the process    For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product  The target audience for the press release is the new updated product s customers  which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology  Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem  how current solutions  internal or external  fail  and how the new product will blow away existing solutions    Working backwards is a framework for how to think about product without lengthy roadmaps that end up being scrapped  It s a way to short circuit the traditional product development track  and make sure that you build something that your customers will actually care about   How Amazon Works Backwards  Amazon starts their development process with what s usually the last step when building products the press release  Take a look at the 2006 press release for Amazon s S3 Simple Storage Service  one of the first and best known AWS products to be launched   It looks simple  but when he was putting together a pitch for Amazon Web Services  the current head of AWS Andy Jassy tore through 31 drafts of the initial press release before taking it to Jeff Bezos   The landing page for Amazon S3 today doesn t look so different from the original press release  What s really amazing is how little the press releases have changed over the past seven years  especially considering the speed and scale at which AWS took over the cloud  Just two small paragraphs have been added to the current product description   The massive scope of the original product vision  a simple web service interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web  is unchanged  Amazon was working backwards from  a mental image of a college kid in his dorm room having the same access  the same scalability and same infrastructure costs as the largest businesses in the world   Today  Airbnb  Yelp  Slack  and Netflix are all hosted on Amazon s servers   The path to a finished product is always rocky and requires countless workarounds and timeline adjustments  Starting with a press release makes sure you re still working towards that same customer centric end goal  As you build your product out  you use the press release as a guiding light   In your  working backwards  document  describe the problem that you re trying to solve  and how your product does it in a unique way compare to the competition  If your product s features sound boring and dry to customers  don t build them because they probably won t get adopted  These days you can write a blog post instead of a press release since that s the new most common medium used to communicate the launch of a product or service  Rewrite the blog post until you have something you d be happy publishing  Rewriting drafts is much less expensive than rewriting code   How You Can Create Better Product Development Habits  It s not enough just to tell your product team to write a blog post and expect them to automatically start thinking about the customer  The reason why the  working backwards  approach has been so successful for Amazon is that they ve sewn customer centricity into the fabric of the entire company   Deep product habits have to be built over time  through small triggers that motivate action   Here are a couple proven tactics for building better product habits   Give the customer a chair in the meeting  At Amazon  every meeting that Jeff Bezos attends has an empty chair representing the customer the  most important person in the room   This is a strong reminder to everyone at the highest level of the food chain that the customer holds the throne   At Amazon  every meeting that Jeff Bezos attends has an empty chair representing the customer the  most important person in the room   This is a strong reminder to everyone at the highest level of the food chain that the customer holds the throne  Consider scrapping your product roadmap  Product roadmaps never actually hold up

product roadmap carries very real development debt  to stakeholders that you ve promised new features  Instead of working forward on a product roadmap  work backwards from the customer to inform your product roadmap and ensure it s focused on your actual customer needs   Product roadmaps never actually hold up past the first month or so  Often  product roadmaps represent commitments that shouldn t be kept  As David Heinemeier Hansson  co founder and CTO of Basecamp writes   Accepting new entries into a product roadmap carries very real development debt  to stakeholders that you ve promised new features  Instead of working forward on a product roadmap  work backwards from the customer to inform your product roadmap and ensure it s focused on your actual customer needs  Force customer centricity into the code  All the way back in 2002  Jeff Bezos issued a 6 point mandate to engineers at Amazon  One of the key points in the memo was that  all service interfaces  without exception  need to be externalizable   This meant that everything engineers at Amazon built internally even software that never saw the light of day needed to be built as if the customer would use it  These constraints forced Amazon engineers and developers to think of the customer as they wrote code  Today this mentality is hardwired into the company   Working backwards isn t a silver bullet that guarantees you success on the scale of AWS  It simply forces you and everyone in the company  to build around the customer   Focus on the Things that Don t Change  Most founders start their company with the customer in mind  But the founders that build lasting products are the ones that build the customer into permanent development processes  If you make the customer the center and beginning of every product initiative  no matter how big or small  you hardwire it into a central part of your company culture   Your approach to your customers is a reflection of your company s mission  It s not just about product market fit  but positioning  marketing and sales  A customer centric ethos will keep your entire company focused on building the best product possible  That s the winning strategy,"[109 328 126 1026 80 494 365 1184 741 1253 23]"

126,training-dataset/product/176.txt,product,My 8 Rules Of Great Products   The Startup   MediumMy 8 Rules Of Great Products  After building products for more than 200 000 paying customers  here s what I ve learned  so far  about making them great   Building great products requires a mix of vision  customer feedback and continuous iteration  I ve found this to be true regardless of what your product is   software  professional services  physical goods or anything else   Since I started my first company in 2001  I ve tried to learn as much as I can about what makes great products  While I m still learning  there are 8  rules  I keep coming back to when I start  advise or invest in a new company   and I wanted to share them with you here   BFBC  This acronym stands for  B uild  F or your  B est  C ustomers  Simply put  it means you give a higher weighting to product feedback from your best customers   the ones who spend the most money with you over time   This leads you to build additional products  and improve existing ones  for your best customers  who are much more likely to pay more for those new and improved products  thus helping grow your revenue faster with fewer customers and less customer support   The key thing here is that not all customer feedback should be treated equally  If one customer pays you  2 000 a month and another pays you  20 a month  the feedback from the  2 000 a month customer is actually more valuable if you use it in your marketing and product strategy to attract MORE customers like them and or if it gets them to spend more money with you via upgrades or additional products   Simply put   it doesn t take 10x the effort to get a  2 000 month customer as it does to get a  20 month customer  It probably takes 2 3x the effort but gives you 10x the revenue   Cost  Create   Sustain   When you build anything new  it s tempting to just think about the initial cost to build  source or manufacture the product  What trips most founders up  though  is the ongoing cost to sustain that product once it s live   You might get a quote from an agency to build a product for  20 000  but quickly after you launch you ll realize you need additional cash to build it out based on customer feedback  so you can improve your conversion rate  average order value  reduce customer churn  etc   I ve never seen version 1 0 of any product win a market   or generate significant  7 8 figures of annual  revenue  It always takes years of iteration based on customer feedback to generate that kind of revenue  which of course needs to be funded from somewhere   either profits or investors   Cupcake  When you re building a new product  it s tempting to wait until it s perfect and  fully featured  before you put it in front of customers  Turns out  this is the absolute wrong way to build a product   Instead  you should build the simplest version that solves a single problem and put that in front of customers for feedback ASAP   even if it s not your best work  You can then build upon that iteration of the product with customer feedback which you get much earlier in the process   This is called building a cupcake   Most startups try to build the wedding cake  the big final product  on their first iteration instead of starting small with a cupcake  then turning it into a cake  based on customer feedback  and then finally into a wedding cake  again  based on customer feedback    I first came across the cupcake strategy on Intercom s blog and it made so much sense it became one of my rules that I now use whenever I m building or advising on the creation of any new product  be it software  a restaurant  a fitness supplement  etc   Solve  Tier 1  Problems  The best products solve tier 1 problems  I ve written about that here in extreme detail  but it bears repeating   your product should solve a tier 1  or top 3  problem for your potential customers   Never  ever build a startup that solves a  nice to have fixed  problem   that s what we call a vitamin  It s nice to have  but not absolutely necessary for your customers to pay for a solution   If you build a vitamin or don t solve a tier 1 problem  people will use your product but never pay for it  And that will rip you apart   How do you know if your product solves a tier 1 problem for your customers  Well  here are a few positive signs   You get regular feedback from customers who are ELATED by your product  Your conversion rate is trending up over time and your churn refund rate is trending down  You have at least 40  product market fit with existing customers  Data Instrumentation  You can t manage what you don t measure  so it s critical to determine what your top 3 metrics are and make sure 1  your product  website  etc is instrumented to track them and 2  you have a way to see them on some sort of dashboard every day   I always like the analogy of a pilot flying a plane  If he can t read his instruments  even for a few minutes  his plane probably won t be flying for much longer  Startups are the same  If you re  flying blind  then sooner or later you ll crash into a mountain  without even realizing it s in front of you   So which metrics should you track  It really depends on your business  but you can t go wrong with revenue  AOV  average order value  and conversion rate  both website to lead and lead to customer  as a starting point   Our brain processes things in groups of 3  so I recommend having 3 primary metrics and 3 secondary metrics  which might be refund rate churn  profit and Net Promoter Score   User Experience  It doesn t matter what you sell   design is your most important  feature   Even if you sell professional services  the experience a potential clients gets when they visit your web site or arrive at your office is all part of their user experience  which will help them form an opinion of you even before they get your advice   Never sacrifice user experience and always opt for simplicity and ease of understanding over a more  fully featured  product or service offering  If you can t easily explain your products or services to the average person  then they re probably too complicated   One thing I like to do when I bring on a new founder  I coach startup founders   CEOs  or invest in a new startup is do an end to end audit of their product s user experience  I put myself in the shoes of a potential customer and walk through the entire process to find  learn about  buy and get support for their product   Every time the user experience is great  and continues to be great over time   that startup s revenue grows like a weed  Every time it s confusing  revenue growth is much tougher and in most cases very  very slow   Themed Releases  Aim to improve a specific part of your product with a single release  instead of putting out tiny improvements to many different parts of it   To do this  group customer feedback and ideas for new features thematically and then prioritize which theme you ll work on  based on   Customer happiness Revenue impact Ease of implementation  This makes your product marketing a lot easier when you launch the improvements  Instead of a sprinkle of small improvements  you make one big improvement which will be felt by more customers   Outsource Non Core  In 2016 there s no reason to do your own payroll  web design  social media updates  internal IT  telephony  etc  Startups have a better shot at winning when they are extremely focused on a single mission   and anything that gets in the way should be delegated   Necessary business processes that don t differentiate you from your competition should be outsourced to an agency or third party provider  This will give you and your team more brain cycles to focus on what matters

137,training-dataset/product/849.txt,product,A balancing act  product vision and customer expectation81 Flares 81 Flares    There are few relationships as deep and passionate as that between a start up founder and their product  Your product will dominate your thoughts all day and even through the night from time to time  You ll ask yourself questions like how can I improve my product  how can I make people buy it  is it the right product  You ll be driven constantly to innovate and change it   But do you think you have all the answers and know what is right  Or do you completely rely on external output in your quest for innovation  Mastering the balancing act between your own product vision and what people actually want is an ongoing challenge that every entrepreneur must face   The two extremes  Every entrepreneur fusses over their product  While this is to be expected  in my experience entrepreneurs fall into two categories  with the extreme examples of each category outlined below   Extreme 1  The expert  The expert knows what s up  They are usually trained and or experienced in their area of expertise  This knowledge leads to them being very self assured about their product vision  They have a clear idea where the project is heading and what kind of features it should have   The big disadvantage of this type of entrepreneur is overconfidence  By thinking they know what the customer wants and needs  they more often than not develop their product right past their target audience  Sub par sales are usually the consequence of this development style   Extreme 2  The listener  The listener is at the opposite end of the spectrum  They don t develop anything they came up with themselves  Instead  they ask the customer what they want and implement it  Although that is the right approach  the listener faces problems with execution   The listener risks a lack of innovation by implementing only what customers think should be implemented  Customers are usually neither trained in that specific field  nor do they come up with visionary ways of changing things  The resulting product tends to be an uninspired collection of already existing functions  This can demotivate an entrepreneur because the product they end up with can be nothing like what they originally wanted to build   Two ends of a spectrum  Both examples are extreme and the two ends of a spectrum that every product developer occupies  Every product developer sits somewhere on the spectrum and probably leans more towards one end than the other   However the midpoint is not the optimal point to be  Every industry has its own challenges and rules and its sweet spot has to be individually determined for your business   An example  You want to introduce a tasty new sandwich in a small town   The expert would create a sandwich  they think tastes good and starts selling it  Since they did not involve customers in the development process  they did not realise that the town is mostly vegetarian and the sales for their meat lovers bacon sandwich are lousy   The listener would spend a few weeks interviewing people and would find out about the vegetarians  But it s all pretty much downhill from there because some customers don t like tomato  some don t eat gluten  some like spicy  some don t and so on  By trying to take everything the customers say into account without having their own baseline concept  they either end up with a very plain sandwich or none at all   The right course of action in this case would be to do some quick preliminary research of the target audience  Then you create a sandwich that you think the audience will like  To validate your  design  you let people try it and criticise it  Now you go back into the kitchen and implement that knowledge  iterate  but stay with your basic concept  In the end you should have a delicious sandwich that people like and which is still your brainchild   The strategic approach  To make the sandwich example above applicable to a wide range of businesses  it has to be generalised and put into an actionable form   Step 1   Find where you are on the spectrum  Find out where on the spectrum you currently are  That is very hard to determine from the inside  Your view on what is important and what will yield the best results is biased  so you need to get help to counter this  I think the best possible approach is to work with a mentor who has experience in your field  Together you can look at your existing processes and determine how much time is spent on innovation and customer satisfaction   Step 2   Find the optimal spot on the spectrum  Find out where is the optimal spot on the spectrum for your sector  You can use the internet or even better ask people who have experience in the industry  Again  a mentor is invaluable as they can help you to prioritise between the two ends of the spectrum  This does not mean that you should let them determine where on the spectrum you sit  Through discussion and arguing the essential points of your business  you will be able to determine your unique position on the spectrum  If you can t find a mentor  looking at your competition and how similar businesses conduct themselves can give you the needed perspective   The expert needs to face the fact that they are not all knowing and that they miss out on potentially great input from customers and other people  Their biggest challenge is to get past their ego  A mentor can help to tone this down  since they are usually more experienced than the expert   The listener needs to stop being afraid of not meeting every customer s expectation  and learn that you can t satisfy everybody  as this only leads to unnecessarily complicated and expensive to develop products  Working with a mentor can give a listener the necessary confidence to claim their place on the spectrum   Step 3   Develop a strong base concept  Develop a strong base concept for your product and stick with it  Collect both customer recommendations and recommendations from people in your circle  employees  family  friends   Now compare that data with your own expectations  Equalise between the two as much as you are comfortable with   the product still needs to be something you believe in  You can make a list of features you would like to see in your product and those your customers want  Mark all the features you are adamant about having and delete those you don t think will add anything to the product  Give the same list to your mentor or someone with experience and let them do the same  All the features both of you marked are must haves and the ones you both crossed out can be discarded  Those with just one delete or one tick can be collected and stored for future development   Step 4   Improve and iterate till you re happy  Improve the product with the information you have collected and present it to your customers  Iterate till both you and your customers are happy with the result  Be mindful that the costs and benefit of individual improvements are proportionate   Conclusion  You can set up a strategic development plan to help with product development  By setting the goals you want to achieve in your product development and assigning specific deadlines you can stay in control of the process  I would plan fixed process audits along the way to evaluate if the path you re on is still the right one   Whether you consider yourself an expert  a listener or somewhere in between  you have to be aware that both ways are needed to develop a product  Find the balance that best suits you and your product and you will see your vision become a reality,"[137 23 888 1253 328 101 642 378 494 365 1142]"
151,training-dataset/product/1162.txt,product,How to develop a focused product strategy to back up your UI UX decisionsEditor s note  This is a chapter from Jane Portman s new book  The UI Audit   How can you design a successful product without knowing what exactly it should do and what audience it should target  I know   the persona  drill is the number one textbook activity for UX designers  But remember your last project  Did you have clear answers to all your  persona  questions  Or did you simply nod to the vague description written by your client   Your key to professional success  Be focused  purposeful  and adamant when it comes to product strategy  It should be your number one tool to justify UI UX decisions  After all  you re in the business to ensure your client s success  By helping them build something vague  you re rendering them a terrible long term disservice  Their product might never hit that sweet spot of product market fit  and never make them real money   Today I ll show you how to define a strong  focused product strategy  audience  goals  tasks  and objects  You can use this method for your own products  or apply it in your client work   Why product market fit is important  Before we get started with product strategy  let s look at a different key term from the world of entrepreneurs product market fit   This term was first coined by Marc Andreessen in 2007   Product market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market    Product market fit is the key thing SaaS founders should care about  Here s what you get when you nail it   You stop worrying whether people actually need your product  Your sales are great  You have enough confidence to niche down more on a certain type of audience  which makes your message more powerful and further accelerates customer acquisition   Customers are highly satisfied with a product that fits their needs so well  which results in the most effective  word of mouth  marketing  In his story of building Drip  Rob Walling describes the period of searching for the product market fit as the most painful and frustrating step  Their big hit was nailing the precise formula for  email marketing automation   both words and functionality   Then they added features  like their famous rule engine  for example  to match this new value proposition  This reduced churn dramatically and caused nearly hockey stick growth   Here s what Rob said in his interview for this book    We didn t just want to build features that doesn t help  You have to have some type of vision for where you re headed  And when we made the decision we were going to become like a lower cost  high value marketing automation platform  then we instantly knew what to build and what not to build  You re not going to build shopping cart software onto it  which some people are requesting  You re not going to build an affiliate management program  you re not going to build landing pages probably  You re not going to build that CRM upfront  There s a bunch of things that you don t need  and then we can really focus on exactly what we needed to build   As we started deploying the automation engine over the course of several months  it was obvious that our churn was dropping and our trial to paid conversion rate was going up  and that was what was getting us towards product market fit    Product market fit versus product strategy  In UI UX terms  product market fit means implementing all the promised functionality well  and streamlining the UI to meet customer needs and expectations  That is  getting out of their way while they accomplish their goals using your software   Imagine you make an irresistible value proposition  Your customers respond well to your marketing page and sign up for the product  What they see inside your product does or does not match their needs and expectations   From there  we have 2 possible scenarios  If the users fail to accomplish their goal with your software  they churn  which means your marketing money is wasted  If they succeed at their goal  they become your customers  make you money  and bring in new customers by word of mouth   UI UX absolutely depends on the variables in this formula  who your customers are  and what they came here to do  By tweaking these variables  you define your product strategy   A certain product strategy may  or may not  lead to the product market fit  To test your strategy in real life  you need to fix these variables at least for a given period of time and build a solution based on them   In this chapter  you ll determine your product strategy by answering the following questions   Who are your ideal users  What big goal do they have in mind when they sign up  What tasks do they perform daily when they log into your web app  What objects do the users handle while performing these tasks   Question 1  Who is your ideal user  paying customer    In the ideal world  you first define an audience  then research their pains  and finally build a product that solves that pain  But I wouldn t be surprised if you don t have a solid understanding of your audience yet  This is a very common mistake  There s a plethora of products out there  built and launched  that are now  looking for an audience    So it always helps to repeat the basic drill  Take a sheet of paper and write down what audience you re targeting   The criteria you can use   Basic social criteria  age gender  Professional skill set  designer  developer  copywriter   A certain stage of professional personal development  student  employee  freelancer  consultant  product owner  business owner   A certain stage of business development  getting ready to launch  gaining initial traction  scaling   A certain function they perform within their business  email marketing  sales  social media marketing  user onboarding   Certain software products they re already using  Certain places they hang out online  Certain books blogs websites forums they read or participate in  Certain events conferences meetups they attend  Samuel Hulick has selected a spectacular niche for his training materials and consulting services  user onboarding  However  he doesn t qualify his audience by skillset or occupation  Instead  he uses a purely functional qualification  people who are responsible for user onboarding   Anchoring to a software product is also super effective  You gain a whole set of proven data  much better than vague customer interviews   what work users perform  how much they pay  what language they use  You can explore their support forums  listen to customers  and identify existing problems  Your own value proposition might be solving these exact problems   Here s how Ankur Nagpal  the founder of Teachable  talks about approaching their huge audience of people who make money with online courses    We don t think of a photography teacher different from a programming teacher  or a dance teacher  We re thinking what these people were doing before  Ultimately  most people we focus on are people with an audience  So we think where do they have their audience from  do they have a large podcast  a large blog  large social media  And that s how we group them and build marketing funnels towards them   We can build marketing materials  training materials specifically to people that write books  In the next phase  we can build marketing specifically to people that make YouTube videos  And that s how we think about the market not by what people are teaching  but where they built their audience from and how they spend their online time    Here are a few more qualifying questions to make sure you re making a wise choice with your audience   Do you know them well  Knowing a certain ecosystem is a splendid competitive advantage  so you d better capitalize on your previous experience  While not knowing your customer ecosystem can ruin your business   Do you like them  As Amy Hoy says   If you don t like drunk frat boys  don t open an Irish pub   Serving people you don t like respect can be rather excruciating   Can they pay you  Are they used to pulling out their credit card online  Do they have a habit of paying for SaaS products   Do you know how to reach them  Do you know what forums sites they go to  Some customer categories are extremely  physical  and hard to find online  In such cases  plan for real life events or locations instead   Question 2  What big goal is the user trying to achieve with your web app   Your product solves a pain  What does the user try to do when they encounter that pain  What s their big goal   Always keep this goal in mind and cultivate the success related to it  Your stats and metrics should display the progress towards that goal   Good examples   Write a book  Publish a podcast  Acquire new SaaS customers  There s more to this question  In fact  this goal isn t really  big  in the user s own world  It s just prominent enough for you to build a product around it  Beneath this  big  goal always lies a sequence of other more important goals   This whole system of goals doesn t directly dictate UI decisions  but it definitely helps when you evaluate potential new features or write sales copy for your product   Here s a very basic example to give you an idea of scale    I want to  write a book   because then I can  build authority   because then I can  have better clients   because then I can  make more money   because then I can  travel more  That s a linear sequence  but in real life it s a huge network of interrelated goals and aspirations  There can easily be another branch for the same person    I want to  write a book   because then I can  have passive income   because then I can  work less   because then I can  spend more time with my kids  Look how these goals range from simple facts towards big lifestyle changes  The goal related to your product   write a book   is merely a small step in a huge life picture of your customers  But if your product does its job well  then they ll be able to focus on their bigger goals and achieve more down the road   That s why they re paying you  not because your app has pretty design  Not because it s cheap or expensive  Not because you re awesome  Realizing that will make you a humble product owner with a small ego  able to build a useful product without falling in love with it   That s your recipe for printing money   Question 3  What primary tasks does the user perform on a daily basis when they log into your web app   What is the user s daily routine on the way to their goal  What do the users do when they log into your app  List the actual creative processes  procedures  etc   A polished  streamlined execution of a few key tasks often makes a difference between good and bad software  You ll need to move heaven and earth to make these tasks obvious and easy to handle   Here s what Ankur Nagpal of Teachable says about it    When it comes to building a product  there s 2 things you can do  One is you can take the things people don t like and make them better  so they like your product overall  But what I personally like to do is find out what people like about the product  and make your strengths stronger  Because that s what makes people love a product rather than a product that s just okay in every regard    Tasks can be classified in 3 groups  analytical  proactive  and reactive  Each group is handled in a different way   Analytical tasks mean monitoring the current state of things or analyzing performance  To do so  the user looks at the dashboard or digs into reports   Proactive tasks mean creating new objects and editing existing ones  That s what we usually call  work   Some proactive tasks might require a comfortable workspace environment  some can be handled with simple forms  In any case  proactive tasks revolve around object lists  Where do all my objects live  so that I can review them and add more if necessary   Reactive tasks mean handling incoming items  replying to messages  handling bugs issues  approving reports  etc  Reactive tasks require a separate system   Notification area  a message bell icon somewhere in the top navigation bar   Instant notification mechanism  pop up notifications and such   A certain location in the app where all incoming and outgoing items are permanently stored  inbox or similar   Email by itself should never be a single way for the user to hear about any updates  even if it seems to work  The user should be able to comfortably work without leaving the comfort of your web application  Switching between the email client and the working environment can be detrimental to productivity   Usually all 3 task types  analytical  proactive  reactive  co exist within a single web app  If a certain type of task clearly prevails  this can affect the way customers use your software  Your web app can be forgotten or abandoned in the following cases   There are no reactive tasks for the user to act upon  no new messages  issues  etc    There s no external reason for the user to do proactive work with the help of your application  this often happens to freelance tools when the client work runs out   Your web application is purely analytical  then you d better send out some positive email reports   That s the worst situation to

  Question 4  What objects does the user work with   What objects does the user work with  What entities do they create and manage while performing their tasks   To answer this question  try this  crawl your list of tasks and list all nouns from there  Most likely  that will be the core of your list   Good example   subscribers  email campaigns  automation rules    Why is this list of objects so important to be a part of the product strategy   Every UI in the world facilitates tasks  but it doesn t display them it displays content  a set of objects   Objects help to limit the scope of your functionality and responsibility what your application does manage and what it doesn t  Objects dictate the data structure in the development process  The primary purpose of navigation is to clearly classify and locate all objects  The primary purpose of onboarding is to tell the user what objects they ll be managing and how the objects are named  while their location should be naturally obvious from the navigation system   Important  Use your customer s vocabulary  The exact words you use to describe your product strategy are equally important as the strategy itself  Customers know what they want to do and have their own words for that your job as a founder is to decode this language and build a web app that s easy to understand   There s a common term for small  instructional bits of copy within a UI  microcopy  It s a very important subject  but we re not talking about microcopy here  We re talking about the words from the product knowledge domain that are used inside your web app   The exact words your product vocabulary should possess the following qualities   be familiar to the users and belong to their knowledge domain  be consistent across the web app and marketing materials  make general common sense  Names for the same things can vary greatly from one product to another  Let s look at the vocabulary of 3 popular email marketing tools   One off email  campaign  MailChimp   broadcast  Drip  ConvertKit   Email sequence  automation workflow  MailChimp   campaign  Drip   course  ConvertKit   Vocabulary depends on your positioning  too  ConvertKit  for example  was originally created for content marketing  so email sequences are historically called courses  Drip is a more versatile piece of software that targets many customer groups  so they use a neutral word campaign   It helps to borrow terms from established software products that your users know well  Drip and ConvertKit successfully use the term broadcast for one off emails  so this term is already well coined for the audience  If you were building a similar tool  it would make sense to use the same language   It s a great practice to write down your vocabulary  with explanations  in a single document  and use it for reference  You can later use this exact document for your support knowledge base   How do you build a vocabulary that makes sense to your users  Don t write it from the top of your head  Instead  research and reuse the existing language of your audience   Here s what you can do for your research   Actively organize opportunities for your audience to speak up   interviews  surveys  feedback rounds    interviews  surveys  feedback rounds Scour existing resources and materials  blogs  forums  product reviews  and support threads  Amy Hoy calls this safari because you study customers  in their natural habitat    Usually these activities take place during the product research stage  but you can jump in again while defining the vocabulary  This time you already know what you re building exactly  so the purpose will be a bit different  figure out what exact words customers use while speaking about their goals  tasks  and objects   Practicum  Take a sheet of paper and answer these 4 questions   Who are your ideal users  What big goal do they have in mind when they sign up  What tasks do they perform daily when they log into your web app  What

to users when the company started  It probably wouldn t be the Silicon Valley super unicorn that it is today  If Apple s products cost half of their current price  they might still make a profit  but they would not achieve  53B in net income like they did in 2015  What if Palantir didn t charge customers seven figure fees on a monthly basis with years long contracts  It probably would not be valued at  10B   Figuring out the right pricing for your startup is a challenging  yet crucial  part of building a successful company  The way you price your product can make or break your startup  So  it s important to understand the pricing landscape of your market and how your company fits into it to get your startup s pricing right   Dreamit recently hosted an educational panel on startup pricing for the companies in its spring cohort  Three founders and investors participated in the panel  Arie Abecassis  venture partner at Dreamit and partner at ICONYC labs   Paul Canetti  founder of MAZ   and Davide Rossi  founder of FitBark    Below is a guide to startup pricing containing the best advice  strategies  and tactics from the Dreamit pricing panel  Read on to learn more about pricing models  picking the right model for your business    common pricing mistakes   Different Pricing Models  B2B versus B2C  The way you price your product will depend heavily on whether it s business to business  B2B  or business to consumer  B2C   During the panel  Paul Canetti made the point that both B2B and B2C businesses choose their pricing based on cost plus pricing or value based pricing   Cost plus pricing is the process of figuring out the exact costs of creating your product and charging some price higher than those costs  In other words  you mark the product above its costs when using cost plus pricing to price your product   Value based pricing happens when businesses know the approximate amount of dollar value their products provide to customers  These businesses then set their price below the amount of value customers get from using their products  One great strategy for value based pricing is the 10x rule  For example  if you sell something for  100  it should have a  1 000 perceived value to your customer  at least   Via Sequoia  B2C businesses often use cost plus pricing when figuring out how much they want to charge customers  B2B businesses  particularly in the software industry  use value based pricing  But these tendencies are not set in stone   B2B businesses generally have customers pay a monthly fee for access to their software  This type of pricing could be called a SaaS or monthly recurring revenue model  When B2B companies sell to enterprise customers  they generally have them sign contracts where they pledge to pay for at least a year of service  These enterprise customers will pay in full upfront or break the value of the contract up into monthly or quarterly payments  If your B2B company wants to sell to small and large businesses  then it will likely use a combination of monthly and contract pricing   Sometimes  B2B companies have per user pricing  For example  Slack charges businesses for each user that has a  Pro  account on the site  Other B2B businesses ask users to pay a one time license fee to access their products  WooThemes and online course businesses are examples of B2B companies that ask users to make a one time e commerce payment to get the product   Some B2C companies charge consumers a monthly subscription fee to use their products  Examples of companies that do this successfully are Netflix  Spotify  Birchbox  and more  While some B2C companies use monthly pricing  the most common pricing models for consumer companies are free  freemium  and one time payments for goods   Facebook  Twitter  and Snapchat are services that offer their products to consumers for free in exchange for the right to use users  data for advertisements  Freemium B2C companies include LinkedIn  Dropbox  SoundCloud  Evernote  and more  It s more common to see freemium B2C software companies and startups  but plenty of B2B companies use freemium pricing as well   Retail and ecommerce pricing models are the most common ones used in B2C businesses  Amazon  Walmart  Alibaba  Priceline  The Home Depot  CVS Caremark  and more all have customers pay one time fees in retail and or ecommerce   How to choose the right pricing model  What should you charge customers for your product and how should you ask them to pay  Here are some ways to find the answer   Analyze the set of existing competitive products  This is how most startups and big businesses alike determine the prices for their products  Besides looking at competitors for their pricing information  you should do this anyway to get a sense of how the market looks  Find as many competitors for your product as possible and create a Google Sheet with all of their public pricing tiers and what each tier offers  Then  look for patterns in the pricing data of your competitors and decide where you want to position your product s price in the market   This is how most startups and big businesses alike determine the prices for their products

Google Sheet with all of their public pricing tiers and what each tier offers  Then  look for patterns in the pricing data of your competitors and decide where you want to position your product s price in the market  Look at what product substitutes charge  Does your product have no competitors  Is it truly innovative in the sense that it s the very first product of its kind  If your answer to both of those questions was  Yes   then you might be thinking that you have no pricing data to use when creating your pricing strategy  But  that isn t true  Every innovative product replaces some other older  inferior product  The car replaced the horse and buggy  So  if you have a completely new product  which you likely don t   look at the pricing data for its potential substitutes  Put that substitute pricing data into a Google Sheet and analyze it to find the ideal price for your product   Does your product have no competitors  Is it truly innovative in the sense that it s the very

run  or multiple trial runs  for your product s pricing  crowdfunding campaigns are an excellent idea  When starting FitBark  Davide Rossi ran two Kickstarter campaigns to fund the company s initial production runs  In the first Kickstarter campaign FitBark tested a monthly fee model  then killed the monthly fee model  and finally reactivated it later  With crowdfunding  you can raise money to start your business while testing out different pricing models and price points at the same time  Being able to accomplish both of those things is a big win That said  it obviously goes that you shouldn t run a crowdfunding campaign unless you re serious about delivering on the promises you make to backers   If you want to have a trial run  or multiple trial runs  for your product s pricing

way to validate product ideas in The Four Hour Work Week  It s also an excellent way to test your product s pricing once you know it resonates in the market  Create several different versions of the same ad for your product where the only difference between each of them is your product s price  Then  run these ads for a few days with a small budget and see which one performs the best  Use the price s  from the best performing ad s  as your product s main price s    Tim Ferriss was one of the first people to discuss this strategy as a way to validate product ideas in The Four Hour Work Week

price s   Ask current and prospective customers two key questions  To determine the optimal price of FitBark  Davide Rossi put plugins on the FitBark website that asked customers two simple questions  These questions were   At what price does this product become too expensive   and  At what price does this product feel like a steal   People who answered the questions got a  10 discount and FitBark got tons of valuable data that helped it choose the right price  With a bimodal distribution analysis  FitBark centered the price at  69  You can use a similar strategy to the one employed by Davide and FitBark to find your product s optimal price   Common pricing mistakes that founders make  In the panel on pricing  Arie Abecassis  Paul Canetti  and Davide Rossi spoke about the most common pricing mistakes founders make  Here are the mistakes you should avoid   Overcomplicating or overdoing your product s pricing early on will waste time and discourage early adopters from using the product  Instead  launch your product with one or two pricing tiers  three at the most  and add pricing segments for customers with different needs over time  When it comes to your startup s pricing in the first 12 to 24 months  simplicity should be the rule  Selling your product as having negative value instead of selling how it provides aspirational value  Some products or services allow companies to operate with fewer employees  Telling potential customers about how much they ll lower costs by laying off employees thanks to your product is an example of negative value  Instead  talk about the aspirational value of your product when selling it to prospective customers  Some examples of a product s aspirational value are productivity increases  revenue growth  churn reductions  simplified workflows  pageview growth  and more  Not thinking about pricing as a dynamic and ongoing value  You can change your product s pricing at any time and should experiment with it  especially if it s not effective  It s not a good idea to change your product s prices all the time as that will annoy and confuse customers  But  Arie Abecassis talked about how markets  competitors  products  customers  and consumer behaviors will change  As these variables change  your pricing should likely evolve as well  Not knowing what different size customers expect in terms of pricing  Enterprise customers expect very different pricing from small businesses  medium size businesses  or consumers  If you want to sell to the Fortune 500  you should know companies of that size expect to pay at least 5 figures and sign contracts when purchasing products or services  On the other hand  most small businesses expect to pay month to month for the products they use  Educate yourself about what prices different sized businesses will want and expect to pay for your product  Going to retail too early for hardware products  Instead  know everything about your customers before selling to them at retail  Davide Rossi spoke recounted a story about how BarkBox went to retail with a unified brand message way too early  Rossi wished he had done more landing page audience based marketing to learn about the specific problems dog owners faced when seeking out BarkBox  If you run a hardware company  you should take Davide s advice and truly understand your customers before selling your product at retail   Additional articles to read about startup pricing  Business pricing  especially for early stage startups  is a complicated topic   Here are some great articles  videos  and books that delve

183,training-dataset/product/738.txt,product,Using Grounded Theory to prioritise product features146 Flares 146 Flares    One of the most important responsibilities of a product manager is planning the order of features that the dev team should work on   This need to prioritise comes from a very basic constraint   a lack of resource  In a fast moving business environment   and especially in a start up   product changes should deliver the most value at each point in time   There are many ways to approach feature prioritisation  but one that has worked well for me is the Grounded Theory  GT  approach  I first came across GT when I worked as researcher for a UX consultancy  It s a bottom up approach which I ve found useful in a variety of projects  and I have endorsed it as plain common sense ever since   Hopefully  this simple way of structuring data into information will help you to make better decisions about what to work on and to defend those decisions to others   What is Grounded Theory   Grounded Theory is a qualitative research approach that was originally developed by two sociologists  Glaser and Strauss  in the 1960s   The purpose of Grounded Theory is to generate theory from empirical material  For example  if an apple hits my head 20 times  I generate a theory on gravity  Patterns and categories emerge out of the data rather than being imposed before data collection  I suspect that gravity exists  so I look for case studies supporting that belief   The theory needs to be grounded in observation  hence the term   In a way  the Grounded Theory method resembles what many researchers do when they retrospectively formulate new hypotheses to fit data   All is data   All is data  is a fundamental property of GT  It means that everything that comes the researcher s way when studying a certain area is data  With regard to product management  the data can arrive in both structured and unstructured ways   Structured   Questions from users who responded to your automated emails  Tickets from customer support team  revealed pain points   CRM software  notes  deals  email history   Customer advisory board  virtually or in person   Unstructured   Feedback from prospective customers during sales demos  Information from your sales team  reasons for lost deals   Informal talks with customers  i e  during conferences   Direct feedback from users  i e during WebEx sessions   The goal is to collect user feedback from as many touch points as possible  The more data points you collect  the better the understanding you will have of your target group s needs and pains  And as the size of feedback pool increases  the more reliable the execution of future ideas will be   Quantity first  When building products  we are driven by two thought processes  divergence and convergence   Divergence focuses on exploring possibilities to create a new understanding of a problem space  It is very much what most people think about when they consider creativity   Divergence is about creating choices  no matter how good or bad they are  This phase can be tedious as it involves drafting categories or concepts from all the data sources we can get our hands on  In product management  this means that you ve created a list of things to work on  but without assigned priorities   When you have collected a big pile of categories  the next stage is to slim down the list into a smaller set of ideas that can be taken forward for further development  This stage is convergence and requires an objective evaluation of your choices  It s about evaluating ideas with a given set of criteria  deciding what the  right  choices are  and executing those choices later on   Convergence is about making decisions   Although there are many prioritisation criteria that can be applied at this stage  value  cost  etc    the GT approach uses a basic metric  feedback count  It s a no brainer  really   How does this help in feature prioritisation   GT is geared towards getting input from the outside world  Product managers can use this qualitative approach to create a list of features  fixes and enhancements that relate to what users want   the more the merrier  Each new request expands the list   When you feel your list is saturated  you should set default priorities for each request by assigning how many times it has been reported  It s the quantitative side of the process that determines how many users would benefit from introducing each product improvement  This part can be automated by a simple SUM function in an Excel document  Each repeated request will stack up  adding weight to its priority   Here s an example   In this example  the divergence stage is reflected by the features   the columns  and the convergence stage   feedback count   Feel free to duplicate the spreadsheet for your own use   Once the list is completed it s a good idea to discuss it with your team  I strongly recommend the inclusion of more criteria before making final decisions  like cost of implementation  effort  or return of investment  impact   Your feature prioritisation should also follow and be narrowed down by your overall product strategy  i e  target group    The Grounded Theory approach is a set of simple guidelines for structuring feedback  external and internal  which should result in helping you to set product feature priorities  It s important to bear in mind that it does not go against any existing methodologies  rather it aims to support them in your decision making processes  For instance  lean start up advocates believe that customer feedback is integral to product development and ensures that the producer does not invest time in designing features or services that consumers do not want   GT approach helps synthesise which  new  features are aligned with people s needs and pains  making it easy to communicate how many of them will benefit from each improvement  It can be also useful when estimating return on investment  ROI  from product changes  For instance  if your sales team reports 10 lost enterprise deals each month due to the absence of a feature  you can help them by introducing this feature  Before that  you can project the ROI based on the cost of implementation and improved sales conversion metric   At the early stages of a start up  you probably will be able to collect feedback only from people who haven t had an opportunity to touch your product  as it may not yet exist  Working with an existing client base is different because you can assign more  weight  to the feedback and trust it more  Quality of feedback is very important   There are no hard rules on when you should stop collecting the data  It usually boils down to the timelines and benefit cost ratios  From my experience  collecting feedback from at least 15 clients  direct talks  provides enough data to feel confident on the decisions you make  You need a bigger sample when talking with people who didn t pay for your product  users   Ideally  you never stop collecting data  as each data point can provide new product feature ideas or support existing ones   All in all  Managing a product roadmap or coming up with feature priorities is not an easy task   As a product manager you need to make things happen  In order for a product to be shipped there are hundreds of things to get done   I know that for some readers this may appear to be a formalised version of their  common sense  approach  but I have always found this simple framework to be very helpful as it can provide more clarity about the need to introduce product changes   It would be great if you could share it with any friends and colleagues whom you think might also appreciate it   What s your favourite approach or mix   Please let me know in the comments below   P S  The article covers very basic information on Grounded Theory  but if you are interested in further exploring the topic in regards to product management  I recommend that you to read,"[183 502 431 1253 608 650 642 859 328 378 13]"

215,training-dataset/product/1457.txt,product,How to Tell a Better Story With Your ProductThe ancient Greeks passed stories down from generation to generation  Even before writing and reading became popular  the oral tradition of storytelling ensured that epics like the Odyssey were widely shared and would endure for many more generations to come  Today  we still enjoy stories like Hercules  Pandora s box  Oedipus  and much  much more   Storytelling has become something of a buzzword  but it s an undeniable part of how humans have always connected to one another  Storytelling skills can help people in many disciplines  from sales to HR  but they re especially useful for product teams who have just a few moments to woo users   Using techniques from powerful stories can provide that extra boost of engagement and build an emotional connection with users   Here are a few storytelling techniques to try in your product   Set the Tone of the Product in the First Moments   It was the best of times  it was the worst of times    Charles Dickens s opening to A Tale of Two Cities is probably one of the most famous first lines in literature  Not only is it poetic  but the contrast sets up some expectations for the reader  without giving away too much of the love story in war torn France   The first moments in your product experience are even more important  They don t just set the tone for your product s value  but they also determine whether or not users stay  Vivek Bedi  Head of Product at LearnVest and founder of mySwapp  describes a common first user experience   Ever go to a website and based on the first ten seconds you decide to stay on it or not  Or ever download an app and can t figure it out how to use it within the first minute and subsequently delete it  Well that s reality  Humans are impatient people  We are selfish by nature and our time and attention is valuable  If you don t have something to say that we care about you will lose us instantly  It s important when crafting your story to focus heavily on the first few minutes   One way to capture attention and set the right tone for your product is to welcome users  A friendly welcome page is a nice way to thank users for trying your product and remind them that they ve made the right decision   The meditation app Insight Timer has a great  straight forward message for new users   The welcome screen greets new users by their name and gives a brief overview of the app s benefits  There s even a few forms of social proof to help validate the product s value   Have a Hero that Everyone Can Root for  Atticus Finch  Jane Eyre  Holden Caulfield  Some of the most enduring stories rest on having a hero character that we all want to win  no matter how insurmountable the odds  We become engaged in their story because we want to see our heroes achieve their missions   Mascots are kind of like your product s hero  They are often consistent characters in the user journey  appearing in marketing pages all the way through to the in product experience  Like heroes to a story  they exemplify the main themes of your product   Mascots  even when they re animal characters  can build a more human connection with customers  says Janet Choi  Senior Manager of Product Marketing and Content at Customer io  She describes what Ami  their delightfully adorable mascot  does for the customer experience   It s that small but meaningful emotional connection to a character that feels human and expressive  Ami catches the eye  conveys a friendly personality  and ever since she came to life  we ve found that people are naturally drawn to her  Ami s whimsy and cuteness give our users tiny boosts of emotional support and delight as they navigate around our platform  where they can get in the weeds of features  Having a mascot like Ami is a visual representation of how we want to come across  communicating who we are as a company with our audience  users  and customers   The best mascots are more than just a pretty sight  As eye catching as Ami is  what is most impressive is her journey towards representing the powerful email platform  Customer io s designer sketched up several different characters  including a robot and bear  before landing on a carrier pigeon  The team had to go through several iterations to make sure that they completely nailed the mascot   And hard work paid off   When the team finally did choose Ami  they made sure she had more depth than just being cute  Ami is named after Cher Ami  a real life pigeon that saved a battalion of soldiers during World War I by delivering a message despite being wounded    Of course those are totally different circumstance  but there are strong connections to our mission to help businesses and organizations be able to reach the right people at the right time   said Janet   Use Suspense to Keep Users Coming Back  Stories often use cliffhangers to keep people engaged  J K  Rowling kept millions of readers waiting for the next Harry Potter book by planting bits of anticipation at the end of her stories  The result  A billion dollar franchise   While keeping people waiting in your product with cliffhangers sounds like a bad onboarding idea  variable rewards can inspire a similar feeling of uncertainty and excitement  Best described by Nir Eyal in Hooked  his best selling book on customer experience  variable rewards are distributed on a seemingly random schedule  Our desire for predictability makes us crave these things  think video games and slot machines  all the more   Some products have variability built into them  Tinder in effect creates many tiny cliffhangers  will the other person swipe left  will they message me  what they look like  will they be the one    Users experience variable rewards with every product interaction  driving engagement all the more   Craft an Actual Story in Your Product  What better way to use storytelling techniques in your product than by creating an actual story   A new trend in selling SaaS the self service product demo lets product owners and sales teams engage trialers by pre populating a trial account with sandbox data  This tactic works well for products that require installation  input from other teammates  or time to populate with meaningful data   Amplitude s product demo lets users slice and dice user behaviors for a hypothetical music app   At any point during the trial  users can install Amplitude to start using the product with their real data or contact sales to learn more   If a product demo doesn t make sense for your customer experience  you can also craft a story by embedding a mission into onboarding  Ptengine s user onboarding flow does a similar thing as a self service product demo on a smaller scale  It sends users on a mission as a fictional clothing store owner  Emily   Build Conflict and Resolution  Most good stories contain conflict that the protagonist has to resolve  Whether it s an external force  like Ahab s Moby Dick  or an ongoing internal dialogue  as in Crime and Punishment  conflict builds suspense and often serves as a pedometer for the story   Conflict translates naturally to storytelling in products  People use your product to solve a specific problem or to get a specific job done  Applying conflict makes the most sense while marketing the product  Take a look at Basecamp s home page   Basecamp has marketed its project management software with an eye towards the jobs to be done framework  But once users are inside the product  they receive helpful tips on how to use the software   In most cases  it doesn t really make sense to harp on conflict once users have identified with the problem and are already exploring your product as a solution   Use Time to Evoke Emotion  Endless stories have been built around the element of time and how we perceive it  Writers like Proust and Borges have played with our faulty sense of memory to craft fantastic  creative storylines   From Timehop to  tbt  it seems like more and more products are appealing to our sense of nostalgia  There is psychology to back this up  Research suggests that thinking about the past makes us fosters a sense of social connectedness  For social products  evoking a sense of nostalgia may make us want to reach out to others more  ideally by engaging more and more with the product  interestingly  feeling more socially connected also weakens our hold on money  which may explain the resurgence of throwback beer cans and vintage cereal boxes    The folks at Google are experts at perfecting the user experience and integrating services across multiple platforms  Consider Google Photo  Compared Google s other products  users probably don t check Google Photo that often  To drive engagement towards Photo  Google uses an in app widget that appears across their other products   When users click on the  rediscover this day  alert  they re not simply taken to an album with photos from the day in question  Instead  Google uses the opportunity to build suspense by blurring out the picture and compelling users to  think back    Another way to play with time in your product is to paint an inspiring future for the user  Fitness products and money management software are especially poised to do so   Signal the Importance of Something  Writers often signal the importance of something through themes  In your product  you d have to use more obvious tactics to indicate when something is worth doing   One straight forward way to signal importance is through social proof  While social proof is often used in customer stories and other marketing assets  social proof can help move users along key actions as well  PayPal uses social proof in  see for yourself why millions of people love PayPal  to ease the anxiety of trying a new product   Once users are engaged with your product  they may need nudges to indicate what s important  This can happen because there s a new feature that they should know about  or they ve forgotten about an old feature   Unobtrusive UI patterns like slideouts can help indicate where a user can explore more  See how Indiegogo uses slideouts to announce a new integration with Apple Pay   Make Your Product a Best Seller  Rudyard Kipling once wrote   If history were taught in the form of stories  it would never be forgotten    While storytelling techniques might not make your product last forever  they can change attitudes and behaviors  This isn t a guarantee of engagement  but it s a great start to building a fruitful customer relationship   Harnessing the power of storytelling in your product  even in small and subtle ways  can help build a convincing use case for your product  By evoking emotion and spurring curiosity  stories can help your product become more than just another tool,"[215 999 322 244 1253 23 348 1214 1282 1239 151]"
221,training-dataset/business/1103.txt,business,What is the Magic Moment for your Startup Early on  after Facebook launched its Feed feature  the product team at Facebook was trying to understand how to engage and retain users  What the product team noticed is that IF a user got to 10 or more friends in 14 days  there was very high likelihood of this user sticking around for a while   The team had a hypothesis that 10 friends collectively generated enough interesting activity to populate the user s feed and to keep him or her coming back  For Facebook  10 friends has literally become a magic number  because  while the exact mechanism behind it wasn t clear  users with 10 or more friends after 14 days didn t churn   CAC vs LTV  Before we dive into the Magic Moment  and why it is important  we need to talk about two other concepts Cost of Customer User Acquisition  CAC  and the Life Time Value  LTV  of a customer user   In very simple terms  CAC is related to the costs of acquiring a customer  and LTV is related to how much money the business can make per customer   To build a viable business  a startup needs to prove that it can acquire customers as inexpensively as practical  and retain them for as long as possible   There is a set of formulas and calculations establishing the fact that for the business to be attractive  it is important to pay back CAC within 12 months  and that LTV needs to be at least 3x of CAC  Read this awesome post by David Skok to understand the details of these calculations   Things get tricky quickly though  because not only do you need to acquire customers  you need to retain a lot of customers   Many startups are able to sign up users but not retain them because the product isn t compelling or sticky enough  Customers sign up  but quickly churn  In this situation  Life Time Value of the customer is too small to offset the cost of acquiring the customer  So the business can t be profitable  and it can t survive   The Magic Moment  The  Magic Moment  helps solve for business sustainability   Here is how you can think about it  A customer performs a sequence of actions from signing up to using the product in various ways  Each combination of actions defines a path  and puts the customer into a specific state   The Magic Moment is a very special state once a customer reaches that state  the probability of the customer churning in the future is dramatically lower  To put it differently   An average customer that hits the Magic Moment will stay a customer for a long time  will have high LTV  and will be profitable for the business   If this seems like a backwards definition  it really is   The idea is to work BACKWARDS from the desired state  a RETAINED  LONG TIME  HIGH LTV CUSTOMER  and to understand the path to get there   Take a look at the diagram above  In the case of Facebook  a user would sign up  then do a whole bunch of things  and then eventually  within 14 days  got to 10 friends  That happens to be a Magic Moment for Facebook  because an average user who makes 10 friends in 14 days does not churn for  say  3 years  Getting users to friend 20 people guarantees a viable business for Facebook   Next  let s consider Netflix  If a user signs up  but doesn t watch any movies  sooner or later she will cancel the service and churn  We can guess that for Netflix  the Magic Moment has to be a function of number of movies watched per unit of time  For example  if the user watches at least one movie a month for 3 months  he or she will stay with the service for 2 or more years   Magic Moments apply equally to all kinds of businesses  including Enterprise Software  For B2B  the Magic Moments are a lot more complicated  A sale is just a prerequisite to a Magic Moment  but it doesn t guarantee it  For example  if a company buys a security solution  but doesn t see clear ROI  it will likely cancel the subscription  Ongoing usage and utility are requirements for non churn in B2B  and should be factored into the Magic Moment   How to get to YOUR Magic Moment  The trick to finding YOUR Magic Moment is to have a hypothesis of what it is that gets the customers hooked  and will keep them hooked   To figure it out  you need to be kind of like a scientist in the lab have an intuition of where you want to get to  but be flexible on how you get there   Start by building the minimum funnel  where each state progressively gets the customer to what you believe will be the Magic Moment state  Think hard about why you believe this state is the Magic Moment  Figure out why the customer would keep coming back  What is the feedback loop   Secondly  think about the funnel over specific period of time  For Facebook  14 days or two weeks was the time needed to reach 10 friends  What is the right period of time for you  For most services  because the customer s attention span is so short  first few moments  first day and first week of usage are critical  If the customer is not activated  they aren t likely to be retained   After you build your funnel  keep measuring and analyzing it  There is no way to know for sure until you get enough data on your Magic Moment  on the path to it  and on the churn overall  Once you have the data  you should be able to  through the process of experimentation and refinement  to get to the Magic Moment for YOUR business   Once you figure out what the Magic Moment is  you then need to figure out how to optimize the funnel that gets every single customer to that state  You do that with a set of nudges that moves each customer through the funnel  directing them to take specific actions  until they reach the Magic Moment   Remember how Facebook kept telling us to find 10 friends  and kept suggesting friends  It was nudging us towards the Magic Moment  Alex Schultz  VP of Growth at Facebook recounts the whole journey of figuring out the Magic Moment in this awesome talk he gave at YC a few years back   Facebook surely figured it out  and now it is your turn to decide what makes sense for your product and your business   What is YOUR Magic Moment  How will you get your customers there   p s  Special thank you to Laurence Ion for pointing out bugs and inaccuracies in the original post and helping fix them,"[221 1164 1239 881 442 427 549 328 554 1188 484]"
222,training-dataset/product/903.txt,product,Samuel Hulick on building better onboardingSamuel  A lot of times when you ask people what user onboarding is  they ll say that it s something like a tooltip tour  the introductory material or some help documents  While those can be beneficial for getting people up to speed with your product  I really look at it less from a standpoint of dragging people by the ear to activating features or click  next  20 times in a tooltip tour  It s actually more along the lines of getting people up to speed with the better version of themselves they re hoping they will become with your product in your life  It s guiding people toward that up and running  cool and capable stage  It s less a question of getting people from A to B in your app and more from A to B in their lives   Geoffrey  What do you actually define as user onboarding  I know your definition is slightly different than a lot of others   Being in the user experience design field  one area that I noticed could really use a lot more attention was the user onboarding process  or the process of getting people transitioned from being unaware of what your product can provide to them taking on the fullest capability that your product does provide   Samuel Hulick  I started my career as a user experience designer roughly a decade ago  What drew me to that was looking at software as something that can provide superpowers to people  where you have these capabilities that you wouldn t have otherwise   Geoffrey Keating  Samuel  welcome to the show  We ve been huge fans of yours for a long  long time  Can you give us some quick insight into how you started your career and what drew you to onboarding   If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed    Samuel joined me on our podcast to discuss why your onboarding must concentrate on the user over your business  the importance of revisiting your onboarding  where we can find onboarding inspiration outside of the software world  and much more   A UX designer by trade  he is regularly publishing detailed onboarding teardowns of everything from productivity tools like Asana and Trello to Ashley Madison and the Hillary 2016 campaign app  You might also recognize Samuel s name from our new book  Intercom on Onboarding   for which he was a guest contributor  He s written his own book on the topic too   By definition that probably isn t going to happen in one single sitting or within a couple minutes  and would require getting people to come back into your product  A lot of the onboarding centric product designs patterns like tooltip tours can t get people back into your product because they are in your product to begin with  You need to go find people where they are and entice them back in  The two major tools I ve seen to do that are notifications within a mobile app and lifecycle email   Samuel  It s really crucial to have a great first run and sign up experience  The first 5 minutes of your product are really  really important  If you don t make that great first impression  it s very unlikely that they ll come back nearly as willingly as they did before  Nailing that is really paramount  But of course  it s also a matter of building up habits in people s lives and getting them all to be as successful as they possibly can be   Geoffrey  So if it s not just about signing up  how do you build an onboarding to make sure users keep coming back   Targeted  well timed messages are the best way to keep onboarding moving forward  Your onboarding must evolve  Geoffrey  Many of our listeners are at early stage companies and may have only recently designed their onboarding experience  It can be tempting to design an onboarding experience and leave it alone  How often should companies be revisiting their onboarding   Samuel  I ll speak with companies and they ll be excited to say   In Q2 we re going to launch our onboarding   It s always a little something that I wince at  because it sounds like they re treating it as the launch of a discrete feature you can walk away from  They re not necessarily looking at it as an evolving element of product market fit   In the same way that you wouldn t launch customer support and then be done with it  you want to have your user onboarding   especially if you re not looking at it as the definition of some pixels that show up on a screen but rather the process of helping people become successful while adopting your product   to evolve as your market evolves and your product evolves and your customer base evolves  It s something that ideally involves constant iteration and evolution   What onboarding in the real world can teach us about software  Geoffrey  Onboarding in one way or another has been around for hundreds of years  Do you find yourself analyzing onboarding experiences outside of software and in real life  even at the grocery store for example   Samuel  Absolutely  I would say much longer than hundreds of years probably  A lot of times what you re creating when you re creating software is less of a tool and more of an environment for accomplishment or activity  Any time you design an environment it s going to have a natural getting started process where people are figuring out what it is they need to be doing and how   One of the best IRL onboarding examples is when I get out of town and rent a cabin on Airbnb  When I arrive maybe I ll have phone service or maybe not  How easy is it to find where the key is or the key code is located  If I do get in  can I find how to turn on the lights and the heat  Do I know how to access the internet  If it comes with a sauna do I know how to turn that on or not   A lot of times you ll find that the hosts have clearly anticipated all of the questions someone might have upon entering the environment of their house  and everything is laid out right where someone would most intuitively encounter it  Other times it s a complete nightmare  You have to find this one scrap of paper that s hidden underneath a shelf   It s a very similar process where you re looking to transition people into the mode of life that they were hoping to receive when they decided to pull the trigger on  a purchase   Sometimes you can do that really reliably  and sometimes  if you don t pay a lot of attention  it becomes painfully obvious   Geoffrey  That s probably the challenge for some of these on demand companies   some of the variables are out of your control  It s a two sided marketplace  How do companies like Uber  Lyft and Airbnb design around that   Samuel  The design responsibility is as local as the control is  If a host wants to get good ratings and get more people to come and have more positive reviews they can approach it in a conscious  considerate and hospitality oriented way  If they don t decide to do that then they will suffer whatever types of consequences the marketplace determines based off that  I can imagine that being a concern for Uber or Lyft or Airbnb  but at the same time what they re creating is a larger system that hopefully has some self regulation to it   Geoffrey  What can we learn from industries outside of software  Slot machines and video games are two industries well adapted to user onboarding and retention   Samuel  In both cases those have been very influential in my study of onboarding and the research that I have done in my own life  Video games have arguably been around longer than software  at least in the mainstream  and in a lot of ways the getting started experience is a little bit more mature and articulated in that medium  There are things like first level design and tutorials that are part of games and things like that  I ve been able to draw from a really rich pool there in terms of insights and inspiration   Natasha Schull explains how casinos onboard their customers  You mentioned slot machines  There s an amazing book written  about this  by Natasha Dow Schull  Addiction by Design   If you look at casino floor layouts  their climate control  lack of clocks  things like slot machines and even free to play games like Candy Crush  they have really gotten people s brain chemistry figured out and turned addiction to a science  It s regrettable in a lot of ways  as far as the predatory and Machiavellian practices they employ  but at the same time what they re learning can just as easily be used in service of helping people become successful   Ignorance is not something to your benefit  so learning the tools that people who maybe have more questionable ethics are using can be helpful  as long as you re following your own Hippocratic oath   Geoffrey  Particularly in terms of casino design  there s such a fine line between what we can take inspiration from and some dark patterns   Samuel  Speaking personally for myself  I take inspiration from all of it  It s just a question of filtering it through my own litmus test of ethics  That s really the question that I come back to time and time again as a user experience designer  especially when looking at how to persuade and motivate people into taking actions and getting into the field of behavioral economics  If you are really able to have a profound affect on people s behavior and nudge them in one direction or another you re going to need to have some guiding principles around that   Setting up business vs  consumer users  Geoffrey  What types of differences have you noticed in designing onboarding flows for business apps versus consumer apps or consumer products   Samuel  There s less of a difference between the two than one might think upon going into it  The biggest difference is the lifetime value of a customer for business software is typically 10x or more of what the lifetime value of an individual user for something like Twitter would be  Therefore when you re looking to create something that s more consumer oriented you really have to rely on the self serve experience of the product to be able to carry the day  You won t be able to put the resources of people s time or employee time toward going in and helping walk people through in some sort of intimate  white glove kind of way  You may be able to justify that for something that s more B2B oriented  If the lifetime value of a customer is  6 000 or  60 000 you can certainly afford to put an accounts person on that and help walk them through whatever rough edges your user experience might have  At the same time  it s great to have a product that people will crawl through broken glass to get to  but it never hurts to get rid of the broken glass   In both cases if you can have a really intuitive  immersive and  most of all  valuable self serve experience  it s not going to hurt the bottom line   Geoffrey  How does that translate to the enterprise level   Samuel  Enterprise is an interesting beast  I ve worked in that capacity myself  and when the person making the purchasing decision is further removed from the people who are using the product the emphasis on user experience tends to suffer  The bigger the organization and the more the bureaucratic red tape involved  the more you re going to find that the onboarding  experience  is more like golf trips and steak dinners and less about self serve and having a high quality experience for the people that are actually using the product   That can be regrettable in some ways but it also seems to be the fact of the situation  There are a lot of enterprise companies who offer training for their own product and that s actually a revenue center for them  It s almost against their own interest to provide a really compelling product that can explain itself and be used in an intuitive way   Enterprise onboarding  especially for a demo and the long sale cycles  is something that I tend to not focus on much  I focus more on B2B and B2C   Geoffrey  Just to clarify  you re talking about IBM and the Oracle model  where training is often a consultancy and becomes a revenue business in itself   Samuel  Yeah  I haven t looked into that recently  but I would imagine there s some sort of micro economy around providing professional services and things like that  Certainly not to throw any of those companies under the bus  it just seems to be a different model than providing something that people can use on their own   Onboarding in groups  Geoffrey  Traditionally when we think about onboarding we think about one person in front of a computer  At Intercom we re actually having to consider onboarding groups of people  all with different abilities and different roles to play in that onboarding  Have you noticed any good examples of how to onboard groups of people rather than just individuals   Samuel  I don t think that s a particularly new challenge  I would have to imagine back in the Windows 95 days getting people to pick a platform on the OS level or decide whether or not they re going with Microsoft Office was a group decision that involved a lot of employees and people of different hierarchies within the company   The problem is ultimately the same when you re designing B2B  You re probably not designing for a single user  and even if you are  they probably need to be able to make a case to their boss to allocate the budget  or they may need to work with the IT department to make sure it s up to safety standards  They might have to convince their other employees to jump on and work with them in that product  so there s a lot of political maneuvering that may need to take place   It s a people problem just as much as it is a software problem   That s an absolutely huge onboarding opportunity  If you can arm that particular person with some really compelling sales material  then when they do go to their boss and make a case for the budget needs  you re not just relying on them to be the best salesperson they can off the top of their head  You re helping grease the wheels   If you need to onboard an entire team than you need to be really attentive to the different start up modes  If someone wants to start using a bug tracker or a project management tool like Asana  they would probably go in and sign up and be in what I call  homesteader mode   where they re going out in the frontier to set stuff up for other people to follow  Then most likely they ll invite the rest of their team to come in   You really have at least two primary different onboarding experiences  There s the first person who s going in and trying to create an environment of success for everybody else  and then there are the follow on invitation onboarding experiences for people who know substantially less than that first person did and try to make sense of what they re supposed to be doing  why they were invited  what this product is  what it does  what their role in it is  etc  That s absolutely something to pay a lot of attention to   Geoffrey  So one of the challenges is equipping that onboarding champion with enough materials to get everyone else onboard with the particular piece of software   Samuel  Yeah  whether those other people are actually directly using the software or not  One question that I like to walk through as an exercise when I m consulting with companies is   Who does this person care about looking good to  what does looking good look like  and how can we most reliably demonstrate that looking good is taking place for them   It s a people problem just as much as it is a software problem   Where onboarding sits in your company  Geoffrey  Your onboarding teardowns cover all sorts of products from Basecamp to Ashley Madison  What I love about your teardowns is they always start on the marketing landing pages rather than the first few screens after a user signs up  From a organisation structure  where does onboarding sit within a company  Marketing  Product   Samuel  It s tricky  and that s one reason why onboarding can fall through the cracks for a lot of companies  There s something called Conway s Law  The short version of it is basically that the thing a team produces will be organized in way that reflects the way that the team was organized  So if there wasn t anyone who  owns  user onboarding than that will probably be something under emphasized in the end result product that s being created   Onboarding is an incredibly valuable part of the overall product experience  Having someone be in a position to either own that as their full time responsibility makes a lot of sense to me   In regard to starting the onboarding review on the home page or in the marketing material  I really look at that as a cycle  Ultimately if you re onboarding people well you re putting them in a position to succeed or to thrive to the best of their abilities with your product and their life  What you re really hoping to generate is product evangelists who are just getting everything they possibly can out of it and have found such success that they are preaching your name from the mountaintops   Hey  your life could be so much better if you also used product blank    What I really consider onboarding to be is the process of getting people from the first time that they heard that your product could help them all the way to your product actually helping them  That might come through word of mouth  which is a very high ROI approach to customer acquisition  It could also come through a radio ad  a Google or Facebook ad  or SEO  but as soon as your product pops up on someone s radar and they recognize that your product could help them do something better  that s where onboarding really starts  That s where the seeds of what your product promises are starting to be planted   Geoffrey  One of the biggest problems is that you ll often see very inconsistent transitions between marketing pages and the time you sign in  The challenge for a lot of companies is smoothing those transitions between marketing and growth  who might own a different part of the product  and the product team that might own a completely different part  Actually designing a consistent experience that feels completely seamless throughout that onboarding experience is difficult,"[222 709 1282 1214 353 1239 1121 999 405 427 244]"
244,training-dataset/product/293.txt,product,Strategies for onboarding new usersWhen you re building your own onboarding  it s helpful to familiarize yourself with some onboarding best practices   how other companies are signing new users up  how they re demonstrating progress to the user  etc  But what onboarding is right for your product  Everything depends on the type of product you have  Some patterns work fantastically well for consumer apps  but just won t make sense in a B2B product  On top of that  if you have a product with tens or even hundreds of millions of active users  you re going to have to successfully onboard customers from across a wide spectrum of different skills and abilities  Some users don t necessarily want to do the things you need them to do to become successful  You ll need to balance the user experience of onboarding with the friction of necessary steps such as account creation  user education  and data gathering  It s no small challenge  That s why we ve put together a walkthrough of some of the most successful patterns   to explore what patterns work and when  to get you thinking about the right onboarding patterns for your product  1  Social login Social login offers users one click sign up   just create an account with pre existing social profiles like Facebook  Twitter  Google  or LinkedIn  Social login combats one of the biggest issues facing users when they sign up   account fatigue  Social login provider Janrain found 92  of people have left a website instead of resetting or recovering login information  If your goal is any form of virality  social login is a must  Put simply  it increases the rate at which Monthly Unique Users  MUU  are becoming Monthly Authenticated Users  MAU    that means a higher percentage of monthly visitors are actually signing up and logging in  Social login also lets you access and connect to a user s contacts  Instead of asking users to manually input their contacts and build a profile from scratch  leverage the existing network s infrastructure  With some simple API and export features  users can get off to an easy start   One click social login works  But which social login options are right for your app  Much depends on the your product  For example  Facebook is the most popular option across consumer brands  retail  music and media services  For B2B applications  Google is the most popular  So make sure you choose the social login model that best matches your customer base  2  Contextual tutorials All successful consumer products have created habit forming experiences  or so called  desire engines   The more often a user completes these experiences  the more likely they are to  self trigger   You can add these desire engines to your onboarding so users form habits that will keep them coming back to your application  Take Pinterest  Their desire engine is getting users to pin items they find interesting  It would have been easy for Pinterest to force users to click through a step by step onboarding tutorial  But Pinterest doesn t place users into the tutorial immediately  They let you explore at your own pace and wait until the user clicks an image in their content feed  This triggers the tutorial   These types of contextual tutorials give users their first taste of success and kickstart the desire engine so they keep on pinning  It s also important to note Pinterest introduce the concept of pinning and boards  Even when users have successfully pinned an image  they re probably at greater risk of not returning if they don t understand these larger concepts  If your application relies on a new concept without established patterns of behavior  be sure new users don t leave until they understand it  3  Clear path to completion Whether it s numbered steps  a task style checklist  or a progress bar  giving users a sense of how far they have to go to complete the onboarding process helps reduce abandonment  If new users know how many steps they must complete  they re more likely to complete the process  Companies like Spotify  LinkedIn  Facebook  and Intercom all provide numbered steps to preview and track new user s progress through their product s features   4  Early value for the user A simple onboarding flow might give you lots of signups  but lots of signups doesn t always translate to lots of customers  That s why the best products don t stop with an intro tour  They focus on the job the customer is hiring your product for  and show customers how to be successful with it  Twitter is a great example of this  Whether or not a user follows other people on Twitter is an important indicator for user retention  So Twitter encourages you to follow at least 20 other users with a single click to make sure you get the most out of the product  New users are first shown a checklist of topics to choose from  with  popular accounts  already selected  New users that follow people and topics of interest are more likely to continue using Twitter  so they make it easy right from the start  5  Progressive profiling One of the best ways of reducing friction in account creation is allowing users to progressively build their profiles  You do this by requesting only the most important and necessary information during registration  It s a tricky balance to strike  Ask too much of new users and they may not complete the process  Don t ask enough and users are more likely to churn  Requiring just enough information increases the odds of retention   Just enough  information means you won t be giving users the complete experience from your product right away  You can see this tactic in the way LinkedIn  Facebook and Tumblr give users easy opportunities to build their profiles over time   LinkedIn does this by assigning user profiles a strength rating  The rating is displayed on every user profile  with a call to action to  Improve Your Profile Strength   This gives users the chance to complete elements of the profile they left incomplete during their initial onboarding  With each step they complete  users are rewarded with an improved strength rating  As we ll examine later though  progress should be based on what the user wants to do  not what the business wants them to do  6  Connect teams The way software is being bought is changing  and the buyer for a company often starts as an individual user  Collaborative  team based SaaS products like Asana  Dropbox and Slack know the sooner they can connect these individual users to a team the more momentum they build toward a premium upgrade  In each of these examples  when signing up with an email domain others have already used  new users are prompted to connect with teammates on the same domain   Ask to join  and  Find your team  are common ways to encourage users from a company  who may not know their colleagues are considering the same tool  to connect  Slack builds its teammate invitation right into the onboarding flow prior to letting you use the product  In this case  teammates make the tool valuable  With a simple opt in  Slack allows new users to let their teammates join without additional permissions if they ve created an account using a verified company email address,"[244 999 1282 1214 1239 709 348 222 405 427 215]"
322,training-dataset/business/703.txt,business,Ways to increase customer engagementThe definition of an  engaged customer  varies from product to product  For a to do app an engaged user should be logging in every day to add and complete items whereas for an invoicing app an engaged user might only log in once per month  There is no consistent quantifiable definition of engagement across different products  Unlike page views  visitors  returning visitors and conversions  there s also no analytics app that can instantly tell you what you need to know  But ignore engagement at your peril  Just ask Snapchat  Their  20 billion valuation was largely built around almost a whole generation of people signing into their product multiple times every day  Why is user engagement important     Most customers who sign up will use a product only once  This is true for every product with a free trial  This isn t surprising  it s the  Most customers who sign up will use a product only once  This is true for every product with a free trial  This isn t surprising  it s the fallacy of funnels in action  When you strip every barrier away from signing up  what you get is lots of signups  Unfortunately lots of signups doesn t translate to lots of customers  Customers are the result of a series of events  Here is a simple overview     Customer engagement is just one piece of the puzzle  but it is so frequently ignored that there s lots of quick wins to be had  Here s 4 strategies to increase 1  Make a strong first impression Customer engagement is just one piece of the puzzle  but it is so frequently ignored that there s lots of quick wins to be had  Here s 4 strategies to increase customer engagement Every day a potential customer is seeing your interface for the very first time  This can be forgotten within teams that are always designing for themselves  The first screen your users see has 3 important jobs  Explain how your product works  Motivate your users to get started  Let your users know how to get help  if and when they need it  Products that do none of the above get the exact behaviour that they designed for  The user will log out and most likely never return  There are lots of great ways to welcome a new signup to your product and show them around  There are blank slates  tutorials  dummy data  etc  A simple first step that we encourage Intercom customers to do is to send a welcome message to greet each new signup personally  This works great for starting conversations  which in turn increases conversions  Welcoming and engaging new users  All of the data we have says that in app welcome messages are more likely to be read  clicked on  and responded to  which is why we encourage our customers to send them  Some people will just respond with  Thanks   Others will ask how to set up a welcome message  ask questions or spot bugs  Simply communicating with your users is a great way to encourage them to ask questions  try out features  and stick around  By starting a dialogue they re far more likely to say things like  How can I email inactive users   or  How should I use tags    At best you ll win yourself more customers  and at worst you learn what s missing or misunderstood in your product  2  Gradually expose the depth of your product Every worthwhile product has features that aren t immediately apparent or useful  These can include quick wins such as email notifications and alerts  third party integrations  export features and keyboard shortcuts  These deeper benefits can t be called out immediately  After all  who cares about data export before they have data  or keyboard shortcuts before they ve used any features  Most product owners tend to try to expose these features either through badly timed email blasts  documentation  or an FAQ  None of these approaches work well  Emails arrive out of context  out of time  and are more likely to interrupt a user than to interest them  Their response is to archive your message and stop reading future messages  Leaving features explained and promoted in your FAQ or help sections means their only chance of exposure is when a user has experienced an issue with a part of your product  This isn t the ideal time to distract them with other features  Define a message schedule We advise our customers to create message schedules to gradually promote certain features  When you have good insight into your userbase you can work out which secondary features delight users and at what point they re useful  Once you ve done that it s just a matter of timely communication  Intercom lets you send a series of email  push and in app auto messages to people  based on their individual behavior  Each message in the campaign drives people toward a common goal  Always end each message by letting your customers know you re there to help if they have any questions  This is key to getting feedback  which helps you tweak your customer engagement strategy  3  Announce features and improvements in app The only time your users care about new product features or improvements is when they re using your product  so that s exactly where you should be announcing them  In app messages are up to ten times better than email at engaging your customers  For example  when we launched our feature  Smart Campaigns  we announced the new feature to customers when they arrived in the messaging area of Intercom  via an in app announcement  That message contained a video with a high level overview of the feature and instructions to get started   people could click around  test it out and respond with any questions they had  It s hard to imagine an email achieving a similar effect   4  Engage customers during trials,"[322 790 1338 1282 1214 1253 378 215 1239

324,training-dataset/business/741.txt,business,Leslie s Compass  A Framework For Go To Market StrategyFor a moment  simplify the purpose of startup to one act  the transfer of belief  From founder to herself  From founder to startup  From startup to investor  From startup to market  That last transfer of conviction proves to be one of the most tenuous  According to a three year study on startup mortality  most startups fail after having raised  1 3 million and around 20 months after their last financing round  Of course  many factors contribute to those failures  but it goes to show how treacherous of a stretch it can be for startups seeking to pave a path to market   What s needed is a simple test that can bring a go to market strategy into focus   one that can help startups smartly deploy limited resources when a product is first launched and a company has one chance to make a strong  first impression  For these inflection points  startups need a compass  and in my decades of working with them  I think this framework points them in the right direction   The Framework And Its Two Forces  In 2003  a handful of fellow professors and I started lobbying Stanford Graduate School of Business  GSB  to develop a new sales course  The goal of the course would not be geared toward individual salespeople  but how an executive can position a startup to take a product to market  Out of all the professors  the head of the marketing department met me with equal enthusiasm  We locked ourselves away and started designing a course  But  we represented two different domains   marketing and sales   and so we started by asking ourselves   What s the difference between marketing and sales  Why would Stanford GSB teach both    To answer  we went up to the board and drew a diagram like this   This conceptual framework exhibits the interplay between sales and marketing in a go to market strategy  When a product has been commercialized and is available to the public  a company has two key muscles it can flex to take it to market  marketing and sales  Most companies that get this far know this intuitively  But what this chart suggests is that marketing and sales are counterbalances  The less marketing is flexed to bring a product to market  the more sales must step in  If sales is not driving the go to market strategy  the more marketing must  In nearly every case  either marketing or sales takes the lead in getting the product to customers   The challenge is in knowing which one to activate for your company and specific product  This answer is especially critical for startups  which all too often pour resources into both to eliminate the guesswork  even though this wastes a great deal of resources  The stakes are high  If they choose the wrong path  they can stumble out of the gates  For example  hiring a high touch  expensive sales force to sell a low priced product can be a game ender  After this misstep  an otherwise high potential company may fail to grow fast enough to compete or reach profitability   So  at the heart of the framework   and a startup s go to market strategy   is this question   Is your product marketing intensive or sales intensive   To better answer that question  let us examine two extreme examples   Proctor and Gamble s Crest toothpaste and General Electric s jet engines   to illustrate the framework  Key to this chart is the x axis  which has multiple variables to consider that are crucial   but not exhaustive   in hashing out how you should go to market   The first step for startups to take is to determine where they lie on the spectrum by examining the variables  Examine each one and determine whether your product lies on the left  marketing intensive  or right  sales intensive   To determine the answer  ask yourself the following questions about each variable  Let s continue with toothpastes and jet engines  to illustrate the framework   Price is determined by how the customer values the product or service  Simply stated  it s how much is the customer willing to pay  which is tied to the return on investment that the customer realizes  For example  you can t afford to  sell  a  2 tube of toothpaste  To prove it  just take the total cost of the salesman and divide it by the number of sales calls in a year  That s why no one goes door to door saying   Let me explain the benefits of Crest over Colgate   But  say you ve got a product that costs  100 000 to build  you need to sell it for  200 000  Now you re in a sales intensive go to market strategy   Ask yourself  Is this a large or small economic decision for the buyer   Market size is determined by the quantity of potential customers  Products may be saleable to millions or even billions of customers  via smartphones   or only to a very few  For example  billions of people need toothpaste  but unlikely more than 100 airframe manufacturers are in search of a supplier of jet engines   VERITAS  original product was an operating system component that the company sold to systems manufacturers as part of their UNIX operating system  When VERITAS went to market  there were many who wanted to spend money on marketing  But Leslie felt differently  At that time  there were roughly 100 system manufacturers  so spending money on ads or mailing lists didn t make sense  Instead the company invested in going to industry shows   but never bought booths  They knew who the customers were  so sought them out  rather than waiting   Ask yourself  Is it easier for them to find you or for you to find them   When it comes to the level of complexity  some products are dead simple  while others require education  manuals and customization to derive utility  From turbines to subsonic inlets  jet engines are composed of countless components  whereas operating a tube of toothpaste is completely self evident   Another example is Oracle ERP  which can take hundreds of people years to implement  As a complex product  it s always sold  never marketed  Whereas Uber is supremely simple for the consumer  We all remember the first time we opened the app  figured out how to call an Uber and then a little car appeared on the map   Ask yourself  Can a customer self serve to use or is education required   Fit and finish ranges from out of the box solutions to something that requires multiple steps or points of support to operate  As toothpaste literally comes out of the box   or tube   it has a high fit and finish  However  when a jet engine is purchased  that s just the start  it has to interact and interface with other parts of the plane  However  don t mistake complexity with fit and finish   some products that are highly complex have a high fit and finish  For example  a Tesla   or any new car for that matter   has hundreds of computers  but you just need to turn your key or press a button to start it  Regardless fit and finish is key  In most cases  poor fit and finish only has longevity when the customer has no better alternative   Ask yourself  After all is designed  done and shipped  is there still much more for the consumer to do   Identifying whether you re serving a business or consumer is a big component to a go to market strategy  Products are sold to businesses or directly to consumers  Each requires its own type of relationship  But it s key to note that this is a volume metric  There are more consumers than businesses  and the former is more homogeneous than the latter  The vast majority of people need toothpaste  but the vast minority of businesses do not need a jet engine   Ask yourself  Am I predominately selling directly to people or companies   The customer economic lifetime focuses on the cadence and duration of interaction with the customer  Though there is the issue of brand loyalty  there will be hundreds of tubes of toothpaste bought by a customer over her lifetime  Given that jet engines last many years and that there are roughly 100 manufacturers  there are no more than that many deals a year   and likely much fewer  The question is the nature of the relationship with the customer  Do you expect to have a long term relationship with increasing revenue over time  or more transactions with increasing frequency over time  The longer the lifetime of the relationship  the more consideration goes into how I actually deliver and sell this product   Ask yourself  Do I measure successful customer relationships by transactions or longevity   Linked with the customer economic lifetime is whether a product requires high touch or low touch selling  Selling jet engines often requires a  design win   a very long  complex  technical campaign that results in many sales over the years long lifetime of a particular model  It requires relationship building and may be worth billions of dollars over twenty or thirty years  Low touch sales don t require the ability to  land and expand  or customize sales according to the relationship  It takes little history to buy the same or different toothpaste   Ask yourself  How much agency do you have in developing your relationship with your customer  Can your efforts compound or are the mostly one off   In summary  Crest is the extreme example of a marketing intensive product  it s very low cost  bought by millions of consumers  simple to operate and has a high  fit and finish  as it s ready to use immediately after purchase  Though P G would like to have lifetime customers for its toothpaste  it has a very low switching cost and a purchase decision can be influenced by a coupon  Have you ever met a P G sales representative who has extolled the virtues of Crest versus Colgate   On the other hand  the General Electric jet engine typifies the sales intensive product  The engine s price tag is in the millions of dollars  is sold to about 100 airplane manufacturers  has incredibly complicated technology and has low fit and finish  as it always requires extensive engineering and customization after the sale  It s the ultimate selling experience because it s a design win  A customer wants fuel efficiency  strict weight thresholds  thrust  a certain level of noise and hundreds of other specifications  Jet engine manufacturers spend a long time on not only building the products  but defining and fulfilling contracts   it s very high touch  For all these reasons  I ve never seen a GE jet engine offered for sale at Walmart   Mark Leslie  Finding Your Mark  As a conceptual framework  the key is less to identify your company s exact point on the spectrum  but more to know which approach  or in which half of the diagram  your startup is positioned  Depending on whether your new product is more like Crest toothpaste or a GE jet engine will help inform if your go to market strategy should be more marketing intensive or sales intensive   If you re marketing intensive  the product is bought  If it s sales intensive  the product is sold   There are exceptions  but  by and large  how successful a go to market strategy depends on how reasonably aligned each factor is in the same half of the diagram  Here are two companies  stories that illustrate the importance of alignment   Online HR services startup Gusto is an example of good alignment  which led to a successful go to market strategy  Gusto   formerly known as Zenpayroll   operates in a market where tools to run payroll are built for bigger companies  involve heavy duty interfaces and require a bit of a learning curve or support team to troubleshoot   When Gusto decided to offer a solution to many  tiny companies  it had to alter other aspects of how it would go to market  For example  it decided to take a low touch approach and sell its services over the web  While its product is of medium complexity  it has extremely high fit and finish  as it takes only a few minutes to set up and is intuitive to use  Relative to its competitors  its price is low at around  40 per month base price with a nominal per employee fee tacked on  It s technically a B2B company  but where the second  B  is more like a  C  given its many  smaller customers   Today  Gusto now has about 50 000 customers  Here s what its chart looks like   It s important to note that not every checkmark needs to be on one side of the chart for a successful go to market strategy to unfold  However  startups must be aware of the points of misalignment to make adjustments  as Gusto did adjusting its B2B business to a B2C approach given its many  smaller sized customers at the start   In contrast  a cautionary tale is the story of private cloud computing startup Nebula  It seemed to have it all  at least on paper  A co founder who helped start OpenStack  A leadership team that included the man who helped invent the first browser and a former Dell executive  This luminary founding had attracted NASA engineers and backing from top tier investors   After jumping out of the gates with big name customers   such as DreamWorks  Sony and Genentech   and about  1 million in sales the first quarter  the momentum slowed  Nebula hoped and planned for many customers  but  with a  275 000 starter kit  they had a relatively expensive entry level price tag for customers to sign up without a long and arduous sales cycle   Amid the then emerging private cloud computing market and the highly anticipated Openstack movement  potential customers looked for a solution that was as plug and play as Amazon s public cloud offering  Nebula launched as an  all in one appliance   After its early go to market efforts the company realized that its solution required a high level of selling  service  support and education than any off the shelf product could provide   Nebula s sales team targeted businesses  but the product wasn t entirely designed for them  For example  its servers  exotic console   which even displayed Klingon characters   and touchscreen display were intended to excite the technorati  But serious business computing users tucked away servers in dark data centers where few people interacted with the product   Lastly  when Nebula launched  it expected the plug in play solution would not require a high touch  but due to defensive moves by VMWare and the ease of use from AWS  Nebula s sales pitch lost its punch and needed to be ever more personalized and niche to get traction   Nebula never hit its speed and shut down four years after it launched  Here s what it s chart looked like when it launched  orange checkmarks  and what  in retrospect  it should have been  purple checkmarks  as it planned to launch  according to Leslie   Determine Whether Marketing or Sales Takes the Lead  To work through this conceptual framework is not only to increase the likelihood of a more successful go to market strategy  but also to determine how to best structure the relationship between sales and marketing to maintain that momentum   The way to build on an effective go to market strategy is to know whether marketing or sales is taking the lead  If the answers to your questions in your framework   on price  market size  complexity and the others   align toward the left of the chart  marketing should take the lead with the go to market strategy  If the vast majority of the answers align on the right side  sales should take the lead   Sales Serves Marketing  In the scenario on the left  marketing has primacy  In this case  marketing generates the demand  With its campaigns  it creates a strong enough appetite that people buy the product on their own  Sales serves this effort by creating a  place   What this means is that they line up distributors  retailers and merchandiser so the product has a presence   essentially a place where it can be found and is available for purchase  Taking it back to the toothpaste jet engine spectrum  examine the culture of marketing driven Proctor and Gamble  One of the most highly valued jobs   with the greatest upward mobility   is the product manager  who works on the brand  advertising  PR  launch and more   Marketing Serves Sales  In the scenario on the right  sales has primacy  In this mode  marketing s responsibility is to create and hand off qualified leads to the sales organization  They manage various lead sources through an organized pipeline structure  They provide the collateral materials and programs to find prospects  The heart of the organization s success is for the sales department to convert a qualified lead to a customer win   How Primacy Shifts  It s key to note that at the as a company is placed on these axes  the level of primacy   for Marketing or Sales   is most intense at the left and right extreme positions  respectively  As you move toward the middle  the phenomenon of  serving  declines  At the midline  marketing and sales relate as equals   Bringing It All Together  Understanding your go to market strategy as a function of the primacy of sales or marketing is paramount  Use this simple framework to establish whether you have a sales intensive or marketing intensive product that you re bringing to market  Make that determination by pinpointing where your product stands on seven key variables  price  market size  complexity of technology  fit and finish  type of customer  customer lifetime and level of customer engagement  The framework provides a key question to help ascertain where a product stands on each vector  but is more geared to help startups understand whether they are all aligned  If so  not only will that make for a smoother go to market strategy  but also help marketing and sales better coordinate their efforts to win customers   It doesn t matter if you re making toothpaste or jet engines   or anything in between  Any product can be bought or sold with the right alignment and team structure to support it  The questions this framework asks gets to the heart of building great companies and roll up to the most central question  What are we building and for whom  These questions must be asked and answered to be effective for a successful go to market  Of course  there s no one framework that will guarantee victory  but  as the compass needle moves  this one will get you company pointed in the right direction  And that s a competitive advantage in itself   Mark Leslie is a Lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business where

325,training-dataset/product/645.txt,product,How bad features are bornBuilding new features in your product can seem simple at first   But building features that really work for your customers is an incredibly difficult process  and one that requires stepping back from the superficial  Good features come from focusing on the customer and their problem before ever touching a line of code or a pixel of the user interface   How a bad feature begins its life  We ve seen plenty of features progress from inception for the wrong reasons  Here s a common example of how bad features get off the ground   They don t start with the customer  Often  bad features will start from an internal discussion  rather than a genuine customer need   They re perceived as being easy to implement  Sometimes bad features seem easy to implement and on the surface they may look small and focused   They re not designed thoroughly enough  It s easy to draw a screen   the screen that customers will see when this feature is working exactly the way you imagine it to  This is the most obvious piece of the design process  But good features are not born out of designing a single screen   Too many compromises are made in development  If there s a lack of design and thought early on  the development of the feature inevitably suffers  Decisions that would normally come easy and naturally to the engineering team  become challenging because the high level goals and vision for the feature are not clear   What are the warning signs of a bad feature   Bad features cause problems because they re not thought through deeply enough  More often than not bad features start with failing to think about the  Job To Be Done  the customer is hiring you for   It is sometimes possible to build good features without extensive customer research and user testing  but it s generally more difficult  When you rely solely on your instinct and empathy for your customers  sometimes you can get it right  But chances are you won t   Even when you re building something with the best intentions  it s still easy to execute poorly on an idea for a feature  You can forget to design key elements of the user experience that are essential to the product feeling complete   The closer a feature gets to production  the easier it gets to evaluate whether it s a winner or a loser   The announcement of the feature is difficult to write  When there aren t well defined reasons for building the feature nor a clear target audience  it s hard to articulate how it could be valuable and helpful to your customer base   The feature is received by customers with a mediocre response  With an unclear announcement  a muddled development process  and a lack of vision for the feature  the response from customers will most likely be underwhelming  Not only in the audience reaction on social media  but in actual usage   customers don t engage with the feature and they don t see the need for it   When a feature wasn t built for a specific pain point your customers were experiencing  they don t find the need to use it  You ve built a feature for the wrong people  the wrong problem  and the wrong reasons   How to avoid building bad features  Have a clear idea of what job the customer is hiring you for  Most importantly  does this feature deserve to exist  Why are you working on it   If you re embarking on a new feature primarily because you ve seen a competitor release something similar  then you probably haven t thoroughly considered or even identified the problem you re trying to solve  If you re jumping into a new feature because it seems like  it wouldn t be too hard to do  that s great  but does it actually deserve to be built right now   We utilise the  Jobs To Be Done  framework extensively to focus on the problems we re being hired to solve  This means we re building features that form part of a logical workflow that helps our customers  We also use live chat for continuing communication with customers   we regularly ask them questions  but often they approach us requesting changes and improvements that we re always evaluating against our own roadmap   Write a simple explanation of why this feature is valuable to the customer  Amazon famously writes their press releases for new products before they start working on them  We ve always found this to be a helpful process to go through before embarking on building new features   write at least a few sentences to outline why customers will benefit from the work you re doing   Aside from helping with the product development process  writing the press release first helps with the marketing and sales when the feature finally hits production   Design the screen before and the screen after  Most features are part of a flow  Rarely is there just one static screen to design  Run through the feature step by step to find out how you arrive at the feature  what happens when you interact with it  and where the user goes after they ve used the feature   Using a prototyping tool like Marvel helps encourage you to think about how the feature fits into a flow   you have to design the interaction and go beyond just a static screen   Design the empty state  It s easy to think of a feature in use with all the data and information in the screen when everything s fully set up  But many users never get to your  dream  state   they ll likely see the feature when it s not yet being used  Have you thought about the feature when it s not being used  Designing the empty state of a feature can help encourage users to interact with the feature in the first place   Design the error state  Things don t always go to plan  Considering what happens to a feature when an API is throwing an error or when the user s internet goes offline helps ensure the feature feels solid and reliable   It s easy to forget the error states when designing in a protective environment  like on a local machine with super fast wired network access   but when your product is used in the real world real problems happen  It s easy for an entire product to start feeling brittle and fragile if you don t consider error states and fallbacks   Good features start with problems  If there s one sure fire way to spot a bad feature  it s when the value to customers isn t immediately obvious  Whenever you re struggling to explain why a new feature is going to help your customers  stop and run through these points to check you re not building for the wrong reasons   Good luck  go build something great,"[325 1282 1214 1253 1142 1224 328 807 322 1263 1364]"
328,training-dataset/business/419.txt,business,Who are you building for As a company scales it s easy for teams to lose sight of who they re building for  With siloed teams and a lack of communication  customer empathy becomes so diluted that it s just another poster on the wall  But for today s software companies  customer support teams can keep everyone intimately connected to the problem you re solving  Provided they re set up in the right way  they can make sure the right kind of features are on your roadmap  and the right kind of insights are driving your research team  At the Berlin stop of our Inside Intercom World Tour  I recently discussed how to scale a company while keeping customer experience at its heart  Prefer a written account  You ll find a written version of my talk below  A world of asynchronous communication Imagine a successful and growing company  If you asked the founder of that company who they re building for  they ll be able to answer you quickly and concisely  That s because the genesis of a new product always involves solving some problem better or more cheaply than ever before  Good solutions require an intimate understanding of the problem you re solving  but perhaps more importantly  the people that you re actually solving it for  What would happen if you ask an engineer at that same company who they were building it for  Would they have the same answer  How about a few of the company s customers  If you told them the founder s answer  would those customers agree with that answer or would they laugh in your face  I think this simple example highlights the question that s at the heart of scaling a successful business today   how do you build a company where every employee remains intimately connected to both the problem you re solving  but more importantly  to the customers that you re solving it for   Let s take a step back to ask why we even have to ask a question like this in the first place  In the past  nearly all businesses were small  Most  in fact  were run by just a single family  and you learned the business  its mission and its values because you grew up immersed in it  You knew your customers really well because they were your friends and your neighbors   Even after industrialization moved us into offices  we still used asynchronous communication methods to do business  either seeing each other face to face and shaking hands or using the phone  But the internet changed everything  Suddenly  you could market and sell to millions at one end  and receive support requests or questions from tens of thousands of people on the other  asynchronously and completely independent of the time of day or day of the week   It s not that businesses intentionally set out to forget that customers matter  It s just that we somehow tricked ourselves into thinking that we could operate differently at internet scale than we have for millennia at human scale  We somehow forgot that without any customers  we don t have a business in the first place  The products we build exist to solve specific problems  They exist to make our customers  lives easier or more enjoyable  But how do you begin to do that in a really human way at internet scale  For me  it starts with customer experience  Customer experience   perception  product   people I define customer experience in 3 key components   perception  product  and people  Perception is all about how your current and potential customers perceive your company and your brand  With your potential customers  as they move closer to signing up to your actual product  those perceptions will become expectations  With your current customers  the way you operate and the way you do business will determine whether you re building an army of evangelists for your brand or an army of detractors  For product  ask yourself the following questions  How does it feel to actually use your product   Is it simple or is it complex   Is it an uphill battle or is it effortless   Does it even solve the problem that you ve set out to solve in the first place  And for people  ask yourself the following  Are the interactions your customers having with your team productive   Can you communicate personally and concisely   Can you fix issues quickly   Can you actually take feedback from customers and use it in an effective way  A bad product supported well is a really bad customer experience  No amount of lipstick is going to make your pig fly  I think that s pretty clear to all of us  But a good product supported badly is still a bad customer experience  It s impossible to separate our expectations and the people we interact with from the actual product itself  In short  your support team gets to define how good or bad people think your product is  Bridging the gap Jeff Bezos once said   The best customer service is if the customer doesn t need to call you  doesn t need to talk to you  It just works   Of course  this describes a state you re never going to reach  But it s our job to try to bridge the gap between our current reality and the one that Jeff envisioned for Amazon  It s incredibly important to understand you re never going to arrive at a place where none of your customers reach out to you and nor would you want to  You have to think of it more as a practice  one where you re applying constant gentle pressure towards continuously improving your product based on your customers  feedback     Where do you begin  No matter what stage your company is at  it s critical you build a tightly coupled feedback loop that ensures feedback from your customers is getting to the people that actually build and support your product  Where do you begin  No matter what stage your company is at  it s critical you build a tightly coupled feedback loop that ensures feedback from your customers is getting to the people that actually build and support your product  In the early days of a startup  product support and research are generally done by one or just a few people  usually the founders  But by necessity  as you grow your product and your business  you re going to have to separate these into different teams  Even with the best intentions  a lot of times growth means siloed teams with a fundamental lack of communication  To counteract this silo effect  it s critical you have processes in place that force people to color outside the lines of their specific area of the organization  Product can t be allowed to live in an ivory tower  building whatever strikes their fancy  Your customer support team has to cultivate the long view and really understand that your product vision is built one iteration at a time and not compiled of a jumble of customer anecdotes  Your research team needs to be the glue that binds these two teams together and funnels all that great customer data from your customer support team into actionable insights for your product team  Product meet support How do you ensure the product team is being continually brought back to your customers in a way that isn t just academic  At Intercom we use something called Customer Day  The idea is simple  Designers  engineers  or product managers put down your normal tools and join the customer support team on the frontline for a day  It s been an eye opening way to keep the product team  but also every other team in the company  connected to our customers  What s most important is that everyone that does a Customer Day is forced to interact directly with our customers  Whether it s a little hit of dopamine you get when you close a successful conversation or the raw  painful experience of having to deal with an angry customer  I really feel strongly that the Customer Day program has led to a much more balanced roadmap  better designs  and much more careful coding  A high performing support team can only exist within the fabric of your product  Without a fundamental understanding of the problem you re trying to solve  and a framework they can use to dig in the customer feedback  it s really easy for a customer support team  and especially one at a fast growing company  to become apologists  Applying Jobs to be Done to customer support Peter Drucker famously said   The customer rarely buys what the business thinks it sells him   He goes on to be much more explicit and says   One reason for this is that nobody actually pays for a product  What is paid for is satisfaction   On the support team at Intercom  we use the Jobs to be Done framework to help us discover what it is our customers are trying to use our product to actually do  In effect  we re trying to create that satisfaction that Drucker talks about  The Jobs to be Done framework is a way of thinking about exactly that   the jobs a customer is trying to use your product to achieve  In a nutshell  it s the idea that a to do list app on your iPhone and a Post It note are actually competing products  Both exist to help you remember to do something you need to do  We spend a lot of time and energy hiring these insatiably curious people that are very product minded for our support team  But we then doubled down on that by starting with Jobs to be Done from the very  very beginning and relating that to every area of our product as they deepen their knowledge  The result is really powerful  It gives everybody a lens through which they can think about the questions they re going to ask customers and ensure they are asking the right ones  But it also allows them to unpack and clearly articulate what are the underlying motivations customers have in using our products  Acting on customer insights Let s say you ve hired a great support team and they re now producing mountains of raw data from all of the conversations they re having with your customers  But how do you actually generate key insights out of thousands or tens of thousands of conversations  A solid qualitative research team is the key to weaponizing this data  At Intercom the support team uses tags to categorize both the type of question asked  but also what area of the product it relates to  Our research team then further refines these groupings using the Jobs to be Done framework,"[328 1247 1014 1026 756 549 32 1058 888 502 494]"

it s easy to find lists of tips and tactics  It s much harder to put together a strategy you can return to time and again   Every product is different  of course  There s not a one size fits all approach  But we do have common methodologies for framing questions and answering them  for figuring out what s interesting in your data  experimenting  learning  and growing   Amplitude has taken these best practices from across the industry and collected them in The Product Analytics Playbook  The first volume of the Product Analytics Playbook  Mastering Retention  is released today   We decided to focus on retention as our first topic because it s the most critical metric for the success of a business  yet it s often overlooked in favor of acquisition rate  installs  or daily active users  Here are our big findings   1  Retention is Different at Every Stage of the User Lifecycle  Too many companies focus only on retaining their new users  But only a percentage of users at any given time can really be said to be  new   You can t just think about new users when you have so many who have been using your product for three days  a week  two and a half months  and so on  Each one of those groups has different needs and is in a different context with your product   There are   New users  Users you ve just acquired  Current users   Users who have been using your product for a defined period of time  Resurrected users  Users who became inactive and have returned to your product and become active again  Looking at your user base through the lens of a retention lifecycle means using tactics specific to each group in an attempt to bring all users into an active  current state   You want to activate your new users  Reactivate your resurrected users  And turn your current users into extra engaged power users  Current user and resurrected user retention are both high leverage ways to understand your users better and increase your overall retention   In mobile gaming  there s a word for power users whales  Whales  despite being generally very few in number  account for something in the order of 70  of all spending on in app purchases  Now think about how silly it would be if mobile game developers sought only to  activate  new users and devoted no resources to creating more of these whale gamers  That s the power of focusing on current user retention   It s the same with resurrected user retention  It might seem odd to focus attention towards helping churned users come back and get value out of a product  but do it right and it can be a serious driver of success  Evernote is famous for doing this to particularly brilliant effect   Users re download the app every time they switch devices  producing a  smile  effect as they re reactivated  With a large number of users  this can be a huge driver of revenue   Resurrected user retention  current user retention  and new user retention are all important  It s just that the tactics you use to approach them will be different   2  You Need a Strategy Organized by Behavioral Persona  Looking at your user base in terms of the entire lifecycle forces you to understand that each segment has different goals and different needs  Each responds to a different kind of motivation and nudging   When you plan out your product development  you should prioritize features and fixes according to the group of users you re trying to target   But current  new  and resurrected aren t the only ways to segment out your users  You should also segment based on behavior in your product  Behavioral personas organize users into groups based on how they tend to use your product  If we take YouTube as an example  we can identify three distinct groups quite easily   Viewers  Creators  Viewers   Commenters  Each one of these groups has different needs too  and YouTube has to decide which group is most valuable and important in order properly to prioritize product development   You probably have different ideas about which behavioral personas are the most important at different stages of a company s growth  In the early years of Facebook  the most important users may have been those that invited the most of their friends the product s greatest vectors for virality  Today  the most important users may be those that share the most content those who create the engaging Newsfeed experiences that maintain the product s growth   Whoever your most valuable users are  you need to amplify their behavior  It s about understanding the value that people derive from your product and capitalizing on it   3  Retention is not What you Think it is  What is an  active user    Is it someone who opens your app  or is it someone who opens your app and takes a specific action  or a specific set of actions  Without a meaningful definition  your daily monthly active user metric is nothing more than a stock vanity metric   This is why it s important that you go beyond mere activity and define what we call your app s critical event  This is the core activity of your app the tweeting  the posting  the listening  etc  that marks real usage  Calculating your DAU MAU through your critical event metric will give you a real time feedback loop on how well you re doing at driving engagement with your product   That s not the only thing to consider when it comes to tooling  You also need to work out which of the three major methods you should use to calculate your retention in the first place   Unbounded   Shows you what percentage of users come back on a particular day or later  N day   Shows you what percentage of users come back on a particular day  Bracket   Shows you what percentage of users come back within certain preset time brackets  For a grocery delivery app with hefty minimums and big average order sizes  you wouldn t necessarily expect users to be coming back more than biweekly to place orders  The fact that users open your app once a day is interesting but likely not really meaningful for your company s success   A social app that relies on a constant flow of new content  however  cannot survive if its users are only coming back every two weeks to post updates  It needs to be an integrated  daily part of its users  lives  Even if they open it a lot  it doesn t matter unless they re actually participating and therefore making the experience valuable for others   The method you choose to measure your retention with needs to align either with your product s natural usage or with what you hope that usage will become  You need to look at critical event and current usage patterns to find your product usage interval  whether that s daily  weekly  or monthly then you can measure retention in a meaningful way to track improvements to your product   Without retention  your product is a leaky bucket  you can pour in as many dollars as you like into marketing  advertising  and other means of user acquisition  and still wind up with no long term users which means no sustainable growth and no means to generate revenue   There are thousands of articles listing  growth hacks  for increasing retention  ranging from social media tactics  to drip campaigns  targeted ads  and push notifications  The problem with most of these tactics is that they re just that  short term  often unspecific  tactics that lead to a transient uptick in active users  To date  we haven t had a broadly applicable framework for improving user retention at various stages of the user lifecycle   The Product Analytics Playbook aims to fill this gap  We developed the frameworks in the book through conversations with retention experts and our experience working with some of the leading product and growth teams in the industry   and we ve validated the methods by applying them to real web and mobile products from different verticals  We ve also partnered with some of the best companies in the product world to help us present the chapters of the playbook  including   mParticle   customer data control  segmentation  and enrichment  ProdPad   product management  roadmapping and backlog software  MindTheProduct   50 000  member international product community  ConversionXL   conversion rate optimization consulting and training  Adjust   in app analytics  advertising attribution and app store statistics  Appboy   multichannel app lifecycle marketing  messaging  and metrics  Through eight chapters  this volume of the Product Analytics Playbook will teach you   The basics of retention  and why it s so important no matter what kind of business you re running or customers you re selling to How to identify your product s critical event  or core value proposition The Retention Lifecycle Framework and how to apply it to your own product The product analysis toolkit  a collection of methods and analyses for understanding user behavior Why current user retention matters  and how to learn from your most successful current users to boost overall retention How to effectively onboard and retain brand new users How to bring back resurrected users and keep them retained long term How to prioritize experiments and apply everything you ve learned into a cohesive retention strategy  This isn t about  growth hacking   It s about giving you strategies that you can put in place for products in all industries and at all stages of growth   The Product Analytics Playbook  which we prepared over the course of 2016  clocks in at 155 pages  We re excited to share it with you  which is why if you re one of the first 25 to request a

365,training-dataset/business/97.txt,business,ClassPass  CMO on How and When to Invest in Product MarketingIt s the stuff that keeps CMOs up at night  the time had come to sunset a beloved product  and customers were going to care  A lot  It wasn t a question of whether there would be press  but how rough it would be  And social media was about to light up with the news   That very scenario recently played out for ClassPass CMO Joanna Lord   and she couldn t be more grateful   The fitness startup phased out its unlimited membership option  a disappointing decision for the company and its users alike  But it gave Lord and her team a chance to double down on what product marketers do best  they spent nearly a month preparing for every question and comment  every tweet and customer service call  Internally  they huddled with product  marketing  sales and CX to devise new product offerings that would satisfy   delight  even   the affected users  And in the end  ClassPass emerged with both a more sustainable product offering and a deeper understanding of what its users wanted   For Lord  the only way forward is to fall in love with one process  getting in the mind of your customer  Do that  and even the most public marketing challenge is just an opportunity to make your product better  your team more focused and your users more happy  That tack has served Lord at Classpass  as well as VP of Marketing at home services platform Porch  CMO of loyalty software provider BigDoor and VP of Growth at Moz  previously SEOmoz   an inbound analytics software company   In this exclusive interview  Lord clarifies what product marketing really is  and why founders should consider investing in it sooner rather than later  She shares tactical advice for recruiting  integrating  and establishing the culture of a top notch product marketing team  And she explains why an organization that puts the customer first  in all things  is wielding a little bit of magic   What Product Marketing Is   and Isn t   Product marketing  at its heart  is about understanding what you re building  why you invested in it  and how it will benefit the user   and then messaging that understanding to your customer   says Lord  But if you re not sure how product marketing is different than  marketing marketing   you re not alone   Lord observes that many people primitively define product marketing as the ability to position  but she believes it s so much more than that  She sees the field as an amalgamation of four key tasks  It s helping a company determine   What to build  which typically overlaps with product   Who to build for  which typically overlaps with UX  or business development sales   How to price it  which typically overlap with pricing  marketing  product  or sales   And how to sell it  which overlaps with marketing and sales    Whereas marketing is traditionally about leveraging channels to drive prospects or leads   to get people at the top of the funnel and then move them through it   product marketing is more about helping existing customers understand your products and features and engage with them   Done well  of course  product marketing will drive new users  too  But it s primarily an exercise in communicating with your customers  and helping them understand the full value of everything you build for them   When to Kick start Product Marketing  Because product marketing is fundamentally cross functional  it can be difficult for startups to know when  and how  to integrate it  If you re wondering whether it s time  consider two key questions   How big is your company   How complex is your product portfolio   In a smaller company  it s easier to get customer service  product  marketing and sales on the same page about your products  features and why they re valuable   If you have one product  and it s super early for the company  you could even have someone on your product team  or your marketing team  playing this role 50  of the time   says Lord   Really small early stage start ups might not need a product marketer  because their CEO is the product marketer    On the other axis is your product portfolio  If your products are complicated  think about investing in product marketing early  even if you re a small company   A product or feature can be complicated for many reasons  it might involve a new UX concept  the pricing might scale with usage or it may entail an upfront commitment from the user before it s fully unlocked   says Lord    At ClassPass  we launched our new Home experience for our mobile customers  Its entirely new navigation involved personalized suggestions  upcoming class information and their favorite classes   says Lord   This was a significant shift from our previous  schedule based  interface  We wanted this new experience to convey our commitment to creating a seamless  personalized fitness membership  but that isn t easy to relay in a few touch points    So if you re too close to the product and can t tell if your product or upcoming feature release is complicated  ask yourself these questions   Does this feel like an evolution or a revolution to the current experience   Are you trying to convey a greater shift in strategy or mission with this release   How easy could a customer explain the product or feature to another customer   If you launched this product or feature with absolutely no support or product tips  how easy would it be to understand   Lastly  if you asked your internal teams to explain it to the customer  would they all pitch it intuitively the same way    By asking these questions  you ll see pretty quickly that what feels simple to the teams closest to the product could easily leave the customer confused without the right product marketing strategy behind it   says Lord   After assessing the size of your company and complexity of your product portfolio  you ll land somewhere on this matrix   It s not a question of if you ll need product marketing  but when  As your company matures   as it either grows in size or develops a more complicated product portfolio   the need for someone to focus on messaging and positioning will become clear   You need to have achieved product market fit  of course  Until then  you re still throwing things up against the wall  waiting to see there s really demand for one of your products   says Lord   Beyond that  though  I believe in investing in this early    Product marketing essentially lies between product management and development on one side  and acquisition and retention on the other  As such  product marketers own a number of crucial tasks that otherwise fall into a sort of no man s land  Top among them is competitive research  product marketing is also typically responsible for creating a number of crucial definitions  facts  and taxonomy docs for the company   If you re stitching together value statements to drop into a launch email  it s time to build out product marketing   How to Hire for the Right Skill Set  It s a special hire who can sit at that intersection of building great products and messaging them into the public consciousness  When it s time to invest in a product marketing team  you need to look for a particular combination of hard and soft skills    As you might expect  I ve found that the best product marketers have a combination of marketing and product chops   says Lord  Candidates need to be well versed in topics that don t necessarily fit neatly in a single discipline  ideation  agile development  launching releases  go to market and demand generation  for example  Lord s most successful hires have often started in product and found themselves drawn to marketing   or vice versa   What you re looking for is a respect for both disciplines  Product marketing is not either or  It s absolutely both   she says   Beyond subject matter expertise  there are a few key traits that should be non negotiable when searching for a stellar product marketer   Drawn to details  Product marketing involves a lot of minutiae  and candidates need to manage it all  Keep an eye out for a project management background when you re reviewing resumes  In Lord s experience  a lot of great product marketers come from that world  too   Researches by default   Product marketers have to be data driven and love research  They re spending a lot of their time understanding the market  and helping the company understand how to position itself   says Lord  In person or UX research chops  and more traditional data experience  can be helpful   Fetches feedback  Your product marketers are a voice for your users  and they need to be excited by the challenge of getting into the customer s mindset   They have to have that deep respect for CX and feedback  They have to want to develop something that really serves the customer   says Lord   Identifies as cross functional  Few roles touch more people in your organization than product marketing   Candidates really need to have strong self awareness  but also relationship awareness   If someone can t collaborate well across departments and functions  they won t be able to do the job   It s a lot to look for  but Lord shared some of her favorite interview questions for digging deeper into a candidate s qualifications   What is product marketing  What s your framework for approaching product marketing   The number one thing they need to be able to do is show me a great go to market strategy   she says   That should typically include a checklist that crosses teams  and tasks to be executed before  during  and after release    How do you measure the success of a go to market  Look for specifics here  The answer might focus on driving awareness or adoption  for example  or increasing retention  But whatever the framework  it should have its roots in measurable data   There s a domain to this  There s deep knowledge   says Lord   When someone says   I just love product  I love to help customers understand great products   that s too soft for me    How do you handle ambiguity  How do you handle quick timelines  How do you transfer knowledge through organizations  There are crucial soft skills to product marketing too  though  Leave room in your interview to suss out how the candidate would manage the pressures of startup life or the inevitable challenges of coordinating large numbers of busy colleagues   You may also want to consider a homework assignment  particularly if you re interviewing candidates who have only  unofficial  expertise on one side of the product marketing spectrum   that is  who ve held roles in either marketing or product  but don t have verifiable experience in both   Lord shared a couple of her go to exercises   Here s a made up product  How would you approach defining and positioning it for the market   You re actually looking for them to come back with the questions they would ask   Here are the questions I d ask product  Here are the questions I d ask the executive team  Here are the questions I d ask customers in the focus group     We have this real world product  People are turning off of it quickly  How would we get to the heart of why  In this case  you want candidates to demonstrate that they know how to link all the feedback channels across the company  Moreover  you want them to prove that they re scrappy   They should show you that they understand cancellation surveys  or would put up an on site survey to understand why people bounce  That they would talk to CX to see what they believe is causing the problem  or interview the sales team  which is probably the number one source for understanding friction in the selling process   says Lord   The Fine Art of Launching Product Marketing  Once you ve found the right person   or people   for the job  it s time to integrate them with the rest of your team  Particularly when it comes to onboarding your first product marketer  proceed thoughtfully   there s actually more of an art to it than you might realize   The number one mistake I see is failing to make sure that product managers and marketing managers have a shared definition of what product marketing is    It doesn t matter who you hire  If a product manager feels like someone else is defining their product  or a channel marketer feels that some other person is telling them how to sell  it will fail   says Lord   Sales and CX  too  can feel like their toes are being stepped on when a new function begins to tell them how to talk to the customer  From the get go  though  Lord makes it clear to her marketing orgs that those departments are both their most valuable source of information and their most vulnerable stakeholders   Nothing is closer to the heart of customer confusion than the CX team   she says   We respect that if we fail to do our jobs  they will feel it    Standing up a product marketing organization is an enormous boon for a startup  When customer facing teams can easily share insights with product  and vice versa  the entire company gets on the same page  In many ways  it s a chance to recapture the uniquely collaborative energy of a startup s earliest days   only this time  with a new depth of expertise and process   But if people don t have the same understanding of what s supposed to happen  you end up with a lot of territory grabbing and silo making  For all of the obvious reasons  that s really scary    A successful product marketing organization  then  needs a clear mandate and company wide consensus  Like many other elements of the organization  it also needs a steady  coherent product roadmap    If you bring in a product marketer because you have a great product  but you don t know what you re going to build next  or when or how  this person has nothing to stand on   says Lord   They become a bit more of a project manager at that point  And that s a very expensive project manager    Of course  product marketers themselves also play a crucial role is proving their worth and establishing a team that the rest of the organization respects and values  In Lord s experience  that boils down to open  humble communication   The product marketer has to be an expert at asking questions and understanding both the customer and their internal stakeholder   she says   Making assumptions  on the other hand  is the quickest way to lose internal buy in  And it s an easy mistake to make  Product marketers handle huge amounts of information  both qualitative and quantitative  in many ways  it s only natural to form opinions   If they re prescriptive rather than objective  that s really dangerous  It never works  It tends to  again  cause silos    The key to great product marketing is to remain two things  objective and a team player   Unleash Product Marketing Via Experimentation  One of the best ways to do both is to swap opinions for data driven analysis  In addition to fostering cross departmental collaboration  product marketing teams can and should usher in a culture of experimentation    Product marketing comes down to how you position and message a feature or product   says Lord   Doing that excellently involves a lot of testing   For starters  make A B testing standard practice  with testing software now so affordable  there s no reason not to   Being able to swap out positioning quickly is a huge part of getting signals back  It can help you move quicker and with more confidence    Beyond that  there s no single experiment every startup to run  no rule for how to approach testing  that depends too much on your company s roadmap and relative maturity  But every startup does need to weigh the three key ways to grow a company  acquisition  retention  and monetization  And if you re like most startups  there s a good chance you re weighing them wrong    Most startups over invest in acquisition testing  when they should be researching   and using most of their product marketing team   to understand and affect retention    Another common testing pitfall  Asking questions that are too broad to yield precise  actionable insights   What do you want us to build   or  What s the number one problem you have   The big picture questions you might ask on the road to product market fit are not the same questions you should be asking when it s time to scale  and beyond   Take a common problem Lord sees with cancellation surveys   Many of them are fundamentally flawed because they allow you to answer with something like   I just didn t see the value  or  I just didn t like it    she says   Bring that back to the team  and you ll still be in a dark room shooting darts at all the walls  with no idea what you re doing    To avoid spinning your wheels   and wasting valuable customer time   always be specific in your tests  The rigors of experimentation may bump up against the startup s need for speed  but resist the temptation to rush it  Process is crucial  Identify your thesis and specific goal  the cohort you will be testing against  and how you will execute your test  Then meet regularly with the group that s contributing to the experiment to assess the test itself   The team at ClassPass  for example  believes that the company has something unique to offer in video fitness  They are committed to making product investments in that arena   and to taking the time to make and test hypotheses for what those investments should look like   We re not quite sure what our contribution in this space will be yet  But we have conviction to test our way into it    How Product Marketing Can Usher In a Culture of Product Feedback  Successful product marketing can t exist in a vacuum  though  It requires a commitment from everyone else in the organization to share their insights and be a voice for the customer when the opportunity arises  To start  that might be as simple as requiring every team to send out a weekly report of key findings  test results for the data driven teams  or a summary of the week s highlights and lowlights for teams whose work is more qualitative   You re just trying to bring knowledge  and bring an experimentation first culture   says Lord   But  sharing  means more than disseminating test results  it needs to be part of your company culture   Anyone can walk up to our CPO with an idea or say   This test is showing me X and Y  Who should I connect with on your team to talk about whether or not this could become a feature or a product    It s okay to put parameters on that openness  At ClassPass  a test has to demonstrate that something could yield 1 000 subscribers before it s considered for product development  The goal is simply to empower any team member to spot and share opportunities to improve products   By encouraging an open discussion of ideas  you also  perhaps counter intuitively  make it easier for your team to move on when their ideas don t make it into the pipeline  Lord says the ClassPass encourages a culture of  disagree and commit  and she suggests other startups do the same    Every quarter we do our planning sprints  and anyone can bring their idea and a business case for why it s worthy of investment   she says   When faced with pushback  you can take a last chance to disagree and say   I really think this is the right thing  Look at all those tests I ran   But then if the CPO or product leads look at you and says   I hear you  But now s not the right time   you have to accept that and rally behind the ideas that do move forward    That s not to say it s easy to move on   You are going to have about a thousand things you want to do every day   says Lord   And of those thousand  probably twenty are things that customers  with pain in their eyes  have implored you to tackle  But the reality is that some of them will have to go untouched    And that s okay   as long as you stay customer first   You have to take bigger swings  The right things will hit volume  so you re looking for the ones that will hit the majority of people   says Lord   Those will start to trickle down    Meanwhile  give a loud internal voice to the team that is closest to your users  customer support  This should take the form of an ongoing and open dialogue  but it can also include one off collaborative events   Recently  we did what we called a  slay day   where the entire company supported CX and jumped in to work on help tickets and get them to inbox zero   says Lord   It s one of the best thing we ve ever done  Engineers  product managers  and marketing all came out of that day obsessed with solving problems for the customer    Host a  slay day  where all teams help CX get to inbox zero  Everyone finishes the day obsessed with solving issues for customers   How to Measure Success for Product Marketing  How do you know  though  if you re actually reaching that customer  Lord brings it back to those four key elements of product marketing  each of which has its own set of metrics   What to build  Here  you ll want to look at product engagement metrics  which are what you might imagine  log ins  usage stats  sales figures   Who to build for  This one often comes down to your customer feedback loop  cancellation surveys  funnel conversion rates  And pay particular attention to your activation metrics   That early life reporting is very important  That will tell you if you re bringing in the right people  and if you re building products for those people    How to price it   Pricing is probably the most challenging for a product marketer to help understand   says Lord   It comes down to surveying and customer research  It s finding out from the customer  When you say this isn t a good value  or it s not the right price  what does that mean to you     How to sell it  This is the most marketing oriented task of the product marketer  and it can be measured with traditional acquisition metrics   click through and conversion rates  customer acquisition costs  funnel conversion rates   and the feedback loops you have with CX or sales    Every dimension of product marketing is measured a different way  but it s absolutely a measurable science    That being said  you won t   and frankly can t   give all of those metrics equal attention at every stage of your growth   There s always a more important part of product marketing at any given time   says Lord   If you re just past product market fit and focused on growth  then you re looking at how to sell your product and who you re building for  Those metrics move to the top  If you re in a more sustainable business phase  and you want to boost LTV or RPU  then you re really looking at how you should price it  What are the other features you re going to build  for stickiness    Here  too  sharing is key  If everyone on the team doesn t know the top level goals you re pursuing  and which metrics have risen to the top  you will always fall short of your peak performance   People laugh about putting dashboards up on walls  But if you don t make those metrics visible all the time  if everyone doesn t know  every day  how you re doing  then they won t be reminded of the urgency  And that s a huge part of the culture of data    How to Keep Product Marketing Delivering Through Thick and Thin  The collaborative  data driven culture of a well integrated product marketing function will pay dividends every day  And when it comes time to weather a seismic product shift  it ll prove invaluable  Lord has led her fair share of product marketing teams through trials and tribulations   these tenets helped them stay the course   Hew to your mission   First and foremost  you have to be able to tie major product changes back to the mission in a very true and honest and vulnerable way  You need to explain how this change is helping you deliver on your promise to the customer   says Lord  Take ClassPass  move to eliminate unlimited memberships  at its root  that decision reflected a fundamental misalignment between the product and the company s mission   Our mission is to make the world a more active place  For that product to be financially viable  we had to actually hope people didn t work out    Communicate thoughtfully   and thoroughly  Once you ve spotted misalignment  and identified the product shift that will solve it  the next job of the product marketer is to walk customers through your logic  Then  you need to tell them where you re going next   Show them what you are going to be building  and help them make the cognitive leap to come along  Some won t  but if you do it right  many will   says Lord   In a nutshell  successfully marketing a major product change is an exercise in painstaking communication  It falls to product marketing to arm every team with any message they need  done carefully and clearly    For ClassPass s recent change  Lord and her team spent weeks interviewing and brainstorming with all of their internal stakeholders  They imagined every possible question and objection they d get   from customers  partners  press  and more   then drafted responses suitable for anything from Twitter to a sales call   It took twenty full working days  with thirty people   says Lord   We were over prepared  but that s what you do when you know customers deserve the right answer  You don t get to be vague  you don t get to lie  you don t get to spin it  You ve got to lean into it and do it really well    Otherwise  it s easy move quickly and not think rigorously   and this is typically not done maliciously  You simply imagine how a big announcement is going to play out publicly  and there s an instinct to rationalize your decision  But that s where a culture of open ideas sharing   that  disagree and commit  policy   can bail you out   It s why checks and balances are so important   says Lord   Someone from CX will step up to me and say   Absolutely not  I cannot say that to a customer with a straight face  That is not true   There s a lot of back and forth    Diligence takes time  and a lot of internal resources  so it s crucial to set the right expectations for your team  And remember  this is probably disappointing for them  too   it s rough to spend months  even years  building something only to see it phased out   You have to honestly say   Hey  this won t be an hour where we send an email and it s hard  This is going to be three months of catching up with CX and handling press inquiries  and earning back some of that goodwill     Return to the product  The best way to regain that trust and goodwill is always going to be with your product  If you ve done step one right   if you ve kept your eye on your mission   this is also where you can also restore your team s passion and enthusiasm during a difficult transition    We tried so many different things   for two years   to make unlimited work  What we ve been able to say to the team over the last couple months is   If we can move the right people to the right plan  and then invest in those plans beautifully  we will have delivered on the promise we initially set   Now  everyone s more committed than ever to ship the product features that will help us deliver    Photography courtesy of ClassPass,"[365 494 549 1036 916 328 13 442 23 32 80]"

367,training-dataset/business/1081.txt,business,How we de risked our SaaS pricing strategyThe pain point that every single B2B company shares is pricing   Countless philosophies flood the web on how to price your product  just see here  here  and here   More than 500 pricing products and services are offered in the tech space  All of this points to the fact that  when it comes to pricing  most people don t know what they re doing   For a long time  neither did we   Pricing is inherently risky because your revenue depends on getting it right  Yet there isn t one de facto strategy that works  Mailchimp has had great success with their freemium pricing plan  which businesses can stay on forever  While CampaignMonitor a functionally similar tool has no free tier and scales their pricing according to email volume along with features   We learned the hard way that there s no silver bullet for pricing  More importantly  we found a way to constantly improve our pricing  here s how we de risked our pricing strategy   The first price tag  When we were first developing our pricing strategy  we were very concerned about getting it right  We didn t want to price ourselves out of the market  but we didn t want to undervalue the tool we were so proud of building  Like many other companies  we didn t want to make the wrong decision and be pigeon holed as a certain type of brand   After much deliberation  we ended up starting with a freemium plan  hoping to get our name out there and get some good feedback on the product    Front s first ever pricing page   After getting some initial traction  we continued on a similar trajectory to many other freemium SaaS companies  we went upmarket  We dropped our free plan and added a  tailored  enterprise plan  hoping to catch a few big fish    Front s pricing page  v 2   In the course of two years we only changed our pricing three times  Each time  we factored in all the details we were told were important   LTV CAC  That golden ratio of 3 1 was a great starting benchmark  but as we grew we had bigger aspirations   That golden ratio of 3 1 was a great starting benchmark  but as we grew we had bigger aspirations  Market

progression made sense for upsells and upgrades   We made sure we were packaging and pricing appropriately for each tier  and the progression made sense for upsells and upgrades  Price vs  value  Pricing experts say that you should have price elasticity a price that is less dependent on cost of building and acquiring and more dependent on the product s value to the customers   We were constantly second guessing ourselves did we want to go cheap for the masses  or expensive for the few  Were we delivering more value than our pricing indicated  Should we focus more on that top 20  of customers that contribute to 80  of our revenue  These are questions that gnaw on practically every startup team   We weren t wrong to be considering all these questions  but every change in our pricing felt like a huge risk  Because we changed pricing so infrequently  we could never tell how customers might react  Once or twice we tried to make a big change  but when the numbers dropped we d quickly change it back  We needed to find a way to improve pricing more quickly and with less risk   Our secret weapon  It was after a chat with the team at Intercom about eight months ago that we realized the obvious  iterating on pricing more frequently would give us more data on what works and what doesn t  So instead of changing prices once a year  we decided to get experimental   We set aside three weeks for our developers to make some internal adjustments to make pricing changes easier  We needed our software to give us the flexibility to experiment quickly and often  Naturally it cost us resources up front  but the investment was well worth it   We went from iterating once a year to once every three weeks  Now when we make changes  we compare the new cohort to the previous ones  if the cohorts behave similarly or the new one is even better  we stick with the new pricing plan  If not  we just roll back to a pricing structure that s worked well previously   The best part about the experimental approach is that it s safe  Because we test on small cohorts  there are fewer repercussions for totally screwing up  So instead of making big  infrequent jumps in our pricing  we evolve our pricing little by little at a steady cadence   With every iteration  we have a better sense of how our customers value our product  Our experiments are also what led us to discover that even enterprise clients want to see a number on our pricing page      Front s pricing page v  20   A lot of people fear changing pricing too often because they think it will scare away their customers  And for some that might be true  But never experimenting with your pricing means you may never learn the value of your product and its potential for growth   We don t have pricing all figured out  But we have found a low risk way to experiment and get closer to our optimal pricing point and we thought that alone was worth sharing  Here is how our pricing page looks like now   DIY pricing experiments  To build your own experimental pricing strategy  you need more than just numbers and spreadsheets  You need to focus on behavioral and revenue data and find a way to group and compare that data over time   Start by nailing down your  value metric  what your customers are paying for  This can be something like number of videos hosted  inboxes created  or reports processed  You can gather that info from simple surveys sent out to your customers  either through email or in app   From there  decide how often you want to experiment  we recommend no longer than every two months   At each iteration pay attention to how the use of your value metric has grown  Maybe people were hosting 10 videos on your platform but are now hosting 100 that means you should raise your pricing accordingly   At the end of each period  compare the cohorts and pay particular attention to   Revenue  If you raise prices  your revenue should increase  If your price raise comes at a cost to your acquisition numbers  then your revenue will reflect that   If you raise prices  your revenue should increase  If your price raise comes at a cost to your acquisition numbers  then your revenue will

drop  revert to a previous iteration   Your price changes should positively impact user activity   you want to be attracting users that are engaged with your product  If your pricing changes cause engagement to drop  revert to a previous iteration  Retention  It s important to look at whether you re acquiring users that stick around  Make sure that your acquisition numbers aren t masking a churn problem   If you don t have the time or dev resources to build an analytics tool in house  consider hooking up to a third party tool like Amplitude  You can group users based on cohort and look at views that compare each cohort s behaviors  Every test you perform will point you toward better pricing choices without risking your entire revenue for the month,"[367 155 1268 1231 703 459 1009

372,training-dataset/product/84.txt,product,Developing User EmpathyI m a firm believer that the best product managers understand that mastering the discipline requires deeply excelling at both the art and science of product management  When you start your career in product management you tend to be largely focused on the science  how to effectively do customer research  run an A B test  manage a sprint  write a spec  and so on  And while those are critically important to being a great product manager  they aren t sufficient  It s those that understand and appreciate the art of product management that do the best  They understand that certain aspects can t be learned by simply reading a set of best practices  taking a class  or applying a technique  They appreciate that certain innate skills and inordinate deliberate practice are necessary to truly excel  I d put a bunch of aspects of product management into this category  prioritizing a roadmap  effective communication  formulating a vision  negotiating with stakeholders  and team leadership  to name a few  Over time I hope to dive deeper into each of these topics because I think they are so important and often not written about in detail because the right approach is not easily picked up in a few hours  but instead requires years of focus and effort Today I wanted to dive into one such critical aspect of the art behind product management  which is developing user empathy  The reason this is so important is that I ve seen product teams who faithfully have run a customer validation exercise and have executed incredibly well against the science of customer validation  identifying the specific target audience  recruiting a critical mass of folks to interview  developing a strong interview guide to answer their most burning questions  and synthesizing the feedback across interviews into a set of product requirements for their next iteration  And yet  the product plans that come out of this process can often be uninspired and little more than a regurgitation of the feedback customers directly gave them on what to develop and how to design their product  Worse  after developing the product directly based on the results of this customer validation process  I ve seen products still struggle to find the elusive product market fit   So what s going on here  To me this speaks to how the science of product management isn t enough to develop compelling products  Instead this is where the art is needed  and specifically in this case what s often missing is a strong dose of user empathy Empathy is the ability to understand or feel what another person is experiencing  Or in other words  the ability to walk a mile in another person s shoes  It goes well beyond  gathering their requirements  to truly understanding their hopes  dreams  frustrations  fears  proclivities  and more  It requires us to move past the classic economic view of humans as rational decision makers to a full acceptance of the emotive and psychological beings we really are  It s this empathy that enables great product managers to really grock the pain points their users are suffering and develop compelling products that truly delight them The challenge with developing user empathy is it first requires us to get out of our own heads and our own frame of reference that we bring to the world  Since our own sense of perspective drives every one of our daily decisions  it s often challenging to comprehend another person s wildly different outlook on life  Equally challenging in building user empathy is developing a deep appreciation for the depth  breadth  and nuance of human emotions and experiences  It requires us to move beyond the personified emotions so well expressed in Inside Out  joy  sadness  anger  fear  and disgust  to the complexities of real life  mixed emotions  dissonance  peer pressure  vanity  herd mentality  and so much more Some folks have such strong innate emotional intelligence  EQ  that empathy comes incredibly naturally to them  They re the folks you see that seem to get along with everyone  the ones who develop an intimacy with friends and colleagues so effortlessly  The ones who always make you feel understood  The ones that often share that rare insight that you missed when reflecting on someone s behavior  Their innate curiosity and love for other people fuels these capabilities But how about for the rest of us  How do we hone our own ability to empathize with our target audience  I ll preface this with saying there is no quick fix silver bullet solutions here  While certain techniques like active listening are helpful  it ll take much more than them to truly empathize with your audience  Here are a few approaches on just how to go about developing your empathy There is a reason the expression is walk a mile in another person s shoes  not a foot or a yard  The best way to develop empathy for a specific audience is to truly immerse yourself in their lives or work  Often a 60 or 90 minute interview is far from sufficient to understanding their plight  So find ways to create this total immersion  Day long shadowing is one such technique  Or actually doing the job or role of the person you re developing products for  Before I led product for LinkedIn Sales Navigator targeted at sales professionals  I had personally gone on dozens of sales calls and helped close some of the largest sales deals at a previous employer  helping me develop a deep understanding of the life of a sales rep  I similarly had my team  product managers  designers  engineers  etc  do a day long shadowing with our own sales team at LinkedIn to really grock what a day in the life looked like  Immersion techniques  while time consuming  are a sure fire way to increase your empathy for a given audience While total immersion works  ideally we want to build our innate skills for empathy to enable us to empathize with far less effort  To do this we ll need to address both of the challenges of doing so  appreciating the depth  breadth  and nuance of human emotions as well as truly lifting ourselves out of our own world view into another s  Mindfulness is a great set of techniques to help with the former  Appreciating your own breadth of thoughts and feelings goes a long way in your ability to appreciate anothers  And that s exactly what mindfulness helps you do  Mindfulness is simply a set of techniques that enable you to focus your attention on the internal and external experiences you are having in the present moment  It enables you to act as a rational observer to your own thoughts and emotions so you can be aware of what you re thinking  what impact external factors are having on your thoughts and emotions  and even just an appreciation of the range of emotions you experience  For those skeptical of mindfulness I d say this  the high EQ folks we all know do this so effortlessly  Mindfulness is simply a form of deliberate practice for the rest of us  New to mindfulness  Try out either the Headspace or 10  Happier apps for a bite sized  approachable introduction One of the observations I ve had is the product managers most in tune with their target audience are also the ones with the strongest relationships with their colleagues  This is because the same empathy they use to empathize with their target audience they apply to empathizing with their colleagues  Building strong relationships and rapport with your various team members then becomes an excellent way to practice empathy on a daily basis that pays dividends by not only greasing the wheels of team dynamics but also enabling you to build better products  To do so  make sure your colleagues feel heard in every interaction  find simple ways to increase the meaning and happiness they derive from their work  and take a curiosity in their work and personal lives  You can t end up doing any of these things well without learning to empathize with each and every one of them The humanities are often described as the study of how people process and document the human experience  making it so relevant to developing empathy  Steve Jobs so often talked about how at Apple they tried to be at the intersection of liberal arts and technology  And what he knew so well is that an appreciation of the arts is really an appreciation of humanity and the human condition  Some might suggest the study of psychology as a more direct way to understand humanity  While certainly helpful  I find that simply a rational study of various psychological principles is far from sufficient to really appreciate them  It s the classic story of show not tell  And the humanities are a far better way to show and experience those various principles  You may notice your most well read colleagues tend to have a stronger EQ as well  I personally love music and spend a ton of my time immersed in it  Find your passion and dedicate time to it  Not just for fun  But for improving your own empathy I should call out there is indeed one shortcut to all of this  which is developing products for yourself  In this case you are your own target audience and you have had depth of experiences in the problem space you are attacking  making your own world view aligned with your end users and enabling you to extensively leverage your own product intuition to guide the roadmap and development of the product  Paul Graham at Y Combinator consistently encouraged folks to do this because it certainly had the highest chances of succeeding since you take out so much of the risk associated with empathy and ultimately product market fit  You still need to be careful in ensuring the target audience is in fact like you and ultimately a sufficiently large audience that is worth addressing  But it certainly helps shortcut a lot of the challenges of empathy in the earliest stages I hope this motivated the importance of empathy in product management and gave you some life long habits you can build to develop your own empathy,"[372 864 1002 502 741 859 328 1253 1121 101 151]"
378,training-dataset/product/554.txt,product,Key Questions to Answer Before Customer Testing48 Flares 48 Flares    Anyone who wants to get a new product or service to market must be confident that what they re selling will be successful  The process of building confidence involves work   before the concept is decided through market research to identify the opportunity  during the build with research to gauge customer reaction and again once the product is ready for use   I want to focus on this last element  how can you work with real customers to establish whether your product will be successful  and work out what elements need to be addressed before you launch  This effectively is beta testing  trials of a pre released product by real users  in situations as close to real world applications as is possible  To maximise the benefits of customer testing  consider these four fundamental questions you need to answer   What are you hoping to learn   Running a customer test activity is time consuming  It s a major undertaking to recruit an audience and then ensure that you ve got them engaged and using the product  Once you ve got them engaged  you then need to collect the critical information that will tell you whether the product has performed successfully which means persuading your audience to actively participate in giving you feedback   Before starting customer testing  it s important to understand what you want to prove or learn  which may vary depending on your perspective  For example   If you ve invested or designed the product or service  you want feedback on its market fit   how well it meets the needs of your audience  and which user group it resonates with most  You want to know whether your product is something that consumers can see benefit in and assign value to   If you re responsible for managing customer service  then you ll want to identify any bugs that may have been missed in testing  Considering all the variables seen in real life  100  testing simply isn t practical or realistic   If you re managing the development team  you ll want to identify any new possible features or improvements before the product ramps up to a wider audience   If you re in marketing or sales  you want to create a distinct group of loyal customers who will become evangelists for your service and give you onward referrals  as well as discovering the most effective messaging to use for the target audience   So  to start with  it s worth considering why you want to run the customer test so that you understand what your priorities are  and that you gain the maximum benefits from the activity  If your objectives aren t clear  or could be achieved by another route   perhaps by using internal test teams to find bugs rather than looking to customers to identify them   then customer testing may not be appropriate   What information does your customer testing need to provide   Understanding why you re running customer testing is about asking critical questions before investing your time and effort  The same is true for understanding what the key information is that you want to measure  Are you exploring which parts of the service are most attractive  Testing the price points  Is it about validating how customers use the product in real life   Perhaps the easiest way to tackle this challenge is to consider these steps   Having understood the reasons for the trial  make sure you know exactly what information will inform your decision making  For example  if you re assessing whether customers like a tweak to the service  consider the new Evernote interface  perhaps you can consider what new features they use  how new navigation affects behaviours and whether customers prefer it to the old interface   For each of these pieces of information  you then need to consider how you will capture feedback  Will you monitor product usage via click throughs and page views versus the original version  Or will you need to collect direct customer feedback from focus groups or survey tools  By asking the right questions  and guiding answers that assist your analysis  you are much more likely to get results that help you draw tangible conclusions   It s worth investing time and effort to ensure that you ask the right questions of your audience  Take a look at this Survey Monkey blog to understand the kind of mistakes that can be made  Teams that regularly do UX or customer research can help with balanced questions that will help you really understand the issues with your products   It s now time to prioritise   think through who your trial users should be and how much feedback you re likely to get from them  Some measures may well be  nice to have   but not at the expense of really important metrics   Finally you need to be absolutely clear about what marks success  specifically what scores must be achieved on each of the key measures you ve identified  This is something that must be considered in advance  ideally you should set these targets right up front when you started setting out the vision for the new product or service  It s much easier to remain objective before you start a trial  especially if you have multiple teams involved  put another way  it s nigh on impossible to remain unbiased once the trial has started and the data collection begins   If you fail to set measures then the most likely outcome is that the service launched fails to deliver a decent return on investment  For example  I decided to add a security software subscription to a premium support offering I managed   it took time to train our field engineers to sell the product and major investment in designing systems to record and communicate the sale to the third party that provided the software  However the project failed because engineers ended up offering free security installs for the majority of customers  rather than the paid for equivalent  We had ignored the warning sign of the poor score we received for perceived value of the software because we had thought that the positive reactions in a number of other areas would compensate for this   In summary  a clear set of measures and targets means you ll know what success looks like  and that you have a clear understanding of what information you need and how to get it  This should also trigger the conversation about what happens if you don t hit the metrics  Will you allow some flexibility if a few of the success criteria aren t met  or are these absolute minimums that must be achieved for the product to move forward into production   Who will trial your products   A trial clearly can t work without the audience to test the product  Probably the biggest challenge in any trial is locating the people who will test your product for you   In order to identify what trial users you need  consider the following   How many trial users do you need  Is it possible to get fewer trial users who use the product more thoroughly  Or are you interested in getting a wider base of individuals to gauge reaction and engagement  Do you need to test multiple potential target markets  or audience demographics   What do you need the trial users to do   are you simply asking them to use the product  or to run specific trial scenarios  or even to give detailed feedback on the service   How will customers react to the version of the product that you re looking to test   will they be put off by any gaps in the product or any issues with the service  Is there any risk they might publicly criticise the product you are trialling   Do you need completely new customers or can you use existing customers to test the product   It s not unusual to face a shortfall in trial users despite a creative approach to recruitment  One option is to incentivise them  via a giveaway  competition  or discount on the product pricing  However  you should never lose sight of the fact that the incentive is a vehicle to encourage your audience to participate in trials and give feedback on your product  it needs to be appropriate to the test and avoid unduly influencing the results you get   Keep in mind that you want accurate  impartial views of your product  You need the hard truth about whether your product is going to be successful or not  If friendly customers or incentivised trial participants have sugar coated any gaps or issues because they don t want to offend you or risk their incentive  you may end up with a rude awakening when you take your product to the wider market   When should you trial your products   When is the right time to beta test the product  Too early  and there s a high likelihood that there will be too many bugs or issues that will affect the customer experience  Too late  and you risk burning development time and effort on the wrong areas  and needlessly delaying product launch   Generally the pressure is to trial early  which is great as long as your trial base is keen to participate and happy to accept and give feedback on glitches in the product  However  significant numbers of product issues and bugs could end up alienating these trial customers  so it does need to be considered carefully  Much of the art of timing is about setting the appropriate expectations with trial users during their recruitment  and balancing what they will be prepared to forgive when they are invited to be  the first trial users who will get to see our new product    Clearly  there is no single right answer to this question  as it very much depends on the nature of your product and the tolerance of your audience for incomplete products  As a product manager  you need to understand your audience well enough to make this judgement  and some small early trials in the development process might help you gauge this better   Once you ve worked through these fundamental questions  you should have a clear idea of what you hope to learn  as well as how you will get the information you need  The next step is to work out how to run your trials,"[378 106 431 13 916 365 494 23 502 888 328]"

405,training-dataset/product/572.txt,product,Rethink your onboarding for companies not usersOnboarding a company to your product is different from onboarding an individual user   It requires many people across departments to get setup and start seeing the value your product can provide   If you sell your product to businesses and haven t designed your onboarding to support groups of people  you re likely asking people to complete tasks they re not capable of or lack the permissions to do   As your company grows and starts selling to larger companies  rethinking how your onboarding helps groups of people work together will have a greater impact than optimizing an existing step by step flow designed for individuals   What works for one breaks down for many  Your beautiful  linear sequence of onboarding steps might work well for individual users  but teams behave unpredictably   So as larger companies start using your product  instead of just asking  How many people made it from step A to step B    you might start asking different questions  such as   Why would someone in a group be unable to complete this step   Who in their company might be able to help them   What is blocking them from asking for help   We ve asked ourselves these questions as Intercom has grown  Our customers have become increasingly diverse in size  which has impacted the order in which we previously expected common actions to be done   Early on the vast majority of our customers were small startups and our onboarding reflected that   it was designed to help one engineer install a JavaScript snippet  But our customers are no longer small startups working out of one room  We have to onboard companies where it may require more than one person to code  authorize integrations and teach teams how to use our products   We ve learned great onboarding acknowledges that different groups of people take very different paths to get started  and gives them multiple paths for them to progress as a team   Designing predictable steps for unpredictable groups  The mistake most companies make is trying to model their onboarding as an ordered series of steps  They have a very definite idea of what step should be completed in what order  This single linear sequence of steps quickly breaks down for groups of people   Not convinced  Consider you re building an iPad app for a reception desk that lets guests sign in and notifies employees when they arrive  In order to be set up  a new customer might need to   Sign up for an account  Enter a credit card to start a trial  Authorize Google Apps access to get employees email addresses  Add a legal document or NDA for visitors to sign  Place the iPad in a stand at the front desk  Completing all of these requires participation from   Someone with access to a company credit card  Someone with administrative access to the Google Apps account  Legal counsel  Office manager s  or receptionist s   At a very small company  this could be just 2 3 people  At a larger company  it could be dozens  Let s see what happens if you make the mistake of modeling these steps in a linear way   Sign up for an account Enter a credit card to start a trial Authorize Google Apps access to get employees email addresses Add a legal document or NDA for visitors to sign Place the iPad in a stand at the front desk  If someone without a company credit card signs up  they ll be stuck on step 2  At a company of 100 people  that might be 80  of people who could possibly sign up for your product  The same holds for the rest of the steps   the potential for failure is massive  Who has permissions to connect Google Apps  Who knows our lawyer s email  Who has the stand for the iPad  Who is it I can ask for the credit card again   Modeled in this way  as a blocking sequence of steps  there s only one person at the company who could complete every step  unassisted   the CEO  And if the only person at a company who can complete your onboarding is the busiest person  with the least time  you have a problem   We had a similar problem at Intercom as we grew  Previously  in order to sign up for an account  we made people add a code snippet or import data from a CSV or third party service  In some ways  this was a good thing   we were able to show customers Intercom working on their own website or app right away   But it also meant we blocked anyone who couldn t add a code snippet or import data from doing anything else  Once we changed this to allow anyone to create an account right away  and then add a code snippet or data import afterwards  more people were able to make more progress through our onboarding   How to expect unexpected paths  Since it s hard to predict who will do each task  or which order tasks will be completed in  designing onboarding means designing for a moving target  It requires the humility to know that it will never be perfect  This is especially true for a growing company  whose customers are increasingly diverse and often get larger overtime   That said  we ve found three strategies that work for dealing with the unexpected paths our customers take in the onboarding process   1  Provide an escape hatch  While you have a new customer s attention  allow them to accomplish as much as they are capable of or have permission to do  right away   It s hard to recapture this attention  to get them to come back to your product  especially to do something boring  like enter a credit card or create an API key  So while you have their attention  provide ways for them to skip to other steps they can accomplish   Remember  it s almost always better to let people keep moving and exploring  The conversion rate lost on one small step is made up by the customer s overall progress and comprehension of what your product has to offer,"[405 709 222 244 1282 1214 999 353 1239 427 328]"
410,training-dataset/business/770.txt,business,How Slack Grew Into A Billion Dollar Company       Without A Sales TeamSell me this pen   It s the best known and most frequently dissected interview question that salespeople face  yet in most cases  it s not even phrased as a question   Here s how it usually goes down  The interviewer will lean across the table  perhaps with a smirk  in anticipation of what s to come    Then she ll slowly open her hand to reveal the object while simultaneously speaking those four famous words    Sell me this pen   Of course  the sales experts of the world will tell you that the pen problem is all about evaluating a candidate s approach to selling   A  correct  answer will demonstrate that the candidate knows how to tease out and identify the needs of the prospective customer  and is then able to express the value of the pen in terms the prospective customer will appreciate and understand   And while this can be a useful exercise  it s also an exercise that s rooted in a very traditional approach to selling   an approach that puts the burden of proving a product s value on the shoulders of a salesperson  as opposed to letting a prospective customer discover the product s value on his or her own   A Different Solution To The Pen Problem  If Slack co founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield were faced with the pen problem    Sell me this pen    I d like to think that his initial response would simply be   No    But when pushed to elaborate  his explanation might go something like this   Instead of me trying to push this pen on you  I m going to create a better pen  Scratch that  I m going to create the best pen  I m going to do extensive user testing  make changes based on what I learn  then do more testing  then make more changes  and after I go through this cycle enough times  I ll arrive at a product that is far superior to the pen currently sitting on your desk  And that s when I ll start selling you   on how amazing it is to take notes and sign signatures with pens   Eventually  through word of mouth and some basic advertising  my brand will become synonymous with the art of writing with pens  Meanwhile  my superior pen product will have hit the market  and you ll inevitably hear about how great it is from friends and coworkers  Then one day  you ll try it  And you ll love it   And you ll want one   Alright  yes  I know this sounds like some fanciful bullshit   And if you re applying for a sales role  using such a response will certainly raise some eyebrows  but it probably  definitely  won t help your chances of getting the job   After all  you d essentially be telling the interviewer that if the company had an amazing product  and an amazing brand  they wouldn t need to be hiring for that sales role in the first place   And while it may sound far fetched or impractical to forgo using a traditional sales organization  and to instead depend solely on your product and your brand in order to grow   it s not impossible  Companies have done it  And most recently  Slack did it   Here s the real story behind Slack s explosive growth   Slack Attack  Slack Technologies  originally Tiny Speck  launched a beta version of their messaging software in 2013   In 2014  they launched officially with 16 thousand active users  By year s end  Slack would have 285 thousand active users   73 thousand of them paid   Oh  right  and Slack closed out 2014 with a  1 12 billion valuation  thanks to a  120 million round of funding led by Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield   Byers    In 2015  Slack broke the 1 million active user mark and ended the year with 300 thousand paid users  They also raised a  160 million round led by Social Capital  which put their valuation at  2 8 billion   2016  Slack surpassed 2 million active users   675 thousand of them paid   and they raised a  200 million venture round led by Thrive Capital that put their valuation at  3 8 billion   To be sure  there s no single factor that can account for Slack s utterly  ridiculously  supernaturally high level of growth   But we do know that during the first several years  Slack didn t have an outbound sales team  nor did they have an elaborate marketing operation   So cold calling and lead generation lead nurturing campaigns  the staples of many high growth SaaS operations  weren t levers they were pulling   And yet  Slack was able to go from 0 to nearly  4 billion in less than four years   How the heck did they do it   An Experienced Founding Team  Butterfield co founded Slack with Eric Costello  Cal Henderson  and Serguei Mourachov   all of whom were also instrumental in helping Butterfield build an earlier company  Flickr   Launched in 2004  Flickr was the brainchild of Butterfield and wife Caterina Fake  But instead of setting out to revolutionize the world of online photo sharing  the husband and wife developement duo came up with the product while building a massively multiplayer online game  MMO    Part of the game   which was called Game Neverending  in case you were wondering   required the ability to upload and share photos  And after building that photo sharing feature  Butterfield and Fake realized it was perhaps a more interesting product than the game itself   In March of 2005  just a year after its launch  Flickr was acquired by Yahoo for an estimated  35 million  which is both an incredibly high sum  by my standards  and an incredibly low sum  by tech company exit standards    If Butterfield and co  had held off selling Flickr for just a little bit longer  they likely would ve seen a much larger return  At the time  the post dot com bubble malaise was starting to lift  and tech companies were seeing an upswing in their valuations   Just months after Flickr s exit  in July of 2005  Myspace got acquired by News Corp  for  580 million  Then  in 2006  YouTube got scooped up by Google for  1 65 billion   Suddenly   35 million for what was at the time the world s leading online photo sharing service sounds like a ripoff    Looking back on the Yahoo deal in a 2014 interview with TechCrunch  Butterfield readily admits that it was a mistake to sell Flickr so early    We definitely made the wrong decision in retrospect  We would ve made 10 times  what we did   But it s not like I regret it    Today  Butterfield s new company  Slack  isn t worth just 10 times what Flickr was sold for  it s worth more than 100 times that figure   Clearly  Butterfield and co  have learned from their past mistakes  But at the same time  they ve also stuck to the same product development playbook they used to come up with Flickr   In a strange twist of fate  or irony  or however you want to characterize this situation  Slack started out as a feature in an MMO the team was developing  called Glitch   The game required a chat messaging feature  and not being able to find one to their satisfaction  Butterfield and co  built one from scratch   As was the case with Game Neverending s photo sharing feature  Glitch s chat feature soon became more impressive than the game itself   And that s how Slack was born   Good Timing  Butterfield and his Slack co founders Costello  Henderson  and Mourachov started working on Slack in 2012  which will forever be remembered as the year that A  the world didn t end on December 21st  and B  people reached peak frustration levels with email   2012 was the year we saw headlines like  Stop Email Overload   Harvard Business Review  and  Be A Bitch On Email  Or Be Email s Bitch   TechCrunch   So it turned out to be a great time for Butterfield and co  to be working on a chat and collaboration tool that had the potential to make up for many of email s shortcomings   The fact that they were already well known in the tech community from their Flickr days didn t hurt Butterfield and his co founders either  From the beginning  the product received tons of press that helped bolster Slack s status as a tool that had the power to replace email   Just look at some of these headlines from 2013     Flickr Cofounders Launch Slack  An Email Killer    Fast Company     Flickr founder plans to kill company e mails with Slack    CNET     The Co Founder Of Flickr Wants To Replace Email At The Office    Business Insider    Again  the timing couldn t be better  At the height of this anti email fervor  a team with some serious tech street cred comes out with a product that promises to make company communication problems obsolete   Slack s genesis also coincided with another major event in the world of communication technology  Smartphone ownership reaching critical mass   Between 2012 and 2013  the percent of adults in the U S  who owned smartphones broke 50   growing from 46  to 56   The notion of being constantly connected   or  put another way  being unable to unplug   had become a norm  especially among tech savvy business people   Once again  this was good timing for Butterfield and co   who were A  developing a messaging application that was compatible with iPhones  iPads  and Android devices  and B  building a brand around improving inter employee communication   Free Product   Loveable Brand  Slack is part of a recent wave of companies  which also includes MailChimp and Asana  that have adopted a product driven approach to sales and marketing   Instead of optimizing for MQLs  marketing qualified leads  or SQLs  sales qualified leads   these companies are optimizing for PQLs  product qualified leads    And all this really means is that instead of growing a massive database of contacts that needs to be combed through in order to identify people who could potentially be a good fit for the product  these product first companies are focused on driving sign ups  The name of the game is getting people to use the product as early as possible so they can experience for themselves how great it is   Of course  part of that approach entails offering a completely free version of the product  payment  after all  is a pretty significant barrier to entry   Hence  any person and any team can use Slack for free   forever   Pricing only kicks in if you want unlock more features  like additional storage or the ability to integrate with more apps   But this freemium pricing model alone can t account for how Slack has been able to drive so many sign ups in such a short amount of time  Another big piece of the puzzle  the Slack brand   If we take a peek at what Slack s homepage looked like back in 2013  it s abundantly clear what action the company wanted you to take   Sign Up    But at the same time  their messaging was casual  Almost reassuring   Relax  Your team s communication problems  We ve got that        And then there s that full width background photo of a desk with a bunch of crap on it   just like my desk   That s some good product marketing  It s as if the founders of Slack understood what it s like to work in an office  on a team  So instead of blasting us with jargon  they developed a brand voice that sounds like the voice of a trusted friend or colleague   someone who s in the trenches with us  but who isn t afraid to crack a joke and have some fun every now and then   This playful yet helpful style carries over seamlessly into the product  where the colors  micro copy  signature  knock knock  notification sound  and fun features like Slackbot all contribute to a cohesive  and lovable  brand experience  And perfecting that experience has been instrumental to Slack s success     As Butterfield wrote in a memo to the Slack team back in 2013      even the best slogans  ads  landing pages  PR campaigns  etc   will fall down if they are not supported by the experience people have when they hit our site  when they sign up for an account  when they first begin using the product and when they start using it day in  day out    And to reiterate  Slack isn t just focused on making their product stellar  All of the moving pieces that surround and lead into their product also need to be stellar   As Butterfield noted  instead of getting people to understand their product s value through sales and marketing  the Slack team was able to accomplish this  with copy accompanying signup forms  with fast loading pages  with good welcome emails  with comprehensive and accurate search  with purposeful loading screens  and with thoughtfully implemented and well functioning features of all kinds    Of course  that s not to say that Slack has completely shunned more traditional approaches to driving awareness and growing sales  At the South by Southwest conference in 2016  Butterfield made it clear what his top two favorite marketing tactics are   Number one  Word of mouth  no surprise there    Number two  Paid advertising   The thing that Butterfield likes specifically about paid advertising is that it s easy to turn on and off  If an advertisement for Slack isn t working  they can simply stop running it   Compare that to what would happen if a massive sales operation you had built out stopped working    As Butterfield said at South by Southwest    In a sales driven organization  it s hard to rev up the speed because you have to hire more salespeople  and if you ever want to stop  you have to lay all those people off which is a horrible situation to be in    Final Thought  As far as sales is concerned  Butterfield was clear in his 2013 memo  titled   We Don t Sell Saddles Here   that Slack isn t in the business of selling messaging software  Instead  they re focused on selling the innovation   the change   that their software can bring to teams and companies   And at the broadest level  the innovation that Slack is selling is  organizational transformation   which can manifest itself as   a reduction in the cost of communication  or  zero effort knowledge management  or  making better decisions  faster  or  all your team communication  instantly searchable  available wherever you go  or  75  less email     Sure  this might all sound a bit aspirational  But when you consider how fast Slack has been growing  and how satisfied Slack s customers are  it s hard to claim that Butterfield s strategy hasn t been working   Ultimately  however  Slack is a unique case  It s product especially sort of lends itself to this PQL sales less approach  Unlike most B2B products  Slack isn t specific to one department or discipline  All teams need to communicate  which means once Slack gets into a company via individual users or teams  it has the potential to spread company wide   As a platform  Slack also has some unique advantages  As opposed to being a single tool that people use for a single task  re  chat   Slack can be used for a host of other communication and collaboration functions thanks to all the apps that integrate with it  What s more  since these integrations are constantly bringing new functionality to the platform  Slack will continue to get more and more powerful   another big selling point   And while Slack didn t rely on a traditional sales organization in the early days  they are employing salespeople now  Still  the company tends to favor brand building and traditional advertising  e g   their recent TV spot   over sales  As Butterfield tweeted back in March of 2016   referencing earlier comments he made about Slack s approach to sales and marketing   We have lots of salespeople and are hiring more  I just said that organic is best   paid marketing is 2nd    So to be clear  the point of this story isn t to convince you to fire your sales team  or to remove all the lead generation forms from your website   It s simply to show you that there are other approaches to sales and marketing out there   approaches that treat salespeople more as product educators as opposed to product pushers  and that value product sign ups and engagement over lead generation and vanity metrics,"[410 174 970

427,training-dataset/product/251.txt,product,How to turn great Technology into great Products   PivotWhat does productise mean   Most startups begin with a great idea and technical expertise  But there s a profound difference between great technology and a great product  This post is for anyone who wants to build a product that people will actually use  Not just technology that solves a problem but won t scale  The verb I use to describe this process is  productise   To productise means to turn something into a product   I ll explore the principles of productisation then drill down into a specific example  The example I use is x ai s Amy  the AI bot who acts as your personal assistant  Amy became de rigueur for scheduling meetings in the startup and VC community in 2016   I chose Amy because she s a great example of AI that s been developed into a consumer product  Of technology that s been successfully  productised    Amy s also noteworthy because x ai  the company who created her  profess to be  Anti Lean   As product people  we re all familiar with Lean Startup  Lean has been the prevailing philosophy of product development for some time  So  it s interesting to observe the emergence of startups proudly claiming to be Anti Lean   If we imagine an axis of  lean ness   there are unicorns like Airbnb or Dropbox at one end  These are cast from the classic Y Combinator  lean  mould  At the other extreme is a company like Tesla  No one could accuse Elon Musk of being a lean practitioner  Everything he does is a moonshot  requiring enormous capital investment   Somewhere to the left of Tesla is a cohort of AI companies  like x ai and Clarif ai  who explicitly state   Lean just doesn t work for us   x ai needed three years of R D investment to get their product into the market  Anti Lean requires more upfront capital  It also affords less opportunity for iteration and pivot  Anti Lean companies need to be more certain about their users  and their users  needs  when they do launch   Why is productising important   Productisation means translating a vision into a product that is usable and capable of global traction  The principal benefit of productisation is that it helps you cross the chasm  Geoffrey Moore famously identified a market chasm that separates companies who appeal to a small group of technology geeks from those who appeal to the mass market  His book of the same name explores all the factors that impacts a startup s ability to make the leap  Productisation is one aspect of this   Productisation also guards against Stack Fallacy  This idea comes from Anshu Sharma  once a Product Manager at Oracle and now a partner at Storm Ventures  Stack Fallacy suggests that  within any given technology stack  each provider overvalues the significance of their own layer  They also undervalue the significance of other layers  especially those higher up the stack   Stack Fallacy is the reason  Database companies believe that SaaS apps are  just a database app   which gives them false confidence that they can easily build  compete and win in this new market    According to Anshu  the companies who prevail are the ones that win at the user experience layer  They understand the end user s context  motivations and desired outcomes best   As a Product Manager  I support his view  In my experience  winning in the market means thinking about customer value  not individual screens  Productisation means focussing on outcomes rather than features   We re all familiar with the  jobs to be done  theory of products  People don t use a product because they like the product itself  Instead  they rent them to achieve specific outcomes  Clay Christensen s theory gained a lot of ground this year  I think  for good reason  I firmly believe that most utility products are tools that help people achieve outcomes  Only emotional aspects  like brand or aesthetics  really transcend it   Productisation means focusing on the outcome the user is trying to achieve  rather than the underlying technology  This is more critical than ever thanks to exponentially increasing levels of competition  Two stats jumped out at me from Mary Meeker s 2016 Internet Report  The first is that  in America  80 per cent of people s time is spent in just three apps  No prizes for guessing which apps  Nielsen data  published at the end of the year  indicates that the top 8 mobile apps are owned by just 2 companies  Google and Facebook   The second stat is that 50  of people download zero new apps per month  This indicates the scale of the challenge new entrants face just to get attention  The adoption rate of new apps has plateaued because there s too many to choose from  What this means for startups is  you only get a moment to make an impression  If you can t communicate your value in that moment  you ve lost   The 3 Pillars of Product  What does it mean to be a  product   There are three pillars  onboarding  core task completion and administration  You should think about your product in those terms  The vector that cuts across all three is user familiarity  To design each pillar  consider your users  mindset as they interact with your product over time   Users  understanding of a product begins during onboarding  At this point  they ll only have a minimal grasp of what you do  If they progress through onboarding  and begin using the product to complete tasks  they ll inevitably become more familiar with it  If they continue to use it  and it becomes part of their lives  then administration of the product becomes increasingly important   It s possible to add a fourth pillar to the left of those three  The acquisition pillar  This is where the user first becomes aware of your product  I won t cover acquisition in detail as it s technically part of marketing  which sits outside of product  But it s important to bear in mind as product and marketing form part of the same continuum   Chamath Palihapitiya put it best when he observed    Users are only ever in three states   they ve never heard about it  they ve tried it  and they use it  What you re managing is state change    Understanding the user mindset is key to the successful development of each pillar  You need to ask what the user is saying at each stage  At the acquisition stage  the user doesn t know you  doesn t know anything about you  What they re saying is  Who are you and why would I use you  Why should I even care   During onboarding  they re saying  I m considering you  I ve bothered to take time to play around with you  I m thinking about you  but you still need to convince me    Once they reach core task completion  they ve already passed a major milestone  At this point they re saying   I get you  I understand what you re about and I can see the value   The administration pillar is all about customisation  The user s saying  I get the value of what you re providing  but I want to adapt you to my own needs    If you re familiar with Dave McClure s  pirate metrics   it s possible to map them against the four pillars  On the left are the acquisition metrics  Activation occurs during onboarding  Retention and revenue are core tasks  Referral is generally at the administration stage  Here  you can realistically expect users to advocate for your product   Product Value  Winning at product means thinking about customer value  If you want to learn more about value within product  there s a deck from Jerry Chen  from Greylock Partners where both Reid Hoffman and Josh Elman work  called Unit of Value that s well worth reading  Jerry assesses the Unit of Value of unicorns like Salesforce  Dropbox or Docker  Then  he demonstrates how they deliver  and leverage that value across their service   Products are  value delivery vehicles   If you re developing a new product  or have an idea for one  the fundamental question you need to answer is  what is the Unit of Value this will deliver  The answer will cut across how you price  scale and sell the product  Acquisition tactics communicate the promise of that value  Onboarding needs to demonstrate that value  The delivery of value occurs in the core task completion  Administration concerns the extension of value  It helps users get more value  It s also where you can upsell additional products   Once you understand your product s Unit of Value  it s easier to evolve it  Prioritising a long list of development requests is fundamental to the Product Manager role  I ve found this 2 2 grid  known as the impact effort grid  to be an effective tool for prioritisation within these vectors  Hunter Walk  who was Head of Product at YouTube  is a well known advocate  as are the team at Intercom   To warrant consideration  all roadmap items should be in the upper half of the impact grid  If an item won t help deliver your Unit of Value  it shouldn t even be there  Strategic themes should be in the top right quadrant  In populating this grid with key stakeholders  Product Managers achieve a shared understanding of what the Product Team should  and should not  be doing   By way of example  below is the 2017 roadmap for a product I worked on called Newsmart  a business English learning product that leverages content from The Wall Street Journal   Any given product s Version 1 0 will consist of just the task completion pillar  Nobody starts by building onboarding  This is just a route into the core product  To productise means to work outwards from this pillar and add the additional pillars  Productisation means establishing how people will find your product  understand what it is  use it  then customise it   In the B2B space  there s an additional level of complexity as buyers and users are different people A buyer s Unit of Value can be very different from that of the user  It s easy to relentlessly improve the end user experience and overlook the needs of the buyer  the person who ll ultimately decide whether or not to invest in you  Products need to demonstrate and deliver value to each simultaneously   Whereas the administration pillar is rarely given much thought in consumer products  in B2B it s one of the most important elements  How does a buyer evaluate whether they re getting return on their investment  Usually via a dashboard or via reports which tell them whether users are engaging with the product  and for how long  With Newsmart  we overlooked the significance of this for far too long  We realised very late the importance of developing an administration suite that meant buyers could see value  not just users   Products that start in the consumer space and pivot into the enterprise enter a very different realm  How you communicate and market changes  You don t need to convince a single person anymore  You need to convince a variety of stakeholders  Succeeding in the enterprise means passing through a lot of barriers  Slack recently announced a partnership with Google s G Suite  That indicates  to me  that even they ve been wrestling with this problem  They ve got good traction with end users  but are struggling to get their enterprise product into the market and recognise that Google are further down the track   Product Design Patterns  If you examine the four pillars  the discussion around each is fairly advanced  Design patterns have been established that can be lifted and shifted into your own product  There s no need to reinvent the wheel or go through the same learning curve each time   As an example  let s look at onboarding  Interesting characters exist  like Samuel Hulick  He s established a whole business around this called User Onboard  His speciality is the  teardown   Teardowns evaluate the onboarding of different products and break out the good and bad points of each  Product Managers can go to User Onboard and quickly understand best practice for different products across a number of verticals   Central to onboarding is the concept of the  Aha   moment  Aha  is when the user understands the value of a product and how it s relevant to them  Succeeding at onboarding means getting users to the  Aha   moment as quickly as possible  As competition for user attention increases  time to Aha  needs to shorten   Again  Chamath Palihapitiya is a great reference point  Chamath was head of the Growth Team at Facebook between 2008 and 2012  He s very direct  often abrasive  in the way he communicates  This comes across in this classic talk on YouTube in which he rejects outright much of the pseudoscience about growth and  growth hacking   For him  growth is all about understanding your product s Unit of Value   If anyone is sceptical about the importance of onboarding  I would cite Twitter as a great example of what happens if you don t get it right  2016 has not been a good year for Twitter  Business plateaued  growth fell off a cliff and its share price continued to flatline   The heart of the problem is a failure to communicate their Unit of Value  Too many people still don t understand Twitter  what it does  and why they should use it  That s a failure of marketing and a failure of onboarding  A very high percentage of people register but never tweet or follow anyone  Failure to progress to these stages means you never reach the  Aha   moment  If you don t reach Aha   you don t understand the value  If you don t understand the value  you ll churn   To explore this further  let s look at a successful example of onboarding  The reason I chose x ai s Amy is that she is fundamentally a piece of technology  not a product  Considerable resource was spent developing the AI and decisioning engine  When it moved into the market  it could have been taken in a number of directions   x ai made a number of choices that  I think  were brilliant from a product perspective  Amy s onboarding is simple but effective  Once you ve signed up  she emails you and says   Hi  I m your personal assistant  great to be on board   then asks you to take a couple of actions  All of us receive and respond to email requests  So  the interaction is familiar   If you examine the first onboarding emails from Amy  she clearly states the value proposition  The  magic   she says   happens after 13 meetings   To demonstrate the value proposition  she schedules the first meeting with you  She sends an invite and asks   Could you add a meeting reminder for this coming Thursday   By accepting the meeting  and seeing it drop into your calendar  you understand the value  There s the  Aha   moment right there  All of a sudden  Amy has gone from being something novel and strange to something familiar  It s a design pattern that everybody understands   Amy could easily have remained a technology that schedules your meetings  In productising it  x ai assessed our mental models and leveraged something known instead of introducing something alien   Core task completion for Amy occurs in threads of emails between her and a variety of recipients  In these exchanges  she co ordinates different calendars and  eventually  schedules a meeting   In terms of administration  individual preferences for Amy are key  Most of us don t want meetings at nine o clock on a Sunday morning  I try and schedule most of my face to face meetings in the mornings  to leave the afternoons free  and my settings reflect this  Preferences change over time  of course  As settings are updated  Amy emails you to confirm   For me  Amy is an excellent  contemporary example of productisation  The Unit of Value is time saved  Amy calculates this based on your usage and sends updates which outline how many hours she s saved you each month  This can amount to dozens of hours saved annually   Payment  At some point  most products will take payment from users  This is another step that s frequently overlooked  Design patterns for this are well developed too  A lot of research exists on  choice architecture  and the presentation of payment plans   It s also worth evaluating the extent to which your target users are able to pay  At Newsmart  we were predominantly selling into Asia We launched with support for PayPal and credit cards via Stripe  Over time  a consistent message we heard from users was   I want to pay  but I can t   Our ignorance about preferred means of payment in China  Taiwan and Korea meant we were very slow to adopt certain methods   If you re Chinese  Alipay is probably you re preferred method of online payment  UnionPay is also popular and PayPal is nowhere  Make sure you research the penetration of credit cards in your target markets  In many countries  outside the US  it s very low   less than 50 per cent  If you re not supporting preferred local payments  you re leaving a lot of money on the table  Users might want to pay but can t   The Hook Model  As user psychology is essential to effective productisation  a design paradigm worth understanding is Nir Eyal s  hooked model   A student of BJ Fogg  Nir draws on Fogg s theories of behaviour  These regard behaviour as the outcome of motivation  ability and trigger  Nir has researched the common elements of  ultra sticky  products   In his view  Facebook  Snapchat  WhatsApp  even LinkedIn  perfectly create the factors that effect behaviour change   The stickiest products are the ones that nail the motivation and trigger moments  If the product is an app  the trigger will likely be a notification that says to the user   Something is going on here  you re missing out   Notice that notifications always pull you into the product  If you get an email from Facebook  there ll be a call to action that takes you into the product  In Nir s model  the most powerful motivator is known as  variable reward   Psychologically  this is more addictive than crack   Variability injects an element of the unknown into the product experience  This generates a sense of FOMO that compels the user to take action  A combination of trigger and variable reward is what causes us to compulsively check Snapchat and Facebook  FOMO is also what prevents us from leaving the platform  How often have you heard someone declare they re sick of Facebook and plan to stop using it  But no one ever does   Productise   In summary  If you want to build a product  not just a piece of technology  start by thinking about value  Once you understand the value you provide  think about how you communicate  demonstrate and deliver it  Be mindful of the degree of familiarity users have with your product  And never lose sight of the outcomes they re trying to achieve    This post has been adapted from a talk I gave recently at TechCity in London  You can find the slidedeck from the session on Slideshare here,"[427 1239 222 709 999 23 1282 1214 1253 244 1164]"

idea and you present it to someone  and they immediately like it with no reservations  it s not a good idea     Tom Blondi  Chief Revenue Officer  SocialWhirled   Your first users are the most important ones  However  failing to make a positive first impression with your initial customers can seriously hinder the success of your product  and many startups don t always get a second chance to release a better version of their offering   Luckily  we here at the Founder Institute have collected insights from top industry experts into a comprehensive guide to help you get valuable user feedback before you launch your product to ensure that the product you release is the strongest it can be   For more information on customer and product development  check out our blog post   How to Have Your Customer Build Your Product for You    Devise Your Game Plan  Before you begin collecting user feedback on your potential product  there are several things you must keep in mind  In the Bitcatcha blog post  UX Design Part 2  How To Define Your Users  Find them   Solve Their Problems   Daren Low recommends clearly defining who your target customers are and what they want in five steps   1  Finalize Your Company s Value Proposition  Your company must have a clearly defined value proposition  as this is what will attract  or turn away  your potential users  Remember  if you can describe what your product is and why it s valuable in five seconds or less  you re on the right track   2  Define Your Customers  Biggest Need  Before you test your product among test users  ensure that your product actually solves a problem or fills a gap in your respective market  as this will be the metric you use to measure the performance of your company s offering   3  Create Your Ideal Customer s User Profile  Avoid generalizations when defining your ideal consumer  Try to see your perfect customer as a real human being rather than a graph  table  or percentage   4  List Your Ideal Customers  Demographics  Tabulate the demographics of your customer base  Include the age  gender  location  occupation  income  and any more relevant details that pertain to your ideal customer   5  Pinpoint Your Ideal Customers  Motivations  Aspirations  and Goals  Your product will have a more lasting impact on your customers if it s designed not only for who they are  but who they want to be  In addition to the above characteristics of your ideal user  make a list of their motivations  their reasons for coming investing in your product  what they are passionate about  etc   Now that you have a clear understanding of who your product is for and what their needs are  there are just a couple of more things you must do before you start collecting feedback  In Yu Sheng s ICX blog post   5 Tips to Get the Most Out of User Feedback   it s recommended that founders determine what kind of feedback they want and begin the process by accepting that users are always right   Believe it or not  there are different kinds of feedback to get on a product  Here are a few different types of feedback you may want  depending on what your product is   If you want general feedback on your product  then it is acceptable to merely seek general improvements   If you want validation on your product idea  then you should determine if your product satisfies a need or solves a problem for your target market   If you are concerned with the usability of your product  then you should focus your feedback acquisition on aspects like ease of use  understandability  intuitiveness of flows actions  etc   While not every piece of feedback you get on your product will be relevant to you  it is essential to assume that your customers are right  as founders often have the tendency to be defensive about their company s offering  For example  if one of your users has trouble understanding how your product functions  it s easy assume that that person is an idiot  However  keeping an open mind when collecting feedback will enable you to catch a product flaw that other users may be experiencing  as well  Identifying your product s glitches before launching your product may very well increase your chances of success   Collect User Feedback  There are a variety of tactics that you can use to collect user feedback  each of which will produce different results  so be sure to experiment and discover the ones that work best for you  Marketing Analyst Lars Lofgren outlines several of the most popular and effective methods for getting quality feedback from users in the KISSmetrics blog post  The 5 Best Ways to Get Feedback from Your Customers    Surveys  Countless companies employ surveys to get feedback because of their simplicity and versatility  Here are a few tips to get the most out of your surveys   Keep surveys short   5 10 questions is an acceptable length for surveys   Only employ questions that you ll actually use  Every question should serve a purpose  so if you ask an unimportant question  you re wasting your time and the user s time   Use open ended questions to obtain more accurate information from your users  Using rating scales and multiple choice questions will restrict the types of answers you will receive and limit the quality of the data   If you decide to utilize surveys to collect user feedback  here is a list of survey service options that worth looking into  many of which are inexpensive or free for those of you with limited budgets   The Direct Approach  One of the most effective ways of getting useful feedback is to reach out directly to your early users  Talk to them through email  on the phone  or  even better  find which ones are local and offer to take them out to lunch or coffee to discuss your product  While time commitments may make this method tricky  it can also save you the most time in the long run  as an hour of getting raw  direct  honest feedback is more valuable than a hundred customer surveys   If you plan to reach out to your customers through email  check out Justin Wilcox s blog post   Getting Customer Interviews with Cold Emails    Whether you communicate with your test users through email  by phone  or in person  asking the right questions will greatly increase your chances of acquiring useful feedback  Product Researcher Emma Meehan listed out a multitude of questions to ask your test users in the Intercom blog post   The Right Questions Get Actionable Answers   Here are some of the most effective below    What works well about X     What s confusing  if anything  about it     What could we improve     What has your impression of  feature X  been so far     Explain what you think the product does     What do you think the difference is between  feature X  and  feature Y     A useful tool for interviewing customers is the  Customer Interview Script Generator   developed by Justin Wilcox to provide you with a custom script for any kind of customer interview   Usability Tests  Conducting usability tests is a powerful means of getting feedback on your offering  as this will alert you to what features your user is drawn to  what catches their attention  where they get confused  and more  If you have an app  software  or website you want feedback on  there are numerous services that will document the user s process  Here are a few services that can help you manage and conduct usability tests  many of them free   However  if you lack the funds to invest in a service  there is another option to get quality user feedback  Find member of your target demographic  e g  parents  young adults  elderly people  millenials  etc   and schedule a time to meet with them  Give them a sample of your product and give them a simple task to complete with no guidance and just watch them figure it out  If they have trouble completing the task  take note as this may be a problem that others from your demographic may experience as well  Also  do not do this with friends with family as they may give you biased feedback  when what you need is complete honesty  ideally from a complete stranger   What to Do with Your Feedback  Once you ve collected a sizeable amount of user feedback  you must analyze it for important insights and determine the best course of action for your product  Here are some more insights from Yu Sheng s  5 Tips to Get the Most Out of User Feedback    Determine Your Users  Pain Points  If your users had trouble understanding how your product works or experienced confusion navigating its features  take the time to explore the pain points of your users  Whichever method you employ to gather feedback  be sure to address the following points   If you gave your user a set of instructions  were the instructions hard to understand   Did the product meet the user s expectations   What was the user expecting when they were first given the product   The easiest way to get answers to these questions is to just ask  However  if you do not have the users readily available to interview  include these questions in your surveys or any other method of collecting feedback   Scrutinize Your Feedback  Some types of feedback are more valuable than others  For example  if the feedback on your product is generally positive  this may be a good indicator that your product is on the road to launch  However  if the few negative reviews you get come from users who are closer to your target demographic  this feedback is more important than the multitude of positive reviews you ve received from general reviewers   Bottom line  carefully analyze not only the feedback you ve collected  but also the source of the feedback  as this will reveal more important insights than you think   Test the Improved Version  After closely analyzing the feedback you ve collected so far  it s time to implement changes to your product based on what your early users suggested and test the improved version for further feedback  You may need repeat this process several times  as users often don t know what they want from your product or may have trouble articulating what they want   While this may end up being a long and repetitive endeavor  keep in mind that constantly updating and improving your product before you officially launch will prevent you from releasing a lackluster offering that fails to attract users   Final Thoughts  As you endeavor to build the perfect product  keep in mind that receiving feedback and improving your product is a constant process and should be an important part of your company s model  And remember  sometimes even the harshest criticism can be the most valuable advice   I think it s very important to have a feedback loop  where you re constantly thinking about what you ve done and how you could be doing it better  I think that s the single best piece of advice  constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself     Elon Musk   Icons of people with speech bubbles image

experimentation oriented approach   They were also in the early innings of building institutional knowledge around consistent user acquisition  Rothenberg  an expert on silver linings  as most growth aficionados are  saw a greenfield  One of the first things he did was help found a small  cross functional  growth obsessed strike team  Together  they accumulated many wins  losses  and learnings along the way as Eventbrite scaled to become the world s largest self service ticketing platform   Recently  he came to First Round to field founder questions about growth  driving conversions  product instrumentation and more  He was able to draw on experience not just from his tenure at Eventbrite  but also from multiplying TaskRabbit s business 3x as co head of marketing  building his own First Round Capital backed startup SkillSlate before that  and starting his career as a growth oriented product manager  What follows is a selection of the hardest questions Rothenberg gets asked all the time  and his solutions for reaching more users  capturing more value  and making sure the best come back   My startup is on the early side of early stage  How should we be thinking about growth    There s a saying that there are only two phases in a company s life  pre product market fit and post product market fit  and I m a firm believer in that   says Rothenberg   If you re pre product market fit then  seriously  you don t want to be focusing on growth  A huge mistake people make all the time is trying to find a magic bullet growth solution that will prove they re on the right track  but that doesn t exist  Or if it does  it s a spam tactic that won t work for very long and will only do more harm in the long run    Resources shouldn t be dedicated to growth if your product isn t on a clear path to sustainable user engagement and value creation  Everything you have and everything you do should be about finding that fit first  making sure there s a real tangible need for your solution  reaching out and really talking to your initial customers to iterate fast    Growth expert Sean Ellis  CEO of GrowthHackers  says you should survey your user base before doing growth work  At least 40  of your users should say they would be very disappointed if your service or product went away overnight   Rothenberg says   If they don t  then you likely don t have solid product market fit  Hitting that mark is a sign you ve found your niche  And then it becomes all about pouring fuel   in the form of dollars or resources  of course   on growth tactics to hopefully return even more users and dollars    Importantly  the trigger metric here is engagement   a blend of healthy traffic  activity and retention  Startups are prone to taking only the first two as a green light  and getting blind sided when they discover they have a leaky bucket on their hands  This is why he recommends that early stage growth and marketing teams focus the bulk of their efforts on customer acquisition  but regularly check in on the rest of their funnel  On a basic level this looks like   Traffic   Sign ups   Key conversion event   Engagement   Retention   Evangelism  You can see why these initial responsibilities belong to marketing  Outside of core product experience  it s difficult to meaningfully impact retention in a way that actually moves your business until you have a large enough customer base period  Rothenberg points out  Early on  most of your energy should go into awareness building and organic acquisition  press hits  brand building  SEO  social  email  and testing paid acquisition channels  Retention is a little stickier to measure  but you need to have some sense of churn so you don t commit to a faulty strategy  This becomes critical as the business scales  and revenue from past customer cohorts grows  If all signs are positive  then it s time to sprint   What can be shocking is how fast you need to shift into growth mode after this happens  Not only do you have to refocus on driving acquisition and conversion  you also have to rapidly scale the team responsible for it  Knowing that with the right product  this fast switch will occur  is half the battle  That way you can have a basic plan in place  ready to implement   a sort of  break in case of product market fit  toolset behind glass   This begs the question  what if you only have two or three people to work on this to start    You have to get ruthless about prioritization   says Rothenberg   Everyone needs to only be working on the small handful of things that will drive the bulk of the impact  The essence of strategy is deciding what to say  no  to  and whoever is managing the team should help to identify those things  and provide air cover on everything that falls outside their reports  critical initiatives   Sometimes this will be the head of marketing  sometimes it will be a founder  Here are a few ways he s learned to work smarter  not just harder in these  small team in a bunker  situations   Ask yourself   What s our business  unfair advantage   Identify and lean into to your unique strengths rather than trying to do everything    Doing what your competition is doing  just better or harder  rarely leads to winning a market  You have to find ways to do things differently    Build out a backlog of everything you think is worth testing and which key metric you expect it to move  Then rate each based on 1  expected effort  2  expected impact  3  probability of success  and 4  dependencies  Here are some examples  using hypothetical data to demonstrate the method    TEST  A B test levers to improve conversion rate of signups for key conversion events   METRIC  Sign up to purchase rate   EXPECTED EFFORT  Low   EXPECTED IMPACT  High   DEPENDENCIES  None   TEST  Effectiveness of lookalike ads  ads targeted at new customer bases that look like your existing audience    METRIC  Volume and ROI of signups   EXPECTED EFFORT  Low   EXPECTED IMPACT  Medium   DEPENDENCIES  None   TEST  Retargeting ads designed to get people who visit your site to sign up   METRIC  Volume and ROI of signups   EXPECTED EFFORT  Medium   EXPECTED IMPACT  Medium   DEPENDENCIES  Design for ad creative   TEST  A B test adding social proof language to key landing pages to increase sign ups   METRIC  Landing page visit to signup conversion rate   EXPECTED EFFORT  High   EXPECTED IMPACT  Low   DEPENDENCIES  Engineering to implement  analytics to track  Spot patterns in your actions   inventory the low to medium effort levers that have medium to high impact and zero or few dependencies   Not being dependent on engineering or other scarce resources within the organization to help you build experiments is a big one    Prioritize these levers first but don t forget to tee up high impact initiatives that do require working with other teams now   They take time to develop  and you can nudge the ball forward as you do other things   Document your force ranked list of priorities and tests and run it by your boss or best sounding board weekly  Be willing to move things around   Always have a  water line  in mind   what you can realistically get done in the next week or month  Circulate this to the whole team  Don t over extend   Working quickly on the things that matter most and are largely within your control to execute can get you pretty far  but soon you ll need to think about growing your growth strategy  The other thing you can do is pick out the few people in your org who have been the most valuable for executing your current plan  Help them spread their habits to other members of their teams  Empower them to be evangelists for the way they work  helping to instill the growth mindset throughout the organization   Brian Rothenberg  Okay  I m ready to build out a team  What now   First  the best growth teams are built at companies where the mandate and interest comes from top leadership  At Twitter  Dick Costolo was known for giving the growth team permission to rock the boat  At Eventbrite  Kevin Hartz was immediately open and supportive of building a cross functional growth task force  The best structure is extremely dependent upon the type of business  and what works best in practice within each unique organization  largely contingent on the talent you have on board since growth talent is so hard to hire   Second  it doesn t have to be a big team   At Eventbrite  growth efforts are spread throughout the org  with deep cross functional work between product  marketing  engineering  analytics  and other groups  Rothenberg s initial cross functional strike team started with one person  him  from marketing  a product manager  a couple engineers  plus shared analytics  UX and design resources  This group was solely dedicated to user growth for a trial period   that s how the team got buy in from executive leadership  It led to faster iteration and learning  and quickly became a fixture  The key  they found  was to empower a very narrow focus on not just broadly helping to grow the company  but on a specific growth goal   Carve out resources that have a sole charter around growth  and know exactly which metrics they should be moving   In Rothenberg s case  this team was first committed to growing the supply side of Eventbrite s business  A key initial mission was to test how to convert more event attendees into event organizers who would use the platform for ticketing  This came about through the team identifying one of their built in  unfair advantages    Early on  Eventbrite gained momentum through the virality of event organizers inviting attendees to their events  After attendees bought tickets  these same people learned that they could use the platform to help organize their own events  This solved early customers  pain points around their previously inefficient methods such as pen and paper  spreadsheets  collecting cash and checks  etc  More new event organizers invited more new event attendees  which triggered exponential growth   With a core service that solved a genuine problem for organizers of all shapes and sizes  the growth team believed they could optimize this built in viral lever to further drive near zero cost customer acquisition  Through a multitude of tests and optimizations  these efforts ratcheted up conversions dramatically which helped to cement the case for a more permanent cross functional growth team   Much of what was tried  Rothenberg drew from prior experience   At TaskRabbit in 2012  Rothenberg oversaw acquisition and retention marketing   but again  there was no formal growth team  Instead  he worked closely with product and engineering on ad hoc efforts to run experiments  In one instance  the acquisition marketing team partnered with engineering to build custom SEM landing page that dynamically updated page content based on the keyword used in searches  The idea was that this might improve conversion  So  for example  if someone searched  house cleaner   they d presumably load a page that would serve up potential house cleaners   as if by magic    We tested our way into this  starting with one landing page  which we then split out into four more tailored versions  each focused on TaskRabbit s most popular service categories   says Rothenberg  As you might expect  the tailored versions of the landing page converted better   Seeing these results  they then split those four landing pages into even more tailored versions for subcategories  Again  conversion upticked  So they leaned in hard  Investing even more in their work with engineering  they built out granular smart landing pages that would detect nuanced ideas like  spring house cleaning NYC   This would also automatically update key content on the page to make the experience more relevant for every visitor    This helped us improve conversion through the long tail of relevant searches  ultimately driving our new customer acquisition   Rothenberg says  Working together  marketing and engineering had produced better business results than either function had working independently   Growth is best driven through tight alignment and coordination between marketing  product  engineering and analytics   This was a tweak and definite improvement upon what he d learned at his own startup SkillSlate in its early days  Striving to build the first local marketplace for independent service providers  think nannies  cleaners  plumbers   they knew there was an incredible long tail of one to two person businesses out there that basically drove all their business through word of mouth  Most of them didn t even have websites  But to succeed  SkillSlate needed to build a credible marketplace that would balance supply  these service professionals  and demand   The team decided to focus on supply first  and they knew they needed to take a novel approach in order to have any chance at all  Interestingly  the founders had the makings of a nascent growth team  with expertise in product  engineering  analytics and marketing accounted for  They just needed to figure out how to move in unison   Their first idea was to solve a critical need for service providers   namely  their discoverability  But that was going to be expensive  when really they needed to onboard supply at next to no cost  after all  they had no paying customers yet  and attracting them would take time    What they did was build a web crawler that aggregated thousands of existing classified ads in one database  Then they scraped them for identifying info like phone numbers and email addresses  All the ads with the same data on them were lumped together and labeled the same business  allowing SkillSlate to use all that language together to describe what the person did  With the help of Mechanical Turk  they were able to turn these unstructured ads into much more cogent business listing with extra info like neighborhoods served  hours of operation  etc   By publishing these listings to the internet  they essentially created the first website or web presence for many of the service providers they wanted to recruit into the marketplace  More importantly  it made their info sticky on Google  giving them better placement in search results  and driving better business    After we had all this  we were able to reach out to service providers to  claim  these business listings in order to edit what we had put together and append customer testimonials   says Rothenberg   Many of them even stumbled on their own listings through Google before we got to them  This led to us acquiring several thousand providers almost immediately after we launched    While this cross functional   one might even say  hacky  approach   worked to drive initial growth  it came at a cost  The system took longer to build than anticipated  and the team over indexed on growth and scale at the expense of devoting our limited resources to solving customer pain points   We had a really smart way to get people into our funnel on the supply side  but we didn t use our runway wisely enough in driving hard toward product market fit   says Rothenberg   To be honest  we missed the mark  I remember meeting with one of our investors who suggested we were trying to scale our way out of the product s lack of engagement  In hindsight  he was 100  right    SkillSlate landed a pretty plumb acquisition deal anyway when it joined TaskRabbit  but he continues to wonder how the business would have thrived had they answered the product fit question before rising to the challenge of scaling   Looking back  there are a few things Rothenberg learned from all of his experiences   Don t try to scale too soon   When I was working on my own startup  we tried to scale before having true product market fit  We tried to brute force our way through rather than focus on core user value and engagement  it was a huge error    Don t run growth independently through a single traditional functional group like marketing or product alone  You need folks with different skill sets and available levers working together and dedicated to the cause   Always align your organization with the few key metrics everyone should rally around  Each person s individual goals should directly ladder up to at least one of these metrics   Realize that every business is different  There s not going to be a one size fits all formula  Tailor these tactics to your market  but always drive hard toward simplicity  It s really easy to overcomplicate growth efforts  Start with straightforward targets  Explain experiments clearly so that everyone can understand them  When you report results  make sure they make sense to everyone and lead to specific  logical actions   Cool  Things are happening  But how do I know if we re making progress   Reporting growth results can be tricky because not everyone will care about the same things  even if you share the same metrics  It also makes a huge difference if you re a B2B or B2C company   For instance  if you re B2B focused   The big idea is to provide real time data on lead lifecycle stages and be able to track that efficiently   says Rothenberg   If nothing else  you want to report on volume and conversion rates between each stage of your funnel    Distill and circulate how close you are to meeting your monthly  quarterly and annual goals for these numbers and conversion rates    These metrics are important because they provide you with insight into your strengths and shortcomings so you can pivot your marketing plans   he says   You also want to track these conversions on a campaign basis so you can see what types of campaigns are the best for generating and or converting different types of leads   Some terminology is helpful here   Leads   Prospects who express very basic interest  such as signing up for your product or filling out a lead form on a piece of content   Marketing Qualified Leads  MQLs   Prospects who express much deeper interest  metaphorically  raising a hand  to be contacted  This is often based on the quantity and types of content they have consumed  or actions they have taken such as watching a recorded product demo and or viewing your pricing page   Sales Qualified Leads  SQLs   Prospects who have been reached out to  researched and vetted by your sales team   Opportunities  Prospects that are in active discussions with your sales team and are one step away from becoming customers   You want to first convert your MQLs and SQLs into opportunities  for instance    All four should be monitored in any B2B growth plan  Let s say you re 75  to your MQL goal  10  to your SQL goal and 50  to your opportunity goal  You ll know from just looking at these numbers that you likely need to spend your time pumping up your MQL to SQL conversion  or figuring out where your higher value opportunities are coming from  You can then refer to your campaign reporting to decide which type of programs to run that will help you get there   When it comes to B2C businesses  what works tends to vary more  To illustrate some tactics  Rothenberg cites an example of a marketplace businesses   Marketplaces tend to have a North Star metric of Gross Merchandise Value  GMV    the value of all goods and services transacted on the platform  This metric has several inputs and funnels   Supply side  Traffic   Number of registered sellers   Number of goods listed   Number of goods sold   Avg selling price   GMV  Demand side  Traffic   Number of buyers   Number of items bought   Avg selling price   GMV  To get to transactional revenue  the largest source of revenue for a marketplace   you typically multiply your GMV by your take rate  your service fee    So  for a marketplace  the high level things you d care about are  how much supply and demand you have  within geographic areas like cities  or within categories like books  electronics  etc    This leads you to care deeply about how many of your items sell and how quickly  and how efficiently you re matching supply and demand  or your liquidity    Once you have a basic equation for both the supply and demand sides of the marketplace  you should map your metrics for each  You ll likely identify areas that are more or less healthy than others   From a high level  it may seem like you have enough supply  but you need to drive more demand  If you go a level deeper  the reality could be that you have twice the supply you need in a given category  but half of what you need in another  Identifying and balancing these situations will help you drive liquidity  Going deeper still  you might see that you have healthy traffic and signups  but your conversion to goods listed is low  This can help you know where to invest more time  money and effort to drive everything else up   The progress you re making on your plan needs to be monitored constantly    Campaign reports are best if updated weekly and distributed to the internal marketing team   says Rothenberg  who recommends adding gauge charts to your CRM to get at a glance insights   This will allow you to make mini pivots in your strategy backed up by data    On a monthly basis  compile the progress you ve made against your plan  key learnings and key challenges  and share that report with sales  he says  Briefly bullet out the campaigns you plan to run over the next month based on these lessons  This will keep communication healthy  and hold you accountable to constantly improve   It s easy to get too granular in your reporting   which wastes time  For example  open and clickthrough rates on emails can be helpful for the right people on the marketing team to optimize what they re doing  But they re not helpful for broader funnel analysis  Rothenberg says  They don t need to be passed along to other teams    Everyone who needs to know real time data should have access to the right dashboards in your CRM   he says   But we don t send out too many reports to people via email  We make a point of covering the key ones in weekly  monthly and quarterly meetings so we can provide the necessary commentary and break down complex topics in real time  We don t want to just show people numbers  we want to describe what the numbers are telling us and discuss what we re doing about it    Keep in mind that setting the wrong goals can be worse than setting no goals at all  Sure  this runs counter to the analytical growth approach  but wrong goals can really do some damage  People s nature is to drive toward targets  But if these targets aren t aligned with what truly drives a desired outcome  then everything can break apart   Early on  before you know what drives your business with great precision  it s very helpful to be flexible on your targets and to regularly adjust and reforecast at regular intervals along the way   This is an ongoing process for us at Eventbrite   says Rothenberg   We re always gaining new understanding of our business levers and how we can work smarter toward what will actually drive results for our customers first  and then our business    What tools do you use to do your funnel analysis  And how do you act on the results    When working with early stage companies  I typically use some combination of third party tools like Google Analytics for traffic analysis  Mixpanel to visualize funnels and Optimizely for A B tests   Rothenberg says   These tools tend to work well when the business is ramping up  though during scale stage most companies begin to rely more heavily on internally built tools  such as a proprietary A B testing platform  which are made possible as the business scales and its needs change    You also want to spend time calculating the unit economics of your business  What is the value of each user  How is that trending over time  How much should you be spending to scale users   It s vital that you understand the relationship between customer acquisition costs  CAC  and customer lifetime value  CLV or LTV for lifetime value  for your business  This is how you ll ensure that user acquisition is profitable    At the earliest stage of a startup  you re just trying to acquire enough users to get to product market fit and see if the unit economics are going to work   says Rothenberg   You want to keep it relatively simple at the stage  including direct spend and things like promotions    The goal is to be directionally in bounds when spend is low to figure out which channels will yield profitable acquisition   At scale  CLV should include almost everything  headcount  direct marketing spend  branding spend  discounts and promotions  and more  Take into account company overhead  your lease  support functions  cost to service recurring revenue  etc in order to get to your true gross margin LTV  The simple equation is   CLV    Revenue per User   Gross Margin      Customer Churn Rate  You really want to dig deep here to make sure what you re doing will pay off long term    A common mistake that I see startups making is that they calculate CLV once and think it s set in stone   says Rothenberg   As acquisition scales outside of early adopters  nearly all businesses eventually acquire lower value users  This degrades CLV and can lead to an upside down situation where CLV ends up being lower than CAC    Make sure to update your CLV estimates at a regular cadence  quarterly or bi annually to start  to make sure you re not spending more than you re getting from each incremental user   It sounds obvious  but many companies fall prey to this  and scaling negative unit economics is a quick path in the wrong direction   he says   Keep peeling the onion to understand the unique drivers and metrics of your business  Track those obsessively    Conversion is a lever to push on every day   he says   Over my career  I have run hundreds of A B tests on key landing pages and user flows in order to continually iterate and understand what improves conversion all the way from signup to the bottom of the funnel  As you scale  your highest leverage tends to be deeper in the funnel  I have repeatedly seen how some of the biggest  most overlooked opportunities are deeper in the funnel    For example  at TaskRabbit  his team ran a number of tests throughout their funnel and found that the biggest impact came from improving the match rate between people posting tasks and the taskers actually doing them  With this hypothesis  they made product changes to increase the number of successful connections  and the results weren t surprising  This ultimately led to the company s pivot away from customer bidding to on demand service  which quadrupled the company s revenues    Credit goes to the team there after I left  but it s a prime example of a business figuring out what really matters  running experiments in that area  and then quickly incorporating those learnings into its core product   says Rothenberg   The business taking off after those changes really spoke for itself    As a business scales  it becomes increasingly vital to not only focus on filling the top of the funnel and moving customers through  but on how you engage and retain those customers   The larger the percentage of your revenue coming from returning customers  the bigger the opportunity becomes to positively impact your overall revenue through modest gains in your returning customer base   says Rothenberg   This can be a very difficult lever to move  but it starts with understanding why your most valuable customers stay with you  and conversely  why some of them leave   You have to nail that shift from focusing on sheer growth to full engagement  Making it too late is a costly mistake   Photography by Bonnie Rae Mills,"[442 494 365 549 881 1188 916 1036 1253 705 348]"

not a dirty word   Remind yourself of this  a sales team  by any other name  is still a group of individuals focused on acquiring and accelerating new revenue for the company  In product led businesses  this often takes the form of customer experience  customer support and   or customer success  When approached in the right way  layering in a human sales effort into your product led business can accelerate growth while maintaining envy worthy unit economics   But what should sales look like in a product led company  The fundamentals of sales remain the same   it s all about engaging the right people  at the right time  with relevant information  But the who  when  and how have to adapt to support a product led business   Who  You re generating hundreds  maybe thousands of leads and creating great buzz  but are you attracting the right customers  You should consider three things here   Target market segment is as important as ever  Do you understand your ideal buyer  It s more than LTV and CAC   it s important to understand how you stack up against your competition  relative deal size  speed of adoption and the value you deliver to the end user  Any sales and marketing tactics you do employ should be targeted at this segment  Your product is a lead gen tool  A free product  should you choose to employ this PLG pricing technique  is offered to show value and build credibility as part of the sales process  but every lead is not created equal  neither is every customer  Leverage your knowledge of your ideal customer profile to point your resources at the right trial and   or free product leads and use your product to help identify those people  Let them come to you  Steer clear of traditional high activity  dial for dollars  inside sales plays  Cold calling is not for your business  You have users in your product who will naturally hand raise   they will want help  to have a question answered  or request a new feature  Align your resources to supporting these engaged users and moving them further through your funnel   When  You don t have infinite resources  so an  early and often  or traditional  swarm  sales approach does not work  Instead  you need to make every interaction count  There are three places to focus the time of your  sales  team   Support  Provide an exceptional customer experience from the first time they touch your product  Put SLAs in place for response time  ensure that every question is answered quickly and issues are resolved to offer a frictionless product experience  These are not quota hungry salespeople  but helpers and product evangelists who are educating your users and the market Conversion  The fastest way to move the needle is to get more out of the leads you re already generating  Review your entire funnel for opportunities for 1 1 or 1 many touch points and opportunities to remove drop off points  Examples include  but are not limited to  live chat  public training  FAQs  minimizing setup time  mobile experience and more  Retention  This is really about adoption  Don t wait until you see signs of churn  spend time in the first few days   weeks   months monitoring usage

offering services support in initial setup  extending a referral bonus to enhance your network effect  sharing tips   tricks via automated email touch points and more   How  Repeat after me  less is more  Don t try to engage a buyer in an hour long demo  refrain from pitching in every conversation  resist the urge to over engineer or over complicate interactions  Instead   Employ a bottoms up sale  It s about arming power users with a business case to take to the decision maker  Show value to your end user and make your product core to their everyday activities  By focusing on the end user experience and encouraging them to invite their coworkers in  you extend the network effect and build a base of users that can grow to department and   or company wide adoption  Get your compensation

Be flexible  be nimble and be ready to adapt  What works for an SMB market may not work as deal size grows  If the day comes where you need an experienced enterprise sales team to close 6 figure deals

service call  Internally  they huddled with product  marketing  sales and CX to devise new product offerings that would satisfy   delight  even   the affected users  And in the end  ClassPass emerged with both a more sustainable product offering and a deeper understanding of what its users wanted   For Lord  the only way forward is to fall in love with one process  getting in the mind of your customer  Do that  and even the most public marketing challenge is just an opportunity to make your product better  your team more focused and your users more happy  That tack has served Lord at Classpass  as well as VP of Marketing at home services platform Porch  CMO of loyalty software provider BigDoor and VP of Growth at Moz  previously SEOmoz   an inbound analytics software company   In this exclusive interview  Lord clarifies what product marketing really is  and why founders should consider investing in it sooner rather than later  She shares tactical advice for recruiting  integrating  and establishing the culture of a top notch product marketing team  And she explains why an organization that puts the customer first  in all things  is wielding a little bit of magic   What Product Marketing Is   and Isn t   Product marketing  at its heart  is about understanding what you re building  why you invested in it  and how it will benefit the user   and then messaging that understanding to your customer   says Lord  But if you re not sure how product marketing is different than  marketing marketing   you re not alone   Lord observes that many people primitively define product marketing as the ability to position  but she believes it s so much more than that  She sees the field as an amalgamation of four key tasks  It s helping a company determine   What to build  which typically overlaps with product   Who to build for  which typically overlaps with UX  or business development sales   How to price it  which typically overlap with pricing  marketing  product  or sales   And how to sell it  which overlaps with marketing and sales    Whereas marketing is traditionally about leveraging channels to drive prospects or leads   to get people at the top of the funnel and then move them through it   product marketing is more about helping existing customers understand your products and features and engage with them   Done well  of course  product marketing will drive new users  too  But it s primarily an exercise in communicating with your customers  and helping them understand the full value of everything you build for them   When to Kick start Product Marketing  Because product marketing is fundamentally cross functional  it can be difficult for startups to know when  and how  to integrate it  If you re wondering whether it s time  consider two key questions   How big is your company   How complex is your product portfolio   In a smaller company  it s easier to get customer service  product  marketing and sales on the same page about your products  features and why they re valuable   If you have one product  and it s super early for the company  you could even have someone on your product team  or your marketing team  playing this role 50  of the time   says Lord   Really small early stage start ups might not need a product marketer  because their CEO is the product marketer    On the other axis is your product portfolio  If your products are complicated  think about investing in product marketing early  even if you re a small company   A product or feature can be complicated for many reasons  it might involve a new UX concept  the pricing might scale with usage or it may entail an upfront commitment from the user before it s fully unlocked   says Lord    At ClassPass  we launched our new Home experience for our mobile customers  Its entirely new navigation involved personalized suggestions  upcoming class information and their favorite classes   says Lord   This was a significant shift from our previous  schedule based  interface  We wanted this new experience to convey our commitment to creating a seamless  personalized fitness membership  but that isn t easy to relay in a few touch points    So if you re too close to the product and can t tell if your product or upcoming feature release is complicated  ask yourself these questions   Does this feel like an evolution or a revolution to the current experience   Are you trying to convey a greater shift in strategy or mission with this release   How easy could a customer explain the product or feature to another customer   If you launched this product or feature with absolutely no support or product tips  how easy would it be to understand   Lastly  if you asked your internal teams to explain it to the customer  would they all pitch it intuitively the same way    By asking these questions  you ll see pretty quickly that what feels simple to the teams closest to the product could easily leave the customer confused without the right product marketing strategy behind it   says Lord   After assessing the size of your company and complexity of your product portfolio  you ll land somewhere on this matrix   It s not a question of if you ll need product marketing  but when  As your company matures   as it either grows in size or develops a more complicated product portfolio   the need for someone to focus on messaging and positioning will become clear   You need to have achieved product market fit  of course  Until then  you re still throwing things up against the wall  waiting to see there s really demand for one of your products   says Lord   Beyond that  though  I believe in investing in this early    Product marketing essentially lies between product management and development on one side  and acquisition and retention on the other  As such  product marketers own a number of crucial tasks that otherwise fall into a sort of no man s land  Top among them is competitive research  product marketing is also typically responsible for creating a number of crucial definitions  facts  and taxonomy docs for the company   If you re stitching together value statements to drop into a launch email  it s time to build out product marketing   How to Hire for the Right Skill Set  It s a special hire who can sit at that intersection of building great products and messaging them into the public consciousness  When it s time to invest in a product marketing team  you need to look for a particular combination of hard and soft skills    As you might expect  I ve found that the best product marketers have a combination of marketing and product chops   says Lord  Candidates need to be well versed in topics that don t necessarily fit neatly in a single discipline  ideation  agile development  launching releases  go to market and demand generation  for example  Lord s most successful hires have often started in product and found themselves drawn to marketing   or vice versa   What you re looking for is a respect for both disciplines  Product marketing is not either or  It s absolutely both   she says   Beyond subject matter expertise  there are a few key traits that should be non negotiable when searching for a stellar product marketer   Drawn to details  Product marketing involves a lot of minutiae  and candidates need to manage it all  Keep an eye out for a project management background when you re reviewing resumes  In Lord s experience  a lot of great product marketers come from that world  too   Researches by default   Product marketers have to be data driven and love research  They re spending a lot of their time understanding the market  and helping the company understand how to position itself   says Lord  In person or UX research chops  and more traditional data experience  can be helpful   Fetches feedback  Your product marketers are a voice for your users  and they need to be excited by the challenge of getting into the customer s mindset   They have to have that deep respect for CX and feedback  They have to want to develop something that really serves the customer   says Lord   Identifies as cross functional  Few roles touch more people in your organization than product marketing   Candidates really need to have strong self awareness  but also relationship awareness   If someone can t collaborate well across departments and functions  they won t be able to do the job   It s a lot to look for  but Lord shared some of her favorite interview questions for digging deeper into a candidate s qualifications   What is product marketing  What s your framework for approaching product marketing   The number one thing they need to be able to do is show me a great go to market strategy   she says   That should typically include a checklist that crosses teams  and tasks to be executed before  during  and after release    How do you measure the success of a go to market  Look for specifics here  The answer might focus on driving awareness or adoption  for example  or increasing retention  But whatever the framework  it should have its roots in measurable data   There s a domain to this  There s deep knowledge   says Lord   When someone says   I just love product  I love to help customers understand great products   that s too soft for me    How do you handle ambiguity  How do you handle quick timelines  How do you transfer knowledge through organizations  There are crucial soft skills to product marketing too  though  Leave room in your interview to suss out how the candidate would manage the pressures of startup life or the inevitable challenges of coordinating large numbers of busy colleagues   You may also want to consider a homework assignment  particularly if you re interviewing candidates who have only  unofficial  expertise on one side of the product marketing spectrum   that is  who ve held roles in either marketing or product  but don t have verifiable experience in both   Lord shared a couple of her go to exercises   Here s a made up product  How would you approach defining and positioning it for the market   You re actually looking for them to come back with the questions they would ask   Here are the questions I d ask product  Here are the questions I d ask the executive team  Here are the questions I d ask customers in the focus group     We have this real world product  People are turning off of it quickly  How would we get to the heart of why  In this case  you want candidates to demonstrate that they know how to link all the feedback channels across the company  Moreover  you want them to prove that they re scrappy   They should show you that they understand cancellation surveys  or would put up an on site survey to understand why people bounce  That they would talk to CX to see what they believe is causing the problem  or interview the sales team  which is probably the number one source for understanding friction in the selling process   says Lord   The Fine Art of Launching Product Marketing  Once you ve found the right person   or people   for the job  it s time to integrate them with the rest of your team  Particularly when it comes to onboarding your first product marketer  proceed thoughtfully   there s actually more of an art to it than you might realize   The number one mistake I see is failing to make sure that product managers and marketing managers have a shared definition of what product marketing is    It doesn t matter who you hire  If a product manager feels like someone else is defining their product  or a channel marketer feels that some other person is telling them how to sell  it will fail   says Lord   Sales and CX  too  can feel like their toes are being stepped on when a new function begins to tell them how to talk to the customer  From the get go  though  Lord makes it clear to her marketing orgs that those departments are both their most valuable source of information and their most vulnerable stakeholders   Nothing is closer to the heart of customer confusion than the CX team   she says   We respect that if we fail to do our jobs  they will feel it    Standing up a product marketing organization is an enormous boon for a startup  When customer facing teams can easily share insights with product  and vice versa  the entire company gets on the same page  In many ways  it s a chance to recapture the uniquely collaborative energy of a startup s earliest days   only this time  with a new depth of expertise and process   But if people don t have the same understanding of what s supposed to happen  you end up with a lot of territory grabbing and silo making  For all of the obvious reasons  that s really scary    A successful product marketing organization  then  needs a clear mandate and company wide consensus  Like many other elements of the organization  it also needs a steady  coherent product roadmap    If you bring in a product marketer because you have a great product  but you don t know what you re going to build next  or when or how  this person has nothing to stand on   says Lord   They become a bit more of a project manager at that point  And that s a very expensive project manager    Of course  product marketers themselves also play a crucial role is proving their worth and establishing a team that the rest of the organization respects and values  In Lord s experience  that boils down to open  humble communication   The product marketer has to be an expert at asking questions and understanding both the customer and their internal stakeholder   she says   Making assumptions  on the other hand  is the quickest way to lose internal buy in  And it s an easy mistake to make  Product marketers handle huge amounts of information  both qualitative and quantitative  in many ways  it s only natural to form opinions   If they re prescriptive rather than objective  that s really dangerous  It never works  It tends to  again  cause silos    The key to great product marketing is to remain two things  objective and a team player   Unleash Product Marketing Via Experimentation  One of the best ways to do both is to swap opinions for data driven analysis  In addition to fostering cross departmental collaboration  product marketing teams can and should usher in a culture of experimentation    Product marketing comes down to how you position and message a feature or product   says Lord   Doing that excellently involves a lot of testing   For starters  make A B testing standard practice  with testing software now so affordable  there s no reason not to   Being able to swap out positioning quickly is a huge part of getting signals back  It can help you move quicker and with more confidence    Beyond that  there s no single experiment every startup to run  no rule for how to approach testing  that depends too much on your company s roadmap and relative maturity  But every startup does need to weigh the three key ways to grow a company  acquisition  retention  and monetization  And if you re like most startups  there s a good chance you re weighing them wrong    Most startups over invest in acquisition testing  when they should be researching   and using most of their product marketing team   to understand and affect retention    Another common testing pitfall  Asking questions that are too broad to yield precise  actionable insights   What do you want us to build   or  What s the number one problem you have   The big picture questions you might ask on the road to product market fit are not the same questions you should be asking when it s time to scale  and beyond   Take a common problem Lord sees with cancellation surveys   Many of them are fundamentally flawed because they allow you to answer with something like   I just didn t see the value  or  I just didn t like it    she says   Bring that back to the team  and you ll still be in a dark room shooting darts at all the walls  with no idea what you re doing    To avoid spinning your wheels   and wasting valuable customer time   always be specific in your tests  The rigors of experimentation may bump up against the startup s need for speed  but resist the temptation to rush it  Process is crucial  Identify your thesis and specific goal  the cohort you will be testing against  and how you will execute your test  Then meet regularly with the group that s contributing to the experiment to assess the test itself   The team at ClassPass  for example  believes that the company has something unique to offer in video fitness  They are committed to making product investments in that arena   and to taking the time to make and test hypotheses for what those investments should look like   We re not quite sure what our contribution in this space will be yet  But we have conviction to test our way into it    How Product Marketing Can Usher In a Culture of Product Feedback  Successful product marketing can t exist in a vacuum  though  It requires a commitment from everyone else in the organization to share their insights and be a voice for the customer when the opportunity arises  To start  that might be as simple as requiring every team to send out a weekly report of key findings  test results for the data driven teams  or a summary of the week s highlights and lowlights for teams whose work is more qualitative   You re just trying to bring knowledge  and bring an experimentation first culture   says Lord   But  sharing  means more than disseminating test results  it needs to be part of your company culture   Anyone can walk up to our CPO with an idea or say   This test is showing me X and Y  Who should I connect with on your team to talk about whether or not this could become a feature or a product    It s okay to put parameters on that openness  At ClassPass  a test has to demonstrate that something could yield 1 000 subscribers before it s considered for product development  The goal is simply to empower any team member to spot and share opportunities to improve products   By encouraging an open discussion of ideas  you also  perhaps counter intuitively  make it easier for your team to move on when their ideas don t make it into the pipeline  Lord says the ClassPass encourages a culture of  disagree and commit  and she suggests other startups do the same    Every quarter we do our planning sprints  and anyone can bring their idea and a business case for why it s worthy of investment   she says   When faced with pushback  you can take a last chance to disagree and say   I really think this is the right thing  Look at all those tests I ran   But then if the CPO or product leads look at you and says   I hear you  But now s not the right time   you have to accept that and rally behind the ideas that do move forward    That s not to say it s easy to move on   You are going to have about a thousand things you want to do every day   says Lord   And of those thousand  probably twenty are things that customers  with pain in their eyes  have implored you to tackle  But the reality is that some of them will have to go untouched    And that s okay   as long as you stay customer first   You have to take bigger swings  The right things will hit volume  so you re looking for the ones that will hit the majority of people   says Lord   Those will start to trickle down    Meanwhile  give a loud internal voice to the team that is closest to your users  customer support  This should take the form of an ongoing and open dialogue  but it can also include one off collaborative events   Recently  we did what we called a  slay day   where the entire company supported CX and jumped in to work on help tickets and get them to inbox zero   says Lord   It s one of the best thing we ve ever done  Engineers  product managers  and marketing all came out of that day obsessed with solving problems for the customer    Host a  slay day  where all teams help CX get to inbox zero  Everyone finishes the day obsessed with solving issues for customers   How to Measure Success for Product Marketing  How do you know  though  if you re actually reaching that customer  Lord brings it back to those four key elements of product marketing  each of which has its own set of metrics   What to build  Here  you ll want to look at product engagement metrics  which are what you might imagine  log ins  usage stats  sales figures   Who to build for  This one often comes down to your customer feedback loop  cancellation surveys  funnel conversion rates  And pay particular attention to your activation metrics   That early life reporting is very important  That will tell you if you re bringing in the right people  and if you re building products for those people    How to price it   Pricing is probably the most challenging for a product marketer to help understand   says Lord   It comes down to surveying and customer research  It s finding out from the customer  When you say this isn t a good value  or it s not the right price  what does that mean to you     How to sell it  This is the most marketing oriented task of the product marketer  and it can be measured with traditional acquisition metrics   click through and conversion rates  customer acquisition costs  funnel conversion rates   and the feedback loops you have with CX or sales    Every dimension of product marketing is measured a different way  but it s absolutely a measurable science    That being said  you won t   and frankly can t   give all of those metrics equal attention at every stage of your growth   There s always a more important part of product marketing at any given time   says Lord   If you re just past product market fit and focused on growth  then you re looking at how to sell your product and who you re building for  Those metrics move to the top  If you re in a more sustainable business phase  and you want to boost LTV or RPU  then you re really looking at how you should price it  What are the other features you re going to build  for stickiness    Here  too  sharing is key  If everyone on the team doesn t know the top level goals you re pursuing  and which metrics have risen to the top  you will always fall short of your peak performance   People laugh about putting dashboards up on walls  But if you don t make those metrics visible all the time  if everyone doesn t know  every day  how you re doing  then they won t be reminded of the urgency  And that s a huge part of the culture of data    How to Keep Product Marketing Delivering Through Thick and Thin  The collaborative  data driven culture of a well integrated product marketing function will pay dividends every day  And when it comes time to weather a seismic product shift  it ll prove invaluable  Lord has led her fair share of product marketing teams through trials and tribulations   these tenets helped them stay the course   Hew to your mission   First and foremost  you have to be able to tie major product changes back to the mission in a very true and honest and vulnerable way  You need to explain how this change is helping you deliver on your promise to the customer   says Lord  Take ClassPass  move to eliminate unlimited memberships  at its root  that decision reflected a fundamental misalignment between the product and the company s mission   Our mission is to make the world a more active place  For that product to be financially viable  we had to actually hope people didn t work out    Communicate thoughtfully   and thoroughly  Once you ve spotted misalignment  and identified the product shift that will solve it  the next job of the product marketer is to walk customers through your logic  Then  you need to tell them where you re going next   Show them what you are going to be building  and help them make the cognitive leap to come along  Some won t  but if you do it right  many will   says Lord   In a nutshell  successfully marketing a major product change is an exercise in painstaking communication  It falls to product marketing to arm every team with any message they need  done carefully and clearly    For ClassPass s recent change  Lord and her team spent weeks interviewing and brainstorming with all of their internal stakeholders  They imagined every possible question and objection they d get   from customers  partners  press  and more   then drafted responses suitable for anything from Twitter to a sales call   It took twenty full working days  with thirty people   says Lord   We were over prepared  but that s what you do when you know customers deserve the right answer  You don t get to be vague  you don t get to lie  you don t get to spin it  You ve got to lean into it and do it really well    Otherwise  it s easy move quickly and not think rigorously   and this is typically not done maliciously  You simply imagine how a big announcement is going to play out publicly  and there s an instinct to rationalize your decision  But that s where a culture of open ideas sharing   that  disagree and commit  policy   can bail you out   It s why checks and balances are so important   says Lord   Someone from CX will step up to me and say   Absolutely not  I cannot say that to a customer with a straight face  That is not true   There s a lot of back and forth    Diligence takes time  and a lot of internal resources  so it s crucial to set the right expectations for your team  And remember  this is probably disappointing for them  too   it s rough to spend months  even years  building something only to see it phased out   You have to honestly say   Hey  this won t be an hour where we send an email and it s hard  This is going to be three months of catching up with CX and handling press inquiries  and earning back some of that goodwill     Return to the product  The best way to regain that trust and goodwill is always going to be with your product  If you ve done step one right   if you ve kept your eye on your mission   this is also where you can also restore your team s passion and enthusiasm during a difficult transition    We tried so many different things   for two years   to make unlimited work  What we ve been able to say to the team over the last couple months is   If we can move the right people to the right plan  and then invest in those plans beautifully  we will have delivered on the promise we initially set   Now  everyone s more committed than ever to ship the product features that will help us deliver    Photography courtesy of ClassPass,"[365 494 549 1036 916 328 13 442 23 32 80]"

502,training-dataset/product/737.txt,product,Designing Your Product s Continuous Feedback LoopWhile every product team I ve worked with leverages customer feedback to inform product decisions in some way  most fall short of designing their customer feedback loop to maximize the benefits to the product team of gathering  recording  and synthesizing feedback  They also often treat customer feedback as a point in time activity as opposed to a far more helpful continuous process  I wanted to share some of the best practices and techniques I ve used for developing a product s continuous feedback loop  designed specifically to maximize the benefit of the customer feedback that your organization is already hearing The first step is cataloging the various sources of customer feedback  Relevant customer feedback can come from a gamut of sources and it s important to think about each source  the relative strengths and weaknesses of feedback from that source  and how it fits into your overall feedback system Let s walk through ten of the most common sources of feedback   product team s typically conduct interviews with either existing or prospective customers to learn more about their needs and experiences with their product  These could be customer validation interviews   persona development interviews  usability studies  and so much more  Customer interviews provide one of the best sources of feedback due to the depth of learning you can get from getting into the minds of users  However  they are often one of the most expensive sources of feedback from the time   effort it takes to gather it  While teams often do these at the beginning of a project  it s important to invest in them in future iterations of the product as well   While customer interviews allow you to get depth of understanding of your customers  customer surveys allow you to scale your feedback process to larger audiences and to achieve statistical significance in your findings  These surveys can take multiple forms as well  whether it s market research on potential new product areas  or gathering feedback from your existing customers on their experience  For example  one of my favorite surveys are periodic Net Promoter Score surveys   They serve as a strong compliment to individual customer interviews by moving from anecdote to quantitative findings   Customer support is talking to your customers every single day  providing a wealth of knowledge on pain points  bugs  feature suggestions  and more  It s important to create a forum by which this feedback gets regularly bubbled up to the product team for review and action   Your customer metric dashboards and funnel analyses provide a view into what s resonating with customers and what s not  Knowing what parts of your product are regularly used vs not helps you quickly determine areas to double down on or areas that need work  While they can t tell you how to fix the problem  they do become an important source of where to conduct further research   Many companies create feedback forums for their users to self help  discuss feedback ideas  report bugs  and more  If you have one  it s important to ensure these are not purely community led and their is regular involvement from the customer support   marketing   product team that is not only participating in the discussions  but summarizing the feedback for use by the product team   If your product is sold through a sales team  the sales team is an incredible source of knowledge as they are talking to potential decision makers of your product every day  It s important to find ways to bubble up what they are hearing on a regular basis to the product team  You need to be careful to realize that their feedback will be coming from decision makers and not end users and you ll need to analyze it appropriately   Most product team s try to dog food their product when applicable within their own company and employees using the product often have great suggestions on additions  You need to be careful here though as their feedback will often reflect power user feedback as opposed to those experiencing the product for the first time with far less motivation   Depending on your product s audience  you ll inevitably find feedback on your product across social media  whether it s Facebook  Twitter  LinkedIn  or blogs and reviews published across the web  or reviews on the App Store or Google Play store  It s important to not only use these sources as a feedback mechanism and a pulse on the sentiment of your product and brand  but also as a channel to engage those customers when appropriate  The bias with these sources are that feedback is most often polarizing   it s either coming from your strongest advocates or your most dissatisfied users   B2B SaaS companies have started developing large customer success teams responsible for driving the adoption  engagement  and continued growth in the usage of their products within existing customers  These folks are also the best source of adoption blockers from your largest customers and should have plenty to say on how to drive quicker and more wide spread adoption of your product with customers   It s becoming common for companies to send feedback surveys to customers who have canceled or stopped using their product for some time  It becomes a great source of feedback on exactly how you lost your customer  The response rates on these surveys are typically low given the lack of motivation of churned users so you ll have to wait awhile for appropriate signal  And you ll need to think through this feedback carefully  because you may ultimately decide that some of these churned customers are not your ideal customer as opposed to assuming you need to action their feedback into the roadmap One of the first things I always do when joining a product team is to setup a feedback river   an open channel for anyone who is interested to get direct access to primary feedback on the product from across various channels  This has typically taken the form of an internal company mailing list in Gmail or Outlook  but I ve also seen it as a feedback channel in Slack or HipChat  I typically require all product managers  designers  and engineering leads to be on the list  but encourage anyone across R D  marketing  sales  customer service  and more that s interested to subscribe as well  The list usually has open write access as well for any internal stakeholder to contribute All feedback that is gathered across the various feedback sources is then encouraged to be shared in a reasonable aggregate form on this channel  For example  let s say the product team conducted a set of customer interviews  They are encouraged to provide both links to interview recordings as well as summarized feedback on the channel  As another example  the customer support team usually has a designated person who sends a weekly customer feedback report on the channel with details of top issues that customers have been facing as well as links to reports for further details This setup ends up having several benefits  First  it provides product managers  designers  and engineers the ability to regularly hear feedback directly from it s source as frequently as they would like regardless of the source of origination  As an organization gets bigger  I always find it take far more effort to get out of the building and actually talk to your customers and the feedback river makes that as bone dead simple as possible  This also helps to ascertain patterns across the various feedback channels  Second  it serves as an internal alias that anyone in the company can use to share feedback and ideas on the product  It s usually the responsibility of a designated set of folks on the product team to respond depending on whether it falls into their product area  And third  it s a great way for new team members to quickly and authentically hear the voice of the customer and understand what excites them most about the product and their pain points While it ends up being a high volume channel that can get noisy at times  I find the benefits of the ease of sending feedback to the list as well as the broad transparency end up outweighing any disadvantages  And folks just filter it into a folder and decide the cadence that makes sense for them to scan it  typically daily or weekly for product team members  In addition to developing a high volume feedback river  I also always setup a feedback system of record  This becomes the source of truth for consolidated and aggregated feedback across various feedback sources designed specifically for facilitating roadmap planning The goal here is to create a highly systematized process such that as new feedback comes in across the various input sources  it is quickly and efficiently processed into the system of record  For each unique piece of feedback received  it should have a short description  one or more feature or product categories it falls under  and names or counts of the requestors  You should then be able to easily sort this by category and frequency I ve typically seen this captured in one of three ways  Microsoft Excel   The simplest approach is to create a shared Google spreadsheet with columns for the description  category  and requestors  The benefits of this approach is that it s quick   cheap to add items and most people are familiar with it  Though the drawbacks are that it creates yet another tool the team has to use in addition to their project management tool  Trello   Alternatively I see folks create a ticket for each unique feedback item and then add the additional details as fields or in the ticket description  The advantages here are that your team is already familiar with the tool  it avoids double bookkeeping across multiple tools  and often provides robust reporting capabilities  The drawbacks are the friction in capturing new feedback items as well as the lack of accessibility of the tool with folks outside of the R D team  Wizeline   There is a fairly new category of product roadmap and management tools that specifically enable you to capture this data with more advanced functionality for analyzing such roadmap requests  The advantages are these tools are specifically designed for this task  though they introduce a new tool you need to pay for and educate people on The trick to making this process work is making it as light weight as possible to get all the data from the various feedback sources into it  If it s burdensome to do so and it s not kept up to date  it ends up being a waste of effort  I find that having a designated person entering data for each source of feedback enables them to quickly accomplish the task given their regular familiarity with it  but also distribute the load across various stakeholders responsible for each source  While I personally prefer the spreadsheet approach  I ve leveraged the others as well because it s important to adopt whatever process you can get your whole team behind It s critical to ensure you incorporate your feedback process directly into your product roadmap process to make the effort you put into cataloging feedback worthwhile  While this sounds simple  I ve seen countless teams that have roadmap planning meetings without much of any discussion about the feedback they ve recently heard from customers and whether that validates or pivots their current roadmap plans When having discussions about what features to prioritize  you can now have a data driven discussion with the team based on actual data inputs from your feedback system of record of who is requesting a feature  whether you re hearing it from multiple channels  and how frequently  This moves away from individual anecdotes overwhelming the dialog or HiPPO decision making to one based on data and truth seeking The key aspect to remember when incorporating feedback into your product roadmap process is that the way to go about doing this is never simply taking the most frequently requested features and putting them at the top of your roadmap  Customer feedback is one input amongst many into your roadmap and needs to be equally considered alongside strategic product priorities driven by your team s objectives Similarly the value of the feedback is not simply the features customers have requested  but the synthesis of the learnings from that feedback  For example  you might notice that a subset of customers are asking for very specific power user functionality and you might ultimately decide that rather than addressing the feedback  the user segment is no longer a target customer  Or you might hear a lot of feature suggestions   confusion   issues with a specific feature and instead of simply addressing the specific feedback  you realize you need to re think the entire experience from scratch to avoid the current user sentiment  Or you might decide the lack of feedback and usage of a feature doesn t mean that people are enjoying it  but that it s getting limited usage and it may be time to kill it  This synthesis of learnings from feedback is absolutely critical  When getting started  I encourage teams to get together on a regular basis to have these types of discussions on how to best to act on the feedback your hearing  Over time as you get accustomed to leveraging your feedback river and system of record  you ll find this becomes a fairly natural part of your product roadmap discussions I hope this provides a detailed look at the continuous feedback loop I ve leveraged in developing products and gives you food for thought on how to incorporate into your own team s process for getting the maximum value out of the critical feedback your team is hearing from your customers,"[502 608 431 126 328 888 1014 13 183 378 549]"
508,training-dataset/product/696.txt,product,3 Product Lessons I Learned From Financebecause of  in spite of it  When I went to college I knew that my ultimate aspiration was to found my own tech startup and in order to prepare myself for that goal  I decided to pursue a dual degree at the University of Pennsylvania from both the engineering and business schools  I studied computer science in the engineering school and ultimately settled on finance at Wharton  While I may have been better served studying marketing or management  I did learn some important finance principles that I still use day to day in my product management role  I wanted to share three such principles that I find incredibly relevant to product One concept that we often talked about with respect to trading was finding arbitrage opportunities   An arbitrage is basically buying low in one market and simultaneously selling higher in another  profiting from a temporary difference  For example  buying an antique in Florida and re selling it for a higher price in California would be a simple arbitrage opportunity I find myself always evaluating every growth channel on it s attractiveness as an arbitrage opportunity  We often talk about how in growth you can t simply re use a list of tactics for your own product because the channels are constantly becoming saturated  over run  and thus less effective  And thus you need to be constantly scouring for new growth opportunities and determining whether an arbitrage opportunity continues to exist  For a SaaS business this may be specifically determining whether you can acquire a customer at a cost of acquisition  CAC  that is well below the customer s ultimate lifetime value  LTV   thus re creating the  buy low  and  sell high  opportunity  But more broadly  I think it s important to leverage this mindset for all businesses  When evaluating a channel  how saturated is it  Are there many folks already exploiting the channel  Does the arbitrage opportunity remain  For example  Atlassian was successful early on in going directly after developers in driving their initial acquisition via free cheap open source editions that could be installed on dev boxes  This was in stark contrast at the time to their competitors that were largely focused on getting tools into organizations via the IT organization  This helped them grow very fast initially  Many others copied this approach of marketing primarily to individual developers  like New Relic and Twilio  resulting in several companies going IPO via specifically exploiting the developer channel  Yet now  everyone is embracing developers as a key audience to go after  even coining it B2D  business to developer   and the arbitrage opportunity is not nearly as attractive as it used to be In investment management  we studied the idea of modern portfolio theory   which states that an investor can construct a diverse portfolio to maximize expected return based on a given level of acceptable market risk  The key was that while diversification could help mitigate risk  it came at the cost of expected return  Risk and return were directly correlated  While I leverage this theory as the basis for managing my personal finances  via Wealthfront    I find it also applicable to product I think about my product s roadmap as a modern portfolio  where I m constantly balancing risk reward across a diverse portfolio of product initiatives  And at each stage of the product lifecycle  I m re assessing the acceptable level of risk to guide the portfolio of initiatives to include in each product cycle  As soon as you launch your product  prioritizing initiatives becomes far more challenging because it s not as simple as doing the one most important thing because you re constantly balancing bugs  performance scale issues  poor performing functionality  customer feedback  brand new features  and entirely new products  There is no steadfast rule that can be applied to guide which items should be included in the upcoming sprint  That s where I find portfolio theory helpful  thinking through the right allocation of resources across these various initiatives and what s appropriate for where the product is at  Maybe you just launched and your pre product market fit  Then your portfolio may be heavily weighted towards improving the existing experiences to get them to resonate  Or maybe you re further along your journey for product market fit and can now think about allocating a meaningful portion of resources to new features products to expand the market opportunity  While I m not calculating expected returns during this process  thinking through initiative allocation across each category of investment is extremely helpful Probably the most important finance principle I learned wasn t from a class at Wharton  but from Andy Rachleff   the CEO of Wealthfront  One of the things we often talked about at Wharton was the difficulty of assessing an investment based on past performance  We ve all seen the disclosures saying  past performance is not indicative of future performance  right before we evaluate an investment based on it s historical returns  We often talk about the hot hand fallacy  which is the false belief that someone who has achieved success with a seemingly random event has a greater chance of future success  Yet this remains what we are effectively doing when judging future performance based on past performance  And while we ve countlessly shown what s wrong with this approach  we continue to leverage it as the main mechanism for evaluating fund performance But is there a better way  Andy Rachleff  based on his years as Vice Chairman of Penn s university endowment  is convinced there is a better way  The approach is to evaluate fund performance on whether it outperformed based on executing faithfully on an a priori stated strategy and whether the outperformance was specifically driven by that stated strategy  If this is true  then those funds that do outperform in this way do most often see repeated success  As in then past performance does become indicative of future performance  The challenge from an investment perspective is its almost impossible to get this level of data and insight that you would need to evaluate based on this approach  unless  say  you are a prominent university endowment  So what s the application to product  Well  we are constantly looking for best practices to replicate when building our own products based on the success of other products  but we often conflate their success with the supposed best practice that they leveraged to achieve it  Sometimes a product s success is nota specific tactic that they employed  but may in fact be  So when trying to find repeatable best practices  I constantly look for lessons where I can determine that the team a priori had stated a specific strategy that they faithfully executed on and there success can in fact be attributed to that very strategy  Only then do you have  outperformance against stated strategy  that can be used as a repeatable lesson for your own endeavors  As an example  I remember when the hamburger menu became a popular design choice for mobile apps  Apps started to incorporate it into their apps as a clean way to extend their navigation beyond the few items typically shown in tab bar navigation  The approach became especially popular when Facebook embraced it in their application  I saw so many more apps starting to adopt it after this point  And I imagine many product teams justified the approach based on Facebook s usage of it  Yet recently we ve seen so many applications move away from this approach  including Facebook  as A B test after A B test has shown that the hamburger menu reduces discoverability and engagement when used as a primary form of navigation  This was a case where folks were leveraging the best practice of using hamburger menus for primary navigation as exemplified by companies like Facebook without in fact ensuring that this tactic itself was resulting in success for Facebook or not  Facebook wasn t successful because of the hamburger menu  They were successful in spite of it I hope this gives you a few frameworks from the world of finance that might be as helpful to you as they are for me in product management,"[508 1253 1134 1183

also produce the most useful insights on how well your customers like your product   14  Conduct usability tests to get an in depth view of how typical users interact with your product and or site as this will inform you where exactly your users get lost  which features are most useful  etc  While there numerous paid usability services  the do it yourself version is to bring in a test user  with a

functionality and less about the appearance of your site  It s important to launch your site and product  even if they are still in an unrefined state  as you need to start generating interest in your offering and keep potential users updated about the status of your company   20  Collect feedback  analyze data  and refine your offering  This is an ongoing process  so the sooner you start improving your offering the better   21  And finally  as you launch your company  keep these words in mind   It s fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure     Bill Gates

528,training-dataset/business/484.txt,business,Day Zero  A new way to define customer successWe re strong proponents of the idea that successful onboarding is about finding the common ground where both you and your customer get value  Every new customer has the potential to be successful with your product  But no matter how well designed your product and how smooth your onboarding  new customers still have to do some groundwork before they can start to unlock full value from it  We call it  Day Zero    when our customers complete that initial work and are able to start getting the full benefit of Intercom  Your product has a Day Zero too  Maybe it s reached when customers have invited five teammates to collaborate  Or integrated your product with one of their core systems  There could be multiple tasks your customer must complete to be fully set up for success  but the concept applies across the board  Day Zero is the moment when a customer has completed the necessary tasks so they can start to realize the full value of your product for the job they are hiring it to do  Achieving Day Zero doesn t mean customers are realizing value  it means they re able to begin realizing the full value  A customer could achieve Day Zero without going on to successfully use your product  but if they don t reach Day Zero real success will be difficult  if not impossible   Takeaway  Day Zero is the minimum set of tasks a user must complete before they realize the full value of your product  Customers that don t reach Day Zero are more likely to churn because it is harder for them to see success  Defining your Day Zero Let s start with what Day Zero is not  It s not signup  It isn t the first day of a trial  It s not when the sales team closes a deal  To find your Day Zero start by defining your ideal end state  a successful customer  What does a successful customer look like  What are they doing in your product  These proximate  or immediate  causes of success define a customer who is using the product well for the job to be done  Next  work backward from that ideal customer  asking  How were they able to do that    And then keep following the steps back by asking how were they able to achieve the prior step  You want to identify the ultimate causes of success  That moment is your Day Zero   Takeaway  While not everyone hires a product to do exactly the same job  most do  Defining your product s Day Zero is a great starting point to help you get the maximum number of customers set up for success  Defining Intercom s Day Zero Our own Day Zero came out of a larger re examination of how our Customer Success team was onboarding new customers  Customers that don t reach Day Zero are more likely to churn because it s harder for them to see success  We began by drawing on our collective experience to consider what our most successful customers look like  That got us to the obvious feature metrics  like live auto messages for Engage customers and regular support conversations for our Resolve product  We already knew that successful users had to install our code and track live users  but our step by step progression through the layers of success helped us surface something we had previously ignored   custom data tracking  Custom data lets Intercom customers understand their users  behavior and send messages in a more personal  targeted way  For example  if our customer has a music sharing app  they can track the number of songs their users have played  and send targeted messages based on user behaviour  Tracking live custom data is key for our customers to realize our core value proposition  To get more customers to be successful  getting them to track custom data was critical  But many customers had trouble identifying what custom data to track  Others didn t recognize the value of adding custom data at all  Tracking custom data also requires coding work  For many non technical users it is a real hurdle to achieving the full value of Intercom  So  the definition of Day Zero we began to settle in on for Intercom was  Javascript code installed and activated  tracking live users  custom data attributes set up The next step was to validate it with data  Takeaway  Avoid the  frecency  pitfall of defining Day Zero based on your top of mind list  It will prevent you from overlooking a crucial  but less obvious  key to success  Validating Day Zero with data Measure the right data and you ll have a true north to help guide your entire process  What gets measured gets done  Using Intercom  we looked at the retention rates for customers reaching Day Zero and compared them to customers that didn t  We found a strong correlation between retention and custom data tracking  Moreover  the Analytics team found that  after installing our code  the single most impactful thing a customer can do to increase their retention rate after four months is to track custom data attributes  It increased retention rates by nearly twice as much than the next most impactful feature use metric  There was also a big drop off in retention for users not achieving Day Zero  confirming our instinct that failing to reach this benchmark limits customer value  For example  look at the retention for one our products  Resolve  below  It helps illustrate what to look for when identifying Day Zero in your onboarding process  If a step significantly impacts retention you can assume it s required for success with your product  If the retention improvements are more marginal  you re seeing additional degrees of success from customers who are already realizing value from the product  This is illustrated by the large increases in retention on the left of the chart  The more Day Zero tasks that were completed  activating the tracking code and adding custom data  the less customers churned   This next graph illustrates what Day Zero looks like from the customer s point of view  After Day Zero  the additional effort they must expend to use the product levels out while the value delivered continues to grow   Takeaway  Use retention data to validate your Day Zero definition  Large gains in retention strongly indicate an onboarding step is required for customers to see the value they expect from your product  Putting Day Zero to work Once you have identified and validated your Day Zero  you want to get as many customers as you can to complete your Day Zero onboarding steps  But start by testing your hypothesis first  We began by choosing just 12 new customers and focused on getting them to Day Zero  In parallel with those experiments we also began to informally educate our Account Executives about Day Zero  encouraging them to introduce the importance of custom data early on in their conversations with potential customers  To help them do that we built a very basic custom data planning tool to share with customers  It was invaluable in helping non technical customers identify the custom attributes they needed and helping them share these with their engineering team  Finally  we deliberately made Day Zero the handoff between the Sales Engineer  who owns technical configuration support  and the Customer Success Manager  who owns customer education and implementation support   With the parameters of our experiment set  we spent an entire quarter focusing on it  What we found confirmed customers who got to Day Zero saw more success  and they saw it sooner  For customers who had reached Day Zero  onboarding didn t involve theoretical discussions about potential value they could achieve if they added custom data  Instead the Success Manager could train them in the practical implementation of their use case  This was the result we had hoped for  It allowed us to move forward with formalizing our new processes and launching systems to manage and track the way we onboarded customers  Takeaway  Start small as you test your ability to get customers to Day Zero  Set benchmarks  then track your efforts and progress against them  Be on the lookout for positive side effects  Broadening the impact of Day Zero To ensure Day Zero has the most impact  expand the scope of its implementation where you have the most control  Sales  Customer Success and Support have different resources than Product or Growth teams  If it s easiest to make product changes  do that  If more customer education and proactive outreach can accomplish your goals for Day Zero  do that  At the same time  educate other teams about Day Zero and encourage them to think about how it might

544,training-dataset/business/529.txt,business,How to Know When You See One   High Alpha   MediumTechnical Risk  While product creation and planning is important  a business needs to understand the larger mechanics of how it works and the viability of its concept   On a large scale  technical risk may be defined as  can the technology be created   This may sound a bit ridiculous to ask  but wireless headphones were not possible at a commercial scale until Bluetooth was created and advanced significantly  Similarly  a company that is focused on creating something that requires significant advancement of technology may need to find different ways to show value to initial investors and customers   A modern day version of this is Hyperloop  The Hyperloop technology is fairly nascent in its current cargo and human transportation use case  so there is a fair amount of technical risk  and investment  that needs to go into the technology  High technical risk is often a sign of a longer company formation to MVP road   While technical risk is not necessarily a bad thing  high risk   high reward   many companies go into development purgatory  a place where a company may be unable to produce a functioning product  if the technology does not become viable or commercially deployable   This consideration should be balanced with the overall large vision for your product  Your  big vision  is your version of your  billion dollar idea   When deciding the value of your product  it s important to realize that the big vision is inherently counterweighted by having a fast GTM  go to market    Big Vision  While technical risk is important to minimize  vision for a company must exist even if pivots may alter the course  For businesses with too little risk  the vision is probably too small  but with too much risk  you may run into the problem of not having a long enough product roadmap  Product visions are vital to creating sustainable and meaningful progress in product building  Often  the big vision of a company is the initial  endpoint  for an overarching product roadmap   At High Alpha  we create large  expansive ideas for what a product could look like  An example of a big vision for Uber might be a fleet of self driving cars that can basically optimize travel so much that prices fall to be competitive with airlines and that it replaces the idea of car ownership completely   The value of the big vision isn t inherently tied to anything tangible for the company itself  but it provides a goal for the company to aspire to  For example  a simplified product roadmap for Uber might be  car ride finder app   self driving cars   fleet manager   route and transportation optimizer  And this allows for the company to properly plan strategic initiatives for product development  partnerships  what platforms and technology are used  and much more   Speed to MVP  The speed to the MVP  minimum viable product  is critical for companies nowadays  Funding opportunities are few and far between and are becoming more competitive  Speed also shows the potential of a business  A company that grows to  1 M in value within 2 years is more valuable than one that takes 5 years  More often than not  your initial vision or plan for your business isn t going to work and requires you to pivot due to the lack of a product market fit or a host of other reasons  The speed to the MVP basically forces a company to build a working and functional  but largely basic  version of their application to syndicate feedback  bring in cash flows  and ultimately start to build a market presence   The definition of an MVP has changed significantly over the past 10 15 years  The bar for an acceptable application  even at MVP  has gone up significantly in terms of product  features  design  etc  Although this may have protracted the larger timeframe from company formation to MVP  it is still critical to find early validation of a concept to build the blocks of a successful business  I find LinkedIn Founder Reid Hoffman s view to be spot on    If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product  you ve launched too late    Frequency of Use  This is a fairly intuitive point about products  but its an important one nonetheless  Products  beyond the UX design   need to be something that people actually need or want to use and moreover products need to have users interact with them daily or as much as possible  This is much easier said than done   The optimal state for every product is that it provides so much overwhelming value for the customer that everyone in the customer s organization needs to use it and uses it for nearly every second of every day  Outside of a few basic applications  this rarely happens  think of Gmail  Excel  databases  Salesforce  note taking applications  calendars  etc     Usually for most companies there s an inherent trade off between depth and breadth  We see this with some of our companies  For Sigstr nearly all members of organizations that are customers use it  however most users are fairly shallow with the amount of involvement they have  The person who gets the most value out of the application is the marketing team who controls and monitors the campaigns and signatures  On the other hand  with Zylo  only a few people in any customer s organization actually use the application  but for those people  it s a heavily used  vital product  At the end of the day  a simple equation can be used to determine the value of the frequency of use   Number of Users   How Often They Use Your Product   Value  The objective here is to somehow balance the two factors enough to maximize the total value to the customer   Services Scalability  Another big consideration we have for products is the reliance on services and therefore the larger scalability implications on the business as a whole  Services are often a great way to create additional revenue for a business  but overly services heavy businesses become difficult to scale and cap out at a certain point   At the same time  services also typically lead to higher average deal sizes and contract values  so they may be beneficial for certain businesses  It may also directly relate to how expansive your product is  if your product requires many integrations and data sources  more services may be necessary   Balancing services and the automation of services in the form of software is often a difficult process for companies  but is vital for scalability   Scalability allows the same tech stack to be deployed to multiple customers  which inherently increases your overall gross margin   Many applications require some level of customization for customers  An example of this would be ClearScholar  Schools all run on different infrastructure and have different ways of interacting with students  thus for each different use case for ClearScholar  it may require significant customization  possibly in the form of services   On the other hand  outside of designs for campaigns  Sigstr is pretty easy to deploy for new customers   Scalability also should be considered in terms of the tech stack itself  While Excel might be a solution for early data management  with larger data sets  it becomes highly manual and arduous without any knowledge of VBA  R  or some other automated process to make it scale more effectively as more data comes and more customers use the product,"[544 1142 101 1253 328 23 627 1222 970 635 427]"
549,training-dataset/product/1317.txt,product,How aligning product and marketing teams improves customer experience447 Flares 447 Flares    It wasn t too long ago that designers and developers were disciples of strictly separate crafts   but today  someone who can do both well is quickly labelled a  unicorn   and sought after by many a unicorn thirsty start up   I believe the same synthesis of skill sets is occurring between marketers and product managers  but all too often  they re treated organisationally as separate disciplines  broken up into siloed teams  It s a common sense approach  but customer attitudes are shifting significantly  which means there s a growing need for both teams to get each other s backs in order to effectively deliver a seamless customer experience  To quote Adaptive Path co founder Peter Merholz from this blog   The experience is the product    I ve worked on the teams of several SaaS products in a dual marketing product management capacity  and have seen first hand the overlapping work that exists between crafting a compelling brand  and building a product that people love  In doing so  I ve witnessed the benefits gained when a cosy relationship develops between marketing and product teams  especially in fast moving start up environments   Easier said than done though  right  I d like to share some practical ways that I ve found invaluable to get marketing and product people pulling in the same direction  and in doing so  nailing objectives for the business   But first we must ask ourselves  why   Why Marketing and Product must work together  We re all familiar with some variation of the traditional linear marketing funnel  The pyramid that starts with Awareness Acquisition  and ends with Loyalty Retention   It s becoming a less and less reliable model for how customers actually engage with brands and businesses  As traditional marketing messaging is increasingly met with distrust  consumers are now empowered by their smartphones and mobile connectivity to find and engage with businesses at almost any stage of the marketing funnel  As long ago as 2014  the Harvard Business Review was talking about how marketing can no longer rely on the funnel   Now  if all your marketing resources are concentrated at the Acquisition stage  it s either not reaching or is irrelevant to those people who ve already moved on to later stages in the funnel   But  there is an alternative model  devised by consulting firm McKinsey  that gives us a bit more insight into today s consumer behaviour  the Loyalty Loop   The Loyalty Loop articulates how today s consumers form relationships with the brands they do business with  It demonstrates that they re highly likely to stay loyal to the brands which deliver them the best end to end customer experiences   from initial consideration  through to post purchase use of the product or service  and back around to subsequent purchases   The Loyalty Loop means that competitive advantage has shifted to those businesses that retain the most customers  instead of the ones that gobble up the most new customers   which in turn means the responsibility for providing a great customer experience falls upon both Marketing and Product teams  equally  Retention has become everyone s top priority   Now  we know that Product has key insights into customers  preferences that could help Marketing propel them around another buying loop  Likewise  Marketing has the inside scoop on what excites and engages users and turns them into customers   so let s look at some practical ways we can get that kind of seamless collaboration going   How to align Marketing and Product  1  Give them common objectives  One easily implemented way to incentivise the dissolution of barriers between Marketing and Product teams is to give them  or advocate for  common objectives and KPIs to go after   to have them succeed and fail as one team   For example  let s say you have your marketers and product team set a common goal to reduce your product service s churn rate to 5  this quarter  Your product team can inform your marketers about the characteristics of those customers who tend not to churn  thus helping them to tailor their messaging to that audience  In the meantime  the product team could be prioritising bug fixes and new features that tackle the churn problem head on   and which gives the marketing team even more fodder for compelling announcements to customers   Last year  during my time leading the team behind a blog analytics platform called Filament  our objectives were often focused on quarterly revenue goals  Our marketing and product teams collaborated closely by pursuing multiple strategies at all stages of the funnel  in order to maximise our chances of reaching them   Increasing traffic and sign ups   Our product team often heard that our customers loved being able to see which influencers had shared their content  so our marketing team prominently displayed that feature on the home page  which drove more sign ups    Our product team often heard that our customers loved being able to see which influencers had shared their content  so our marketing team prominently displayed that feature on the home page  which drove more sign ups Increased upgrade conversion rate   User behaviour insights surfaced by our product team helped marketing identify the highest converting sources of traffic  and then focus on growing those channels   which boosted our overall upgrade conversion rate    User behaviour insights surfaced by our product team helped marketing identify the highest converting sources of traffic  and then focus on growing those channels   which boosted our overall upgrade conversion rate Launch and upsell new features   By sharing ongoing product development updates with the marketing team  we were able to keep our existing customers engaged and upsell them to additional features and apps as soon as they were launched  2  Speak the same language  Agreeing to a common language and standardised internal jargon when it comes to talking about customers is effective for removing the friction from collaboration between your teams  and provides a few key benefits   It gets the teams thinking about the typical customer s whole journey as they pass between marketing and the product  It reduces confusion between the teams  and gets them considering the same customer user personas when making decisions  It makes it easier for product teams to share insights back to marketing on how customers behave after acquisition  I personally experienced this kind of friction on a product where there was a clear disconnect between the marketing and product teams  definitions of an engaged user   Marketing Signed up  Logged in 3  times in the last 30 days Product Signed up  Installed code snippet on their website  Visited 3  screens in the product over the last 30 days  This disconnect caused mass confusion whenever we wanted to know how many engaged users we had  and several times  it resulted in the teams pursuing conflicting priorities  A single meeting was all it took to hammer out a meaningful  commonly understood definition that eliminated the confusion  and allowed the teams to see their impact on the shared objective of growing user engagement   3  Everyone does customer support  The very best feedback comes from sitting face to face with your customer   it gives you the richest  most in depth feedback upon which game changing hypotheses get validated or broken  After all  how can you develop a mutually satisfying relationship with someone  when you never communicate with them directly   In my experience  great things start to happen when everyone shares the responsibility of supporting your customers   Everyone develops an innate sense for what customers need  and how those needs apply to their specific roles in delivering the customer experience  for what customers need  and how those needs apply to their specific roles in delivering the customer experience Response times go way down   which means happier customers    which means happier customers Marketers get a deeper understanding of how their messaging should adapt to customers  needs at every stage of the business funnel  of how their messaging should adapt to customers  needs at every stage of the business funnel There are fewer disconnects between what marketing is promising and what the product service delivers   which can actually reduce pre purchase support inquiries  Roping in people from our product design and marketing teams to handle frontline customer support tickets inspired a major redesign of my past blog analytics product  Filament  as the same question kept coming up from our users while they looked at their analytics reports   So  is that good  or bad    We began gut checking the redesign of our analytics reports to ensure they were clearly answering this simple question   and the improvements we saw started finding their way into our marketing messaging   Know at a glance how your content is performing    Find a way to carve out time for your marketers and product people to rotate through customer support  and I think you will be amazed at the ideas they generate as a result   4  Everyone has a say in the whole customer journey  What do I mean by this  If your customers  experience through your business  Loyalty Loop is to be seamless  it helps if everyone involved in constructing and managing that experience understands the full context of their work   Have representatives of your marketing and product teams  and others  collaborate on an experience map to fully understand   from multiple perspectives   the pain points where your customers  needs or expectations aren t being met  Good ideas can come from anywhere in your business  so give your teams the opportunity to tackle dips in the customer experience from their own perspectives   While building and scaling various SaaS products  the products team at Digital Telepathy   of which I was a part   leveraged elements of experience mapping  as well as the intensive Design Sprints methodology pioneered by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky at Google Ventures  in order to walk through our users  experiences step by step  We used insights from this discovery process to identify our users  wants and needs at each stage  then rapid prototyped and tested solutions to create a more seamless transition between marketing and actually using the product   In summary  seek alignment between Marketing and Product  A great end to end customer experience is becoming an expectation of today s customers  and the only way to provide this is through tight alignment between Marketing and Product teams   Having both teams pulling in the same direction confers massive benefits to your product  including   Stronger retention  and the associated competitive advantage   A more seamless customer experience  Greater focus on more impactful work  instead of chasing vanity metrics that don t actually help the business  Less redundant work   Marketing knows things that can make Product s life much easier  and vice versa  To get that elusive alignment between your teams  treat them like they re a single team  Remember   The experience is the product    so set shared goals  remove any barriers to collaboration between marketing and product  and get both teams some direct facetime with your customers   I think you ll be surprised at what happens next,"[549 365 494

558,training-dataset/product/515.txt,product,Using Experimentation to Drive Product177 Flares 177 Flares    Stephen Pavlovich  CEO of Conversion com  talks to ProductTank London about Using Experimentation to Drive Product  Why aren t people converting and what experiments can you run to try and fix that   The aim of any experiment should be to better understand your users and apply those insights to your product  This does not have to be limited to your landing pages  sign up forms and eCommerce journeys   you can take the same principles and use them to improve your entire user experience  This can affect everything from product pricing  optimising lifetime value and even product functionality   Experimentation can give you data you can t get anywhere else  SaaS products often differentiate their packages by features  A free version will get you 2   5 capabilities and the Enterprise plan will give you the full suite plus added support  The issue here is that people don t know what functionality they need until they have already signed up   Conversion com ran a test version of a product where they created the levels by usage rather than functionality  So everyone got the same product  but the more you paid the more you could use it  This approach resulted in a 100  increase in revenue vs the more established method   Insight into such behaviour is difficult through qualitative methods because people don t know how they d react in the situation you re describing  Experimentation allows you to actually see people in the context you re looking to optimise  The participants don t even realise they re in a test and so biases that invalidate the outcomes can t be established   You can find out things quicker through experimentation than anywhere else  In order to run a valid test you don t need to implement a full version of the product or feature you re looking for insight into  You can present a simplified version or perhaps even a link to something that looks like the feature and see how many people will click on it to test appetite  You can then make your roadmap or prioritisation decisions based on some data rather than just instinct  These could be looked at as  minimum viable tests  which won t show you all the aspects of the decisions you re looking at  but will give you enough information to move forward   Success is a measure of the choices we make  Experimentation let s us peek at the result   in digital or physical   If you are a company which makes physical products  then your supply chain will likely be highly complex  Making choices which have an impact on that chain will be high risk with the potential for an expensive impact if you get them wrong  In this situation using digital experiments  can give you an insight into whether it s worth making the more expensive physical change   For example  you might test whether it s worth manufacturing a whole new product by offering it in the digital store first and seeing appetite   with a sold out banner later on in the process  This is obviously a poor user experience for the small number that it effects in the short term  but will result in a better product over the long term  For the short term cost in user experience  you are able to better direct your resources to what the majority of your users really care about   Again the people in these tests are not having to vocalise or rationalise their behaviour as they would do in a focus group or interview   they are simply voting with their clicks  This results highly actionable data   Use a hypothesis framework to give you an  unfair advantage  against your competitors  The same framework that can apply for physical tests  can be used to manage your digital experiments or even your SEO programme variations,"[558 859 1253 442 378 850 431 365 494 916 1164]"

businesses grow and team members become more specialized  it s easy to get further and further from the customer   Buffer is no exception   in the course of our journey  there have been multiple times when we ve felt a much larger distance than we d like between us and our customers   What s interesting is that every time that distance starts to make itself felt  something amazing happens to close the gap  Sometimes it s a deliberate change on our part and at other times it s been almost like fate   No matter how it comes about  it s always a welcome realization to reunite with our incredible customers  And now that we recognize the pattern  we re putting new systems in place to make sure we re never too far from those who use our product   We d love to share a few stories that illustrate the value of keeping customers at the heart of your business  and some strategies and tactics we re experimenting with to keep close to those who make Buffer possible   The surprise senator encounter  When our Chief Technology Officer Sunil joined Buffer in 2012  he was an Android engineer  working closely with customers and answering plenty of support tickets   In the past few years  though  his role has evolved to focus more on growing the engineering team and he s moved further away from that customer pulse   Then  Sunil happened to meet a U S  senator he had long been a fan of at a book signing  When the senator heard that Sunil worked for a social media startup  he encouraged him to talk with his staff about social media management   and in those following conversations  Sunil learned that the senator s team loved Buffer   The more he chatted with the team  the more fired up Sunil got about certain features that would help the senator with his social media workflows   The chance encounter gave Sunil a deep realization of how he d lost sight a bit of the heart of Buffer   our customers   He wanted to bring it back  and share that  fired up  feeling with the whole Buffer team   Customer centered  What does that really mean   Keeping customer centered as a company means having a constant focus on our customers at an individual level  It s easy to say  but harder to apply on a day to day basis   The most direct way of keeping customer focused is taking the time to talk to individual customers  Everyone in the company should have many opportunities to speak to the customers they serve    When you talk to customers it changes a lot of things   Sunil says   You stop thinking in terms of deadlines and build up an intrinsic motivation to see them happier  This improves team execution because customer happiness will always be the most important shared incentive across different roles and teams    Our founder  Joel  set the tone early in Buffer s journey by defaulting to the lean methodology where energy and time is saved in the pursuit of whatever is best for the customer  This applies to customer service  to marketing and beyond   Image from The Lean Startup  A  toeless  organization  When Buffer was a smaller team  there were more roles that overlapped with customer interactions and it was easier to keep a pulse on customer feelings throughout the whole company   As we ve grown to a team of nearly 80  the roles are a bit more specific and we have dedicated customer support and research teams  some of our biggest teams  who are awesome at communication with customers   While this is valuable in providing better customer follow through and response times  it can create an adverse effect in  shielding  our product and engineering teams from the true end goal of customer happiness   During a time of massive team growth in 2015  we noticed a chasm between the Happiness and Engineering teams   At the time  Sunil shared these thoughts    While we all have individual roles and titles and separate defined teams  it s absolutely important not to see ourselves fully contained within that context alone  I noticed for myself questioning   I m not even sure if I should jump in the inboxes since there are more heroes now and I m uncertain what the flow is today and whether I ll slow them down   I ve had a few conversations around the team on this challenge and hearing a lot more about the phrase   I m afraid to step on toes  I felt afraid to step on the heroes toes  and I m sure the heroes have felt afraid to step on engineering toes it ends up snowballing    Creating more crossover between Happiness and Engineering was a powerful start to creating a  toeless  organization   Thank you to team member Tom for the term    What does this look like   If there s a down time in service  engineers jump into the support inbox and answer emails and Tweets   If engineers deploy a coding change  pop into the appropriate Slack room to let the support team know and also monitor for any hiccups   A closer relationship between teams on a personal level  Sunil shared this great reflection in a Discourse   I think one key reason we had a closer relationship between Engineering in Happiness in the past was because we knew each other deeply  I would feel personally responsible if Caro  Mary  Adam had a tough day in the inboxes due to a change I made  I think it might be useful to connect the two teams to feel responsible for each other  rather than feeling like they re two separate teams with different objectives  This means  engineers should reach out to heroes  perhaps in the same timezones and get to know them better  and vice versa     Next steps  Team  meet customers   As a whole  we still have a lot of work to bring the team closer together and closer to our customers   As I talked with Sunil for this post  I was personally struck at how long it s been since I interacted with Buffer customers and it drove home the deep conviction to dedicate some of my time to chatting with our community and reaffirming why we do what we do   The next phases of our customer focused plan involve   Having team members all be involved in customer support in different capacities  and relevant to their roles or areas of expertise   for example  our Respond team wouldn t find as much benefit in talking to Buffer customers    Automatically sending feedback emails from every Business customer that leaves Buffer to the entire product team  Providing some level of customer service training during our bootcamp period   Encouraging open customer calls and allowing slots for other team members to join in and listen to customers first hand    We must be steadfast in seeking out the right voices   Sunil says  Sometimes  that means doing things that don t scale   Data can only tell you so much  You need to dedicate time focused on that individual customer interaction  That builds up intuition and emotion in the best way    This will continue to take shape as the company grows  our customers change and our team learns from each experience   What customers have taught us  Stories from our team members  If we ever stray too far from our incredible users  stories like those that follow are sure to bring us back   We asked Buffer teammates to share some of their favorite customer encounters and what they have learned  They had some amazing reflections   One customer s experience fixes problem for all  Niel  Engineer    I remember a few years ago working with a customer that had some trouble using the dashboard  It was quite slow at times for him  So I ended up taking a look and noticed that he had many many updates lined up in his queue  He was scrolling quite a lot which caused our app to suffer a bit  I really enjoy it when customers find the boundaries of our app  So I dug in a bit more and found some glaring performance issues related to scrolling  I ended up creating a special fix for him  Soon after we realized this could improve the experience for all our users and have since incorporated the fixes for him into the rest of our app  So grateful for customers like him who speak up  They help us a lot in improving the experience    One minute matters  how a deeper investigation changed the posting process    Colin  Happiness Engineer    A great relatively recent example that struck me was one of our customers who kept seeing his 2 00am update actually post at 2 01am  Not a big deal  but he really wanted it to go out at 2 00am  Initially  I explained that with all the posts we send  some may naturally  leak  into the next minute  but that it should be rare  He came back  still noticing this  and it triggered me to do a more in depth investigation of how good we are at posting  on the hour   In the end  with some amazing work by Dan   Sunil  we re configured our posting process to be a lot more efficient so that many more updates now goes out in that  golden minute  when it should  For me  this was a great example of the benefit of listening to customers as often times they have a better feel for how things work since they use the product regularly and with particular requirement  Initially  I dismissed the customer s concerns as just being  one of those things    it was only with his patience and insistence that I dug in and found that there was indeed a problem    Better accessibility for all in our weekly Twitter chat  Arielle  Community    One memorable moment was when a community member shared feedback that the way we shared Bufferchat questions was inaccessible for him  We shared the questions as text within an image  with the mindset that it looked nice and could show all of the questions in one neat and tidy image  This is when I learned a bit more about how a screen reader works  and that it couldn t read text in an image like this  It was so eye opening and I am so grateful for this community member  and others who have shared similar pieces of feedback  for teaching me how to think about our customers in a very holistic way and put accessibility at the forefront of my mind    Test users catching huge issues right away  Andy  iOS developer    We have a bunch of iOS VoiceOver users who have graciously joined out TestFlight external betas and they consistently provide feedback around areas of the app which we can improve to make it even easier for them to use Buffer  We ve had cases in the past where the items on screen simply didn t have a label or hint associated with it which means users relying on VoiceOver weren t able to tell when some elements were tappable  An example was with our v4 0 app  an awesome user joined our beta for v5 0  I sent over a personal note to thank him and ask him if he would fire over any VoiceOver issues he came across  Within a few hours we learned that our analytics in v4 0 weren t accessible at all but our v5 0 build had already tackled it for the most part  The same user also noticed a regression in our accessibility when VoiceOver was announcing that the profile selection button was available when editing posts when it is only available when creating updates    Customers turned trouble shooting experts  forging long time bonds  Sunil  CTO   In late 2012  I rebuilt the Buffer Android app and released it  I quickly realized he didn t test it thoroughly across different devices that he didn t have access for testing     I learned quickly how generous and forgiving our customers are   collaborating with many individual customers to get things fine tuned  This level of fast feedback would not have happened without engineers working directly with customers  One interaction stuck out in my mind and the customer still tweets me to this day about it   Every bug matters  Why spending hours for one customer is worth it    Darcy  Twitter Happiness Lead   One day  a customer tweeted us about the URLs from her website not showing well when scheduling them through Buffer  As a blogger  she was dependent upon her URLs showing beautifully  and I instantly felt terrible for the situation we put her in   I reached out to an engineer who I thought could help  After a few hours of digging in  he found a solution   Some might feel that digging into a bug for a few hours is a long time to spend solving an issue that only affects one customer  That s not how Mike thought of it  When a customer comes forward to share their troubles with our product  it s a gift  They not only shared their time with us  but they shared their expertise in using our tool and also gave us a the chance to make our product better   Taking the time to share how our words come across so we can improve    Juliet  Happiness Hero   A customer reached out to share their feedback on a pop up message within Buffer   how it made him feel slightly sad and guilty  which is not at all how Buffer always makes him feel with our culture and value  It was so amazing to hear how much emotion we could trigger in our customers with a pop up that we might ve written a long time ago perhaps without too much thought  We ve shared these thoughts with the team to re think this particular popup  It was such an incredible reminder on how every detail matters   as each of them shapes the experience and relationship we build with our customers and communities   We re honored to work with the most amazing customers on the planet and learn from all the knowledge and wisdom they have to share   Over to you  Do you have any ideas to help us to connect more with our customers  We d love to hear your thoughts in the comments,"[593 328 549 1014 888 1026 1247 32 881 502 756]"
608,training-dataset/business/927.txt,business,How to analyze customer feedback and make it actionableIn part one of our best practice guide to understanding customer feedback  we looked at how to analyze and understand the types of feedback most important to your business  But once you ve decided which feedback you want to pay attention to  how do you transform customer feedback into something you can act on as a company  How can you take a jumble of open ended feedback and use it to inform your product roadmap  Follow these steps  and you ll have a prioritised list of customer insights you can act upon with confidence  You can even use the output of your analysis to inform your product roadmap  1  Collate your data First  collate all the open ended customer feedback you want to analyze  plus key metadata about each customer  into a spreadsheet  Ideally  the metadata will include attributes such as how long the person has been a customer  how much they spend  date the feedback was submitted  and the source of the feedback e g  open ended survey question  Of course  you can use Intercom to help gather this data  Your column headings should look something like this   2  How to think about categorising the feedback A general rule that you can apply to help you make sense of customer feedback is to group it by  Feedback type Feedback theme Feedback code Let s break these down  1  Feedback type Categorising your feedback into different types is particularly helpful if you re dealing with unclassified feedback from your customer support team or situations where customers could write anything they liked in a survey field  e g   Any other feedback for us    Here are some categories you may find useful  Usability issue  New feature request  Bug  User education issue  Pricing billing  Generic positive  e g   I love your product     Generic negative  e g   I hate your product     Junk  this is useful for nonsense feedback like  jambopasta     Other  this is useful for feedback that s hard to categorise  You can go back and recategorise it later as patterns emerge in the rest of the data  2  Feedback theme Breaking feedback down into themes can be useful when you re trying to make sense of a high volume of diverse feedback  so if your data set is small  roughly speaking  50 pieces of feedback or less  then you may not need this  The themes you come up will be unique to the actual feedback you ve received and will usually relate to aspects of the product  For example  let s say you work on a popular product like Instagram and you ve received a bunch of customer feedback  Your themes might look like a list of specific product features  like this  Photo stream  Stories  Mentions  Profile This type of categorisation is particularly useful when you re working in a situation where you re likely to have to feed your insights back to multiple teams to take action on  i e  if you have one team that works on Stream  another on Stories  etc   Sometimes themes can by team related  e g  customer support  sales  marketing  or they could be related to unmet needs that customers are experiencing  Try coming up with some themes and see if these types of category are useful to you and the data you re making sense of  3  Feedback code The purpose of the feedback code is to distill the raw feedback the customer has given you and rephrase it in a more concise  actionable way  Your goal is to make the feedback code descriptive enough so that someone unfamiliar with the project can understand the point the customer was making  The feedback code should also be as concise and true to the original customer feedback as possible  Your job is to distill the feedback as objectively as possible  whether you agree with it or not  Here s an example,"[608 502 431 126 888 13 183 328 1014 1417 378]"
617,training-dataset/product/389.txt,product,Searching for Product Market Fit67 Flares 67 Flares    Rodrigo Madanes has got 25 years of experience designing and developing successful web and mobile products at companies such as Skype and eBay  Rodrigo will talk about exploring product market Fit  sharing his lessons learned about first focusing on the needs of a specific user segment  Rodrigo dives into what it means to find product market fit  some techniques for finding it  and how long it can take  By way of example  At Skype  in their early adopter phase  they still had 40 50 million registered users  The wave can take 10 15 years  and it s not about size of user base   How Do You Recognise Product Market Fit   If you re sensible  after launching your product you ll spend some time searching for product market Fit before you try and aggressively take what you believe your market to be  But working out when you have product market fit is a tricky thing  Having a growing user base doesn t necessarily mean that you re solving a real problem for a defined market  or that you ve built something that people actually want   it might just mean that you have great marketing   Size of user base isn t actually that helpful  so you need to try and look for other behaviours and  more importantly  more specific segments of your audience  Do you get a lot of return visitors  Do you have good Net Promoter Scores  Are your users giving you money  Do you have stable cohort retention curves  These are the signs that indicate a potential product market fit   Once you ve found that fit  then you should go out and find all the people who make up that audience  and finally take the market  As observed by Marc Andreessen  a startup really has two very different phases of existence   Before Fit and After Fit   and thus two different sets of goals and behaviours  Don t get those two mixed up   What Next   Taking this a step further  you need to find the specific set of features that matters to a specific  defined market  then work out exactly how to reach that market  i e  which channels to use  and invest just in those  However  you ll likely find  as most startups do  that although you ll get a ramp up in users when you hit product market fit  your growth will gradually plateau  It s important to remember that growth is bumpy  and as your first product market fit growth spurt starts to slow  you should already be looking into the next set of features that will trigger another round of fit based growth   Next  it s important to focus on the intensity of NPS  or some other measure of user love for your product   Put simply  if you try and build something for everyone  you ll build something that s great for nobody  Focus on the users who really love your product  and build for them  as they re more likely to be a defined market  and they re more likely to help you grow   And finally  on the topic of defined markets  focus on specific segments of your potential audience  Realistically  your audience is a complex and multi faceted mess of different types of people  so you need to investigate  using things like cohort analysis and segmentation  to work out exactly what defines your market  e g  what mobile platform they re using  location  wealth  life stages    and then work out how to reach them,"[617 1134 1215 151 129 23 80 81 378 1142 348]"
627,training-dataset/product/948.txt,product,Market Fit   what I ve learned about the goal  the process and the nuanceWhat does the macro process look like in theory   While it ll never work out like this in the real world  I see the intended journey to Product Market Fit  and then scale  as a 6 step process   0   Starting Point  You need some nugget  some pain point  some passion or hunch to spring off from  The early stages  starting here  are about understanding and validating significant Desirability  and therefore the focus is on understanding a big problem people have  not on coming up with novel ideas  If you re stuck here  and don t know where to even begin  be patient and open your mind to problems you experience everyday that annoy the hell out of you   Paul Graham has great advice for this stage  He says to  live in the future  then build what s missing   By this  he means try every new product you can get your hands  read everything you can about trends and even read science fiction  Then  think about what hasn t been solved yet that really should  and do that   1   Problem Insight  This is where you actually begin to work  In this stage  you basically perform a lean and mean and fast as hell research project  Talk to as many relevant people as possible  as quickly as possible  in person as much as possible to understand if this problem exists  if it is big enough for people to pay for it  if it is so big and juicy that some would actually pay you right now to solve it  and who feels this problem the most  There s tons written about uncovering the  Job To Be Done   my post  for instance   or the  User Goals   About Face is the quintessential textbook on goal oriented UX design   Work to understand these methodologies and do your homework   Remember  this step is about uncovering a deep problem  Get truly insightful before you move forward   2   Problem Solution Validation  Here is where you begin to think about Feasibility  In this stage  you want to have a hypothesis about what the output of a solution looks like  and test whether it actually solves the problem  This is not about testing the technical aspects of the process you believe will create that output  but whether the output itself solves the problem  Answer this question for yourself  can this problem feasibly be solved to a high enough degree for people to throw money at you for the solution output  The process to get there uses a Minimum Viable Product  MVP     An MVP is not a cheaper product  it s about smart learning  steve blank  Steve Blank  tells a great story about an agriculture data company who were trying to prove that if farmers had better arial data about their fields  health and moisture levels  the solution output   they would be able to solve the problem of wasting resources by watering their entire fields equally  the problem   The product they envisioned used drones  specialized cameras and complicated data analysis software to provide the data output  and therefore thought the best MVP was a hacked version of that product  which would take a few months  and a bunch of cash  to build  Instead of this  Steve had them fly over a few fields in a helicopter with a camera  manually process the data and see if the farmers would buy the output and put its insights to good use  They were able to execute that over a weekend   That s what an MVP should be  a test of  if I provide you with this solution  does it solve this problem that I know you have   It s about the solution output  not the specific process that produced it  The challenge is to think creatively about what s the best MVP for your product that tells you if your hypothesized solution output works  as fast and as cheap as possible   3   Product Iterations  Here is when you re finally in a place to build and launch an actual product  Alpha version  private beta  public beta  etc   Whatever the process you want to take to put your early product versions into market  here s when you do it  In this stage  you continue to refine Desirability  broaden the work on Feasibility to executing an actual product that can create the solution output discussed above  and start to focus on understanding whether there is a Viable business model in here somewhere   The key here is having an incredibly fast learning cycle as you work your way from  definitely not having PMF   to an awesome and sustained  WOOOOOOO          that comes when you reach PMF  more on the learning cycle below   Start with the absolutely must have core user experience  and build   tweak from there  It s about learning what s going to help you nail PMF  so a combination of analysis of your data  user behaviours   and ongoing qualitative based user interviews is what gives you the insights required to get there   4   Product Market Fit  Pretty straight forward here  because we already discussed it  but this is when everything just clicks  and it s off to the races  It is the moment in time where you shift from a sole focus on creating the right product  to continuing to do that while actually building the business  aggressively so    5   Scale  Once you hit PMF  you need to triple down on scaling the product  You need to always be improving on the product offering  while optimizing the funnel  building out sales and marketing teams and scaling the organization to support   A massive warning here is that you can lose PMF at any given time  due to competitive pressures  a screw up in your product roadmap and even broader changes in the marketplace  So stay ahead of things and be rigorous  insightful and methodical about product development  and keep an eye on early warning signs  NPS  engagement    revenue and growth   Again  in practice  the process is never this perfect and straight forward  more on that later   but I find it useful to have a simplified process map in my head  in order to understand where I m going and how to theoretically get there,"[627 1142 1134 81 23 328 1417 544 80 32 365]"
635,training-dataset/product/412.txt,product,The Fundamental Tension in Product   Startup Grind   MediumIn crafting products  there s a tension between two dispositions   On the one hand  methodologies like lean startup and agile push us to regularly fit our product to the real world  By regularly running tests  validating demand  and shipping in small iterations  we can keep an up to date map of our product s environment  Using market signals as a steering mechanism seems to be the surest way to create value   On the other hand  the most impactful products  don t just react to their environment  they change it  Igniting real change  it seems  requires a leader s unwavering commitment to a vision of how the world should be   How can  unwavering commitment to a vision  coexist with  using market signals as a steering mechanism   The options are to  a  bend your vision to fit the discovered realities of the real world or  b  charge straight through obstructions until you break through or blow up   While it s alluring to commit to one disposition over the other  the great companies simultaneously change the world and operate within it  There s no formula for how they do it  But I ve created a diagram that can at least help describe how the most impactful companies reach for their vision while adapting to the world as it is   The full diagram  Now that I ve bombarded you with the full diagram  I ll unpack it through describing three types of loops   Reality Orientation Loops  How companies create feedback loops to win customers and markets  Transcendent Loops  How companies use markets as stepping stones for  world changing  impact  Vision Loops  How companies create new behaviors  markets  and industries   Reality Orientation Loops  Companies have a vision for where they want to go  but the evolving landscape around a product is filled with surprises  both good and bad  A company faced with a setback can overreact like a government in the wake of a terrorist attack  And new pathways to success can go unobserved  The reality orientation loops represent how companies  guided by market signal  stay oriented as they move forward  If you can maintain the healthy functioning of these loops  you can retain mastery of your context and act accordingly   Let s start with the loop that frames the reality orientation loops   Winning a market  Tech  Users    Capital   The loop encircling Tech  Users  and Capital represents how companies try to win markets  The objective is to apply resources to build a technology and attract users with a stellar user experience  Hopefully  people will love or need the product so much that they ll pay for it  or be valuable to advertisers   If all goes well  the company will reinvest revenue or other funds back into enhancing the technology  The loop  given success  repeats   Companies can t conquer markets guided by only gut feeling  To stay oriented  they need three intersecting feedback loops   Reality orientation feedback loops  Users   Tech  No matter how powerful a company s vision  even if you re Apple  you can t blindly sustain a great user experience  Companies require insight into the people who use or might use their product  This type of insight exists in qualitative forms  like user testing and surveys  and quantitative forms  like web analytics and A B testing  When this feedback loop breaks  the organization can t adjust when the product doesn t stick  When the loop is healthy  product usage provides a strong signal for product direction   Users   Capital  The terms of the loop connecting Users and Capital is how we traditionally describe the health of a business  No matter how viral a product is  to grow revenue  companies must invest specifically in acquiring users  whether it s through traditional or untraditional methods  Even Facebook advertises itself  Industry thinking about how to balance user acquisition and revenue is ever evolving  The feedback loop is problematic when the product is not achieving the intended balance between customer acquisition cost and revenue  If you re trying to be profitable  the loop is broken when acquired users are not converting to paying customers  If you re trying to grow  the loop is broken when your pricing strategy introduces too much friction  For an example of a thriving users capital loop  see how Uber used  Capital as a Performance Enhancing Drug    Capital   Tech  Engineers shouldn t build  build  build all day  To ship the right product at minimal cost  teams need to examine their process regularly  Process improvements can be in the form of tweaking project management structure  communication methods  or tools  When the Capital Tech loop breaks  teams fail to deliver within business parameters  i e   they ship a flawed product or run out of time  When the loop is functioning  the team continuously improves its velocity and the soundness of each release   Transcendent Loops  All companies must create reality orientation loops to navigate their local environment  No matter how grand a company s vision  to realize it  they must win real markets  Customer driven companies  as defined by Venkatesh Rao  operate only in these inner loops  These companies play a zero sum game  remixing established technologies and business models to engage customers already made legible by a market  They win by taking customers from others  The winners ultimately fade away when larger forces erode the market  In contrast  product driven companies  again  in the Rao sense  alter their environment  feed off the flux  and create new markets  industries  and behaviors   The  transcendent loops  in the diagram represent how companies can use their local environment as a stepping stone to set in motion a more fundamental impact  transcending current markets  We can use this framework to separate the paths of the most impactful companies   Transcendent loops  Capital   The Economy  A company s business model can do more than capture wealth  it can transform the economy around it  Google s search advertising business model  for example  disrupted findability for businesses  creating a new class of Internet based companies  Google s platform is now foundational for anyone striving to make money online   For this to happen  Google had to start by taking users from competitors like Yahoo in the inner loops of the search engine market   Users   Society  Product driven companies  through their user base  impact society at large  While Facebook started by scratching the social itch of college students  the power of the platform has reached global proportions  even playing a role in political movements like the Arab Spring   For Facebook to reach for its vision of  making the world more open and connected   they ve had to monetize through the inner loops brand advertising market   Tech   What s Possible  While customer driven companies meet customer and business objectives through remixing established technologies  some companies create new building blocks  opening new possibilities for all developers  Amazon  for example  created AWS as a side effect of their eCommerce business  making it easier and cheaper for anyone to launch an internet company   Amazon started by taking on incumbents in the inner loops of the booksellers market   Vision Loops  While some people work at startups to make money  others dream to make a dent in the universe  and  conveniently  make money   The most ambitious companies  if successful  introduce novelty into the world  causing unpredictable change  The company who creates a dent is positioned to be the primary benefactor of the change they create  They are the first on the scene to understand it and build on top of it   Vision loops  Society   What s Possible  Winning a market requires tapping into established patterns of behavior  often solving problems for their users  Deeper product impact  however  unearths latent behaviors  To grasp the phenomenon of Twitter  one might ask  What problem does Twitter solve   You can force an answer  but to pose the question misapplies customer driven dynamics on a product driven phenomenon  Rao suggests that product driven companies tap into an  anomie   He writes     there exist untapped regimes in their universe of behavior that are marked by undefined restless energy and undirected curiosity  This creates a certain level of anxiety  and a regime of under developed behaviors  often bucketed under  play  or  hobby  behaviors  characterized by amateurishness  which is another way of saying pre economic    When a product unleashes new behavioral forms  a slew of new companies follow to build technologies around the behavior  e g   all the companies striving to re channel the desire to tweet   Product directions can fail by prematurely banking on their ability to create new behaviors  Blippy and Swipely failed to entice users to broadcast their purchases socially  Now  Venmo has successfully created this new behavior  Why Venmo succeeded and the others failed could be a combination of execution and timing   the precise factors are impossible to know   Society   The Economy  It is has been argued by Peter Thiel and others that the most significant innovations don t play in existing markets  they create new ones  Apple  for example  wasn t the first company to produce a tablet  However  they created the tablet market with the iPad and captured the majority of the market s value  When a market is legible  customer driven competitors can attack the space from a variety of angles to win share  While erosion will happen with time  market creators are so valuable due to their high probability of extended business success   Marc Andreessen says that if you re looking for the next great startup idea  you can dig through the graveyard of failed companies from the late 90s  The grocery delivery market  for example  is growing now  fueled by Instacart and other players  Companies like Webvan and Kozmo failed to reach the same vision previously  perhaps due to lack of the smartphone and the entrenched online shopping behaviors we have now  One might argue that the iPhone and Amazon com products created the grocery delivery market  not because they are competing in the space  although Amazon is   but because they created the necessary conditions for the market to form  Visionary companies  to massively succeed  don t need to capture all  or even the majority  of the new value they create   The Economy   What s Possible  When new behaviors and markets enter the picture  new industries form to support the changing world order  You can walk down the value chain to anticipate the rippling effects of market changes  To bolster the iPhone  Apple expedited the formation of the mobile app industry by creating the App Store marketplace  Slack is applying a similar strategy with their developer fund and app directory   While some companies intentionally create supporting industries as a strategy  the most impactful products can engender supporting industries as an unwanted side effect  For example  the rise of search engines created the SEO industry  While SEO can be a good lens through which to improve the relevancy of web pages  Google continuously has to battle SEO specialists who try to game their algorithms   Conclusion  That s it for walking through the diagram  I hope you found it useful  It begs the question  what do we do with it  Unfortunately  I m not sure yet  and I feel like I still have a long way to go wrestling with the subject matter of this post  If you think of any applications of the diagram or ways to improve it  let me know  Otherwise  stay tuned   Update  I ve continued this train of thought on my blog  Product Logic,"[635 1184 1134 544 1215 716 328 23 1188 617 427]"
642,training-dataset/product/105.txt,product,How to turn a story point factory into a customer centric team 148 Flares 148 Flares    The one spontaneous ovation at this year s London MTPCon was when Drift CEO David Cancel muttered  I hate agile  as an aside while he was on stage  Agile  a revolutionary idea 10 years ago  has clearly lost its shine for many people   However  almost all the product teams I know use some agile methods  and they are certainly great tools to break down mega projects into manageable parts  to bring back flexibility to the development process or make it easier to estimate resources  But many people feel they have become story point implementing machines  and the focus on agile has meant that the original goals of focusing on clients and end users have become lost along the way  For them agile looks like a needless abstraction layer between the development team and their customers  How can we bring customers back into the picture   More customer insights with continuous research  Firstly  if you want to get closer to your customers you need continuous research  There are two main areas that I believe need to be covered  The first area is feedback from your target audience about your existing product  This means user tests with your product or prototype  Our UX minimum checklist for example suggests at least one user test each week to give you the feedback necessary to build a great product   The other area is product discovery  Your target group s unsolved pains and needs will enable you to identify new opportunities  The most common methods uncovering these are interviewing and field research  but diary studies and experience sampling are also good ideas  If you have an existing product I would suggest you try out jobs to be done interviews  which will help you to uncover the real reason that people use your product  In my experience you often get a surprising result which will lead to a rethink of your product s real goal  and how you develop it further  Product discovery methods often result in new feature or product ideas  For example when we were conducting interviews for a stock trading product  the two major problems that almost everyone mentioned were market analysis and the mental challenges they had  There are many different aspects to analysing market data  and there are many tools to help you too  But the second problem  mental challenges like control of your emotions  is a new and untapped area   The trick is to do product discovery continuously too  Marty Cagan suggests a dual track scrum approach  In this method a small part of the team works on product discovery  while the rest work on designing and building the validated feature ideas  If you don t have that many people you can spend some time with discovery every month and have a strategy meeting in every two or three months to sum up the findings and decide on the direction   Bring your team closer to your customers  Research is time consuming  so most teams have separate researcher positions or they work with experienced external researchers  But how can you share all your findings with the design and development team   The goal is to give the first hand experience of your customers to everyone in your team  One way of achieving this is to get everyone to do a small amount of support work  a few tickets per month for example  In many companies developers attend a usability test from time to time  In the enterprise world visiting some sales demos can be an eye opener too   A great UX design team can help you to facilitate different kinds of workshops  Design workshops can help to align the team and get everyone on board  You can build up your personas or customer journeys together based on the research results   Ideation sessions can also help  When you discover new user pains the team should come together and brainstorm on features and products to solve them  It s also useful to hold common sketching workshops when you try to solve bigger usability flaws  You can use the design studio method  which can help you to balance individual and group thinking  giving everyone the time to think about ideas on their own  These workshops usually take just a few hours  but by the end all participants will have better understanding of user pains and possible solutions  They work the best when you invite people with different backgrounds  developers  designers and business people should attend   Another trick I always use is to put up posters on the office walls  If you want your team to think about different user pains  you can put them up on the wall  so everyone will see them all the time  and in time someone will come up with a good idea   Showcase customers in your agile metrics  There is no real connection between metrics like velocity and customer satisfaction  You can develop features with a huge number of story points  but it doesn t mean you solve real customer pains  Some teams drop metrics like velocity  and different estimation numbers and just start to kanbanize their efforts  If you are not ready to do that you can still highlight customer pains in your metrics  and take these into consideration when you prioritise tasks   One idea is to group the development tasks from your backlog into the following four big categories   Metrics movers   With these features we can achieve short term business goals and reassure investors     With these features we can achieve short term business goals and reassure investors  Under the hoods   Refactoring and rebuilding  These help us prevent technical debt and maintain a good code quality     Refactoring and rebuilding  These help us prevent technical debt and maintain a good code quality  User needs   Usability issues and user requests  These improvements will give a sense of quality to our customers     Usability issues and user requests  These improvements will give a sense of quality to our customers  Strategic  innovative  These features or products can bring us closer to our long term goals  In many cases solving a newly discovered user pain will be put here   Have you played with Sims  In Sims you always see your characters  needs  hunger  hygiene  social  fun   and you have to act if one of the needs bars turns red  Your product is just like a Sims character and these four categories are its needs  Of course we want to focus on user needs and strategic goals  but sometimes you have to take care of under the hood tasks too  You can tag each task with one of these four categories  and it will show which area you should focus on now  This will help you to make more conscious decisions when you decide what to do next   Summary  put customers back in the spotlight  As product managers our goal is to build products that people love  We can t hide behind methodologies  we should focus on the people we design and build for  So it s time to take back control  Always keep one eye on customers and never stop doing research  You can choose from the long list of research methods  Build a culture where not just you but everyone is in touch with customers  where everyone knows their pain and tries to solve their problems  And display these efforts in your metrics too  No one said it s easy  especially in big organisations  But it s possible  and who else will do it  if not us  the product managers,"[642 916 1253 1142 328 151 101 205 559 549 859]"

almost intuitive  Launch first  iterate later  move fast and break things   But if what you re taking on is big and cumbersome   updating from older technology to a new codebase  for example   that kind of advice has never really cut it   When we surveyed a handful of experienced product managers  we found that when the stakes are high  they re busy answering bigger questions    Is the cost of taking significantly longer to roll this out worth the time we lose in market     Are customers willing to sacrifice having an incomplete solution when there is a promise of more to come     Are there any potential downsides to not shipping the whole feature at once    And when an important new feature is too big to fit neatly into one complete release  they start planning a phased rollout   A phased rollout is a launch plan broken down into parts  so that you can develop and launch significant things like a feature set or architectural change in sequential phases  It gives you time to iterate your team s work for a better final product  but it also gives your customers enough time to lose interest in your big investment   So should you do it  Here are 7 product managers on how they approach the juggling act of a phased rollout   1  Robert Anderson   VP Product Management at IDERA  Q  In an agile world  when is the right time to put a phased rollout on your product roadmap   I look at a phased approach when the total work required is large and I am looking to deliver quicker incremental value to my customers   For example  a phased approach is ideal with an enterprise product when I m making significant performance and stability improvements to the product  However  I m also not promising users that we will deliver perfect product performance in one release  This allows me to measure the impact of Phase 1 so I can be smarter in planning Phase 2   I can also show my customers that the roadmap item is more than just a talking point because they can see I am putting my money where my mouth is   Q  How does the length of product development cycles factor into a Phase 1 Phase 2 approach   You should consider this when you want to avoid long development cycles  Long development cycles lead to disinterested customers and give you only a limited window to correct mistakes  You should also consider phased delivery when you want to gather feedback on a specific feature in order to refine and improve later phases   Finally  you should consider phased delivery when you re working on architectural changes  in order to limit the number of disruptive changes to your product  Users typically digest change better in chunks than one big change   Keep in mind that unless you re working with a SaaS product  your users may never upgrade from Phase 1 to Phase 2  So never deliver a product with phase 1 features that couldn t work independently of Phase 2   Q  What are your best practices for communicating a phased approach to users   I think that it is important to make sure you can articulate a clear  and simple  story to your customers about the outcome of your plan  Of course  the reality of what you deliver needs to match that story   Be open with your users about why you are not releasing everything at once and be clear that their feedback will influence what you deliver in the next phase if it helps improve your understanding of the problem   2  Nadia Barbot   Product Manager at About me  Q  How feasible are Phase 1 Phase 2 approaches in 2017   In a world of competing priorities  Phase 1 Phase 2 timelines are pretty common and often necessary  It can be tricky because stakeholders internally may want the feature to be finished in one swoop  but managing through multiple phases can be done successfully for everyone   Q  What s the perfect opportunity to launch something new in phases  Are there any risks   The phased approach is useful when you launch brand new features or integrations that didn t exist before  These often require a few phases to become a complete solution  but you can set milestones to help the team see progress  celebrate wins  and keep up their momentum through the next phase   Major UI changes or site relaunches are not ideal for phasing  Customers need to continue to be able to use your solution or solve their problem while you are launching your features  so phasing can be dangerous here   Q  What are your best practices for planning and delivering a Phase 1 Phase 2 approach   Since developers so often work in agile like cycles these days  my team has even separated the dev launch from the marketing launch  This allows us to quietly coordinate multiple dev launches while planning one big marketing launch for that entire phase   If you are launching something new that impacts user experience  you likely will have to grandfather your Phase 1 users into Phase 2  might need to give them the Phase 2 enhancements for free  etc   Build a measurement plan for each phase  not just the final phase  this is key to keeping momentum because you can show your teams and the company that you are hitting goals along the way  Collect feedback on Phase 1 as soon as it is out  and include time in your Phase 2 plan  alongside the new features you put in this phase  to make changes based on users  feedback  Communicate a ton  How will Phase 1 get us to our goals   long term vision  How will Phase 2 build on this   3  Larkin Plaeger McCollum   Product Consultant  Q  What are some ways to stay agile during phased development   A phased rollout plan can give you a false sense of certainty of your plans after the initial launch   It creates the temptation to not plan your product as thoughtfully as possible  because it s easy to add features to Phase 2 that aren t truly critical because the next phase feels distant  Conversely in Phase 2  it s tempting to rely on your initial plans rather than reevaluating with fresh eyes based on your most recent data and observations   When a feature set really does require a multi step rollout  you need extra discipline to stay agile  You also need to keep reevaluating your plans throughout the product development process in light of what you learn from the initial launch   When considering a phased rollout  define what features are essential to your product regardless of rollout strategy  If you and your engineering team still agree that multiple phases are necessary  make sure to stay alert during each phase to new information that can improve your plan   Q  What are the drawbacks of a phased approach  How do you avoid them   When possible  I prefer to think of a development process as a single launch of a product followed by ongoing improvements  rather than discrete phases  This may be a minor semantic difference but it helps keep your mindset agile and focused on learning at each stage of its development   Another danger of a phased rollout is that you lose sight of your core goal  which is to solve a certain problem for your user   To be successful  make sure you keep that core goal well defined and that you return to it at each stage of the project to confirm that you re still geared toward solving that user problem   Q  How should a product manager plan a phased rollout with their development team   Close coordination with developers is essential  Sometimes your initial product based take on logical phases is challenging from a dev perspective or would actually increase overall project scope  It s also important for the dev team to have a view of the long term feature plan to architect Phase 1 in a way that makes future additions easy   4  Michael Hopkin   Product Consultant at Lead On Purpose  Q  When is it a good time to do a phased rollout   The phased approach works well when the initial phase offers enough value that people will use it  It s much more common these days with the increased emphasis on creating MVPs   If the product is complex or if customers will not use the product until both phases are complete  I wouldn t recommend the phased approach   Q  What would you tell a colleague considering a phased approach   I d tell them to take a hard look at your market  talk to people companies and find out how they will use your product  If they re willing to get started with limited functionality  it s likely a good candidate for a phased approach   5  Virgilia Pruthi   Product and Strategy Leader at Amazon Business  Q  What s the best way to communicate a phased rollout to users   Roadmaps are super tricky  especially for SaaS companies  From my experience  indicating what problem you will be solving or a theme is a way to ensure you don t end up getting caught up in the solution early on   As we all know  these things can change  Focus on the experimentation and less on the roadmap language   Q  Should you specifically mention a phased rollout on the product roadmap   I m personally not a fan of anything other than a themed approach to features and architectural changes  Focus on what problem you re looking to solve  and articulate to clients customers what they can expect and why   6  Dave Mathias   Associate at TigerRisk  Q  What would you say justifies a taking a phased approach to product features or architectural changes   It is all about the customer  A phased approach is best when   A major segment of your customers would prefer features or architectural changes to be phased Each phase is geared at uniquely different customer segment and working on them in phases allows you to focus on one segment at a time   View a phased approach from the shoes of your current and future customers and you won t go wrong   Q  In what scenarios do you recommend considering a phased rollout   Generally I have used a Phase 1 Phase 2 timeline on a roadmap when balancing different customer priorities against limited resources  The key is to just make sure you break down each phased deliverable into a complete use case for a feature   If a product is not attractive to your customers or future customers until a feature or architectural change is complete  then a phased approach is not the right option   7  Michael Smart   Managing Principal  Egress Solutions  Q  When is the time right for a phased rollout   If you have a complicated feature that can be broken into story points that stand on their own  you have a good candidate for a phased rollout  If the feature has dependencies  but partial functionality will gain market acceptance  you can still consider moving forward with it   However  I would not recommend a phased approach for any feature that if delayed  might jeopardize the expected market acceptance or the expected market share growth   Q  Do product teams ever scrap Phase 2   Very often  phased rollouts aren t completed  There are other times when the additional story points just get dropped  If this is in response to a conscious pivot or new market insight  that s great   The Takeaway  There are always pitfalls to launching a new feature  but hopefully the experiences of these product leaders gives you a sense of what really needs your attention when you re planning a phased rollout  Got well defined goals  Development themes  Have you set up proper expectations your customers   Then you re already on the right track   This is a guest post by Matt Anderson  a product manager for a suite of mobile apps in Salt Lake City  UT and Alicia Dixon is Senior Mobile Product Manager at Hilton Worldwide,"[702 80 1253 1142 1417 494 365 183 13 431 325]"
703,training-dataset/business/361.txt,business,The Price is Right  Essential Tips for Nailing Your Pricing StrategyIf you won t take Price Intelligently Co founder and CEO Patrick Campbell s word on the grand consequence of pricing strategy  heed the wisdom of Berkshire Hathaway s Warren Buffet   The single most important decision in evaluating a business is pricing power   says the Oracle of Omaha  ranking it above good management   If you ve got the power to raise prices without losing business to a competitor  you ve got a very good business  And if you have to have a prayer session before raising the price by 10 percent  then you ve got a terrible business    Over the years  Campbell has seen startups and multinationals alike labor to perfect products only to casually raise their finger to the wind when it comes to determining pricing  In 2011  Campbell launched Price Intelligently to help SaaS companies  such as Atlassian  Hubspot and Insightly  boost revenue from and knowledge of their users  Before that  he held strategist roles in the private and public sector  helping Google s mid market advertisers grow their businesses via advertising solutions and serving as an Intelligence Analyst Fellow at the Department of Defense   In this exclusive interview  Campbell deconstructs and walks through the elements of a pricing strategy to enable startups to more effectively acquire customers  The foundational work behind pricing is to create  test and refine buyer personas so that they re mirrored on your pricing page  To do so requires a three stage process  define your customers  collect data from them and apply your findings  While these steps sound simple  the execution is not  Let s get started   DEFINE YOUR CUSTOMERS  Perhaps you re at a startup founded by people who ve never handled pricing before or who are launching a product in a new market  Your first step is to begin by building quantified buyer personas  which are data driven profiles of your target customers  The objective is to create categories of relevant and lucrative customer segments to determine the cohort that s most important to deploy resources to pursue  Here s how to begin   Target 3 5 buyer groups to test  Especially at a company s earliest stages  resources drive and determine decisions   If you re able to part with  20 000 to  30 000 to do a proper study of your market  skip to the next section  However  if that sounds like a lot to you  start small and pick fewer than a half dozen target buyer profiles   says Campbell   How do you do that  With an educated guess  In your early market conversations and preliminary prospecting  you ve had an inclination that you re selling to specific sets of people  Write down those groups  what you believe they value  what they don t value and their willingness to pay  Note the group that you predict will have the most revenue generating potential    Christen each buyer cohort with a persona  Campbell is a fan of buyer personas  as used and refined by marketing automation companies  such as Hubspot and Marketo  His rule of thumb is to use an alliterative descriptor of each segment that follows this pattern   group attribute   first name    In the end  these are people  not numbers  Humanize your buyer cohorts   says Campbell   They could be personified by function  such as Sales Susan  Marketing Malik or Engineering Ernesto  or by stage  such as Startup Susan  Mid market Malik  Enterprise Ernesto    This simple naming convention may seem silly  but it accomplishes a few  valuable goals   First  it creates a common   and memorable   language for you to easily reference your potential customer groups throughout your organization  Second  it allows you to define and stack each cohort quickly  Lastly  it prompts you to recall the diversity of your buyer cohorts  It s easy to imagine your potential customers as a vast ocean of people  this reminds you that each have distinct preferences  values and incentives that control their behavior   says Campbell   Assign descriptions   both demographic and behavioral   to each persona  Each target group should have succinct definitions that are relevant to your organization  For example   Startup Susan   She s pre revenue or hits  1M in revenue  She s not sophisticated with her processes yet  and is mainly focused on her core product   Mid market Malik   He s a mid stage company that s making  10M to  50M in revenue  He runs a team of 12 to 25 people   Enterprise Ernesto   He might generate  75M or more in annual revenue  He isn t likely going to use the product personally  but will more often be a decision maker   These placeholder descriptions don t need to be elaborate  but extensive enough so that you recognize them in the field  Identifying stage and behavior is a good place to start  Depending on the product  these descriptions might go deeper into what each cohort values  but the immediate objective is that your team can collectively understand each customer segment   Price Intelligently Co founder and CEO Patrick Campbell  The bigger reason to establish this customer categorization is to begin to tackle one s value proposition   I ve long believed that value is a spectrum  As human beings  we don t inherently know the value of a chair or computer  but give it value relative to the objects around it  That s just how we think  as has been proven out over years of psychological and economic research and studies   says Campbell   Given that  when you re looking at your customer personas   whether it s Startup Susan  Mid market Malik  Enterprise Ernesto or other cohort groupings   the value for a particular feature is going to vary drastically relative to the different demographic or psychographic attributes of each persona  That s why you need to first test your cohorts    Law of the jungle  Good surveys lead to good pricing  Bad surveys beget bad pricing  Simple as that   COLLECT DATA FROM POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS  Customer surveys get a bad rap in the startup world  Many dismiss them when they don t return accurate or sufficient results  but that s often due to faulty survey design   If surveys don t generate good data  it s often due to user error  There s a lot we want to know  but we make missteps in how we ask  We end up with 25 minute surveys with 45 different questions   says Campbell   Without thought to incentive or user experience  it s no wonder we get back bad results and lose faith in surveys as a tool  But  if done correctly  they can be very powerful    Price Intelligently has sent upwards of 15 million surveys  and has studied what s worked and not worked along the way  To start  Campbell recommends that you focus surveys to test two elements   features and price sensitivity   with a relative preference methodology  These should serve to test your hypothetical customer personas  The first survey helps rank your core features to determine relative preference by customer cohort  and the second focuses on overall price sensitivity   essentially a customer s willingness to pay for the product   Feature preference surveys  It s a challenge to extract people s preferences in only a few questions  On one hand  you can ask a multi step or multifaceted question  which are often time intensive and burdensome for people to complete  On the other hand  you could opt for a more simple  lightweight question  which may not return the depth of response you seek  Ranking questions fall into the former category and multiple choice questions fit into the latter   Instead  list a set of features to evaluate and hone in on the extremes  To test relative preference  ask two questions   Out of these five features  which one is most important   Out of these five features  which one is least important    In two quick questions  you get the pulse of what s most and least critical relative to other features that may be on your list   says Campbell   Now you have a strong sense of not only what will attract and repel different personas  but the features for which they feel neutral  You ve extracted significant context in a low lift way for the target customer and extracted another data point for your development team  Now it knows which features your target groups don t value or care enough about to influence different behavior or purchasing decisions    The other part of the equation is cadence   You ll get a richer  more current understanding of customer preferences over time than in one fell swoop  It s the difference between a time lapsed video and a handful of snapshots  It s more dynamic   says Campbell   We ve found it s most effective to send surveys with 3 5 questions every three weeks  than a longer survey every quarter  Shorter surveys can generate responses at four times the rate   or greater   at that cadence    One last point about relative preference questions  it s vital to ask what they most prefer  not what they most use   Usage doesn t always correlate to value  Note the features that they don t really value as well   say Campbell   Take accounting software  Invoicing is typically the highest used feature  but workflow and practice management are often much more highly valued  because that s the sticking point in their business  Just because a feature  like invoicing  is always present and used in a system doesn t mean that it will be the differentiating feature    Price sensitivity surveys  When you put out your questionnaire to determine your pricing  there are two parts that are critical elements  The first is your value metric or how you charge  e g  per user  per hundred visits  per thousand views  and the second is willingness to pay  which helps determine threshold pricing  Here s how to ask for each   For value metric surveys  use the relative preference methodology   You probably have some instincts as to what your value metric could possibly be  If you re selling an analytics product  you could do per user  per visualization  per gig of data or per integration  Let s say you have those four options to test   says Campbell    Set up a relative preference question with each listed as a choice  Send those to customers or prospects and ask  out of those four  where do you derive the most value from this product and where do you derive the least    Even before you do a deeper analysis by persona  you ll start to get a sense of general preference about the entire sample   Perhaps people don t really care about users  but they do really care about the number of integrations and most of all about the amount of data flowing through   says Campbell   Eventually  this helps you map out how you re actually going to charge  The implication for getting this right is if you get your value metric correct  your expansion revenue becomes less of an issue  All of a sudden your small  medium and your large customers naturally fit on a spectrum and you re basically getting them at different points of value along a demand curve  Without this  you ll end up charging Disney the same price as you d charge Price Intelligently  even though we act differently on our preferences    Another pitfall is blindly following traditional value metrics   In B2B  there s this archaic belief that per user is the best value metric  because everyone sold licenses back in the day  Companies sold by the seat because they were physically given a disk or had to grant access or make a data transfer to each user   says Campbell   When SaaS emerged  most people naturally kept the per license or per seat model because that s what was always done  But the challenge   and the opportunity   with SaaS is that you can be very flexible with how you re charging    There are a lot of different ways to test willingness to pay  but Campbell has had the most success with a simple set of asks   With these questions  you re not necessarily trying to get perfect price points  You re trying to figure out what the price elasticity looks like  You never want to ask someone point blank  how much should this computer cost   says Campbell   As I mentioned  our human brains just don t naturally understand the intrinsic value of an object  We know it s worth across a spectrum  I know my computer s more valuable than a pencil  so because of that psychological phenomenon  we should ask ranged questions    So  rather than ask how much a product is worth  ask these questions   At what point is this way too expensive that you would never consider purchasing it   At what point is this starting to get expensive  but you d still consider purchasing it   At what point is this a really good deal   You d buy it right away    At what point is this way too cheap that you d question the quality of it    That last question is almost more important than all of the other questions because you ll figure out your bottom limit   says Campbell   It s critical not only because of pricing  but trust for your product  I can t tell you how many times I ve talked to a company and people just don t trust its product  It does plenty of cool things  but it s five bucks a month  It just doesn t make sense to people  Now  those are good situations  because if you double the price  or increase it by a multiple  you ll see conversion go up   as people trust the product   and revenue rise    If you re unsure of the stretch of your price elasticity  pick up the phone and call a few early or potential customers   From those feelers or initial survey results  a ladder will start to form  You ll see that a good deal for your product is  100   which you could choose to optimize for adoption   and that you re getting expensive at  200  which you could select to optimize for revenue  All of a sudden  you re on the way to a deeper analysis  which will get more sophisticated when you get 50  100  200 responses to these four questions  But you ll start seeing valuable  directional trends as responses trickle in    Two Approaches to Launch Surveys  If that seems like a lot of work to release these two surveys every three weeks  there are other ways to gather this information   I know that running these logistics on a budget is challenging  so don t be penny wise and pound foolish  Even if you re starting out  and for  10 000 you can save 12 months of time  it should be a no brainer   says Campbell   I ll admit that when Price Intelligently launched  we balked at that kind of tradeoff  Cash flow s super important  but it ended up being more expensive not to get these data points on our customers  So don t be afraid to spend a bit of time   or a bit of money   on these efforts    If the issue is getting large enough sample sizes for each of your customer personas  there are a couple of companies that can help   Instantly  formerly uSamp  Fulcrum and a few other companies provide market panelists  so you can get responses from a soccer parent in Kansas or a Fortune 500 CIO  If you ve got a consumer product  there s no excuse for not doing this type of research   says Campbell   The audiences can be a bit more limited when you get into B2B enterprise software  as there s not as many buyers  but you can still use these services    If this still feels like too much of an investment  just start small   but don t expect a to get a full picture of your customers personas immediately   That may mean one question per quarter  starting with what s most preferred out of five features  Then the next quarter you do the four questions on pricing  Then the next you ask about the preferences for annual versus quarterly versus monthly billing   says Campbell   Like puzzle pieces  all of these will add up over time    What you want to avoid is the sudden realization that you need to be charging five times more than you are and the mess of messaging this reality to customers  So bite the bullet early and do a comprehensive study or start rolling out a small set of feature and pricing questions every three weeks early on  ideally right after you re hitting around  85K MRR   what Campbell sees as a good mark for product market fit and the time to really start scaling   Either way  don t make this more intimidating than it is  I pitched in to help my mother with a side project  a little quilting company  We re from the Midwest where quilting is a big hobby   says Campbell   I did some of her market research  Granted I do this for a living  but it took six hours of my time  end to end  I spent  1100 with Ask Your Target Market and got 600 responses  I had 600 target customers respond to a 15 minute survey that was 15 20 questions long  In no time  I got more research than most enterprise software companies have on her customer than they do on their customer    Don t spend more time deciding to do a survey than building the survey itself  Given the data it can generate  it s less of a constraint than you think   APPLYING YOUR FINDINGS  All the personas and surveys serve to fine tune one key area  your pricing page  How you showcase and justify your pricing is the culmination of all these efforts and the lever for customer acquisition  But to get there  you need to first grasp the price elasticity of your offering   Plot out Price Elasticity  After you ve collected your survey results  use the data to determine your price elasticity of your offering by persona   Price elasticity is a function of what your conversion is going to do relative to your price  In other words  it shows the demand for your offering changes as your price changes   says Campbell   Here s a simple example  Say the Sunday edition of the Wall Street Journal or The New York Times is five bucks  Now you could do a good price elasticity study and find that if you increase the price to  10  you might lose 20  of your subscribers  but you ll double your revenue  Then you have scenarios to compare to determine your price strategy    The reason why price elasticity is so critical for technology startups is because software doesn t have a finite cost  nor a finite physicality to it   You can build unlimited software and sell unlimited licenses  But your addressable market isn t necessarily unlimited   says Campbell   So if you operate in a space that has a limited number of users  then you need to make sure that you either acquire most of them to boost revenue or get the highest price per customer for a portion of them    Startups can use the data captured by the same four willingness to pay questions to plot an elasticity curve  Once you make those calculations  here s what it ll look like   Your price is the exchange rate on the value that you re creating   everything your team does works to justify the numbers on your pricing page   Behold  The Pricing Page   Once you ve mapped your price elasticity curve  you can now refine each buyer persona by their feature preferences and willingness to pay   Now you have an updated sense of the value for and motivation to buy for each group  You knew theoretically that everyone is at a different stage  but now you can track tipping points   says Campbell   For example  the very early stage startup that wouldn t pay  1 000 for a product that would solve a lot of headaches  may now  as a growth stage company  see the value of that price for the time it ll save  That s why you need to collect this type of data over time   to know when Mid market Malik s willingness to pay is actually five times that of Start Up Susan  which may change your entire strategy    A key step to monetizing users starts with how you set up your pricing page  Here are a few of the more common traps to avoid from the beginning   Death by check marks    Pages with columns of check marks delineating each package is the first sign of a pricing page that s likely built on little buyer research  They re often designed and organized with the products in mind  not the people purchasing them   says Campbell   It s not typically intuitive what the material difference is between the tiers  which is a big problem if you hope to have a touchless or semi touchless sale    Mind your 9s and 5s   There s much misinformation on pricing out there  Common gimmicks dressed up as  pricing hacks  include  End your prices in nines or fives  Or put the most expensive plan on the left instead of the right   says Campbell   Some of those techniques may make small differences  but are not substitutes for the basics and won t generate more customers over the long run  Avoid micro testing prices in lieu of more a wholistic process to build a pricing strategy    Use your customer personas as the foundation of your pricing packages   Remember those initial hypotheses on buyer profiles that you refined with customer surveys  Use those to build your different columns   says Campbell   Your customer should be able to go to your pricing page and understand the difference between each of the plans in under 20 seconds  Enterprise Ernesto should be able to find the enterprise plan  and self correct quickly if he s looks at Startup Susan s package    Here s a good example from internet video hosting and analytics company Wistia   Wistia s Pricing Page  A pricing page should be instructive and straightforward   Wistia s page is clear but not simple  and comprehensive but not crowded  It s immediately apparent that its price is based on two axes  per video and per month   says Campbell   Extra information is listed in a FAQ that s easy to locate in the menu bar or by hovering over one of the question mark boxes  It s not only descriptive  but gives context  For instance  the pop up box in the  Standard Bandwidth  quadrant not only explains that  standard  means 200GB of bandwidth  but that that allotment is sufficient for 93  of Wistia customers  The clean and compartmentalized pricing page shows that Wistia has done its customer research    When to Show or Change Your Pricing  Companies often ask Campbell if they should show their prices   Early on  many startups don t want to show prices   and that s okay  Most don t really know what they should charge  so they prefer to get intel by asking inbound customers some pricing questions   says Campbell   However  when you reach a point where you either want a touchless sale  then you need to show your pricing  If it s not a clear number  such as in Wistia s case  give a range  It doesn t mean your pricing is negotiable   just that it varies depending on the customer  On the Price Intelligently pricing page  we give direction  not a figure  We ll use a range  such as  20 30K  or a starting point  such as  packages begin at 45K   That allows people to self filter and qualify themselves so no one s time is wasted and opens a conversation to finalize the price    The goal of a pricing page isn t to win design awards  It should orient you like a mall map  not leave you in awe   In terms of adjusting pricing  the rule of thumb is to refresh it every quarter or two   A lot of people get nervous to change pricing because they don t want customers to perceive that they re paying more  The truth is that people understand that products cost money  but they need to get in a rhythm of how that changes as your product changes   says Campbell   As you improve your product and add features  show that those changes correspond with an increase in value and price   First  your recurring feature preference and price sensitivity surveys should help verify and justify price raises  so you re not operating in the dark  If pricing is adjusted on a regular basis  it trains your customers to understand that the value is going to be changing as the product is improving   says Campbell   The worst thing you can do is add so much value over the course of three to five years   even 12 months   and then all of a sudden want a big bump from your customers who have gotten used to paying a specific amount  That shock is what leads to pissed off customers and churn  not necessarily the higher prices    In reality  there s a lot of customers who are willing to pay more   They just needed to be coaxed into it over time rather than one big bump  So what should you do  Every three to six months there should be changes  but you shouldn t be effectively raising the price every three to six months on someone   says Campbell   Don t make people pay more for what they have  essentially lowering their value metric  Add in a feature to the enterprise tier and get people to upgrade  Or introduce a related plan with a slightly higher value metric and price  Those are ways that you can effectively make sure you re constantly evolving and optimizing your pricing    The one way to avoid any bad blood with your customers is to get pricing right as early as possible  so that you don t get into a situation where you re raising prices and knocking on doors to get survival money   You should be able to say to your customers  we ve done X  Y and Z  This is the effective new rate for this price and it s a long year value metric because we had provided more value  Some will say okay right away  most will consider it  and some will ask you to answer a few questions   says Campbell   It s not that you can t come back from a long stretch without a habit of price increases  but it may be painful  Remember how Evernote was free for many years and then increased its pricing to  4 a month  Their churn on their free users probably took a big hit  but also there were people who were reliant on it and paid  Don t wait as long as Evernote  and don t make decisions based on your freeloaders  unless you have some way that you re going to monetize them eventually  Gradual price increases help gauge that    These days it s a mistake to chase volume  It s so much easier to make 100 people happy at a higher price than to make 1 000 people kind of happy at a lower price   JUST GET STARTED  If readers take one note from Campbell  it d be to get started now  Don t wait for your product to be done to start sending out feature preference or price sensitivity surveys  After you release preferred features  don t get intimidated by conversations with customers about price increases  Whether it s early and just the founders or you have heads of product  sales and marketing  whiteboard your potential customers into personas  For each profile  assign your hypotheses of their preferred and least preferred features  as well as their willingness to pay  Then test your personas with relative preference surveys   whether that s on your own and quarterly with a few questions or with the help of companies that can offer market panelists  Apply your findings to create intuitive pricing pages so clear that your customers can see themselves in them    The benefits of a well researched  dynamic pricing page become apparent as customers find the right pricing packages for them and are open to price increases as new features bring increased value  However  clarity on pricing doesn t just benefit Mid market Malik or Startup Susan   says Campbell   It starts to unify the mindset and motivations of your team  If your surveys show that Enterprise Ernesto s feature will increase his willingness to pay or LTV by 50   there s a clear  synchronized rallying cry for a specific feature  With a prioritized target  the team knows exactly what and why it s about to build a feature  That s an alignment that you can t put a price on,"[703 1231 367 155 1332 1202

705,training-dataset/business/202.txt,business,What I Learned From Developing Branding for Airbnb  Dropbox and ThumbtackThere are plenty of theories for why YouTube became one of the fastest growing startups in Silicon Valley history  Julie Supan says the reason is simple   We sold the emotion    When she became the company s first head of marketing and communications in December 2005  she immediately hunkered down with its cofounders to decide what and who they were about  Unlike other video sharing sites at the time  and it s easy to forget now that there were hundreds   YouTube was built in Flash  every other product required people to download software   it didn t curate long form professional content  or take the celebrity driven approach that many advisors were suggesting  They weren t even particularly concerned about video quality   Instead  they doubled down on ensuring YouTube was a  stage for everyone to participate  specifically someone who was simply looking to have a human experience  to laugh  to share their talents  to learn something   My team focused on showing not telling by promoting videos that people loved   whether it was a video of otters holding hands  a young woman singing in her bedroom  a man sharing his stories of WWII  or somebody teaching viewers how to fix a sink  What we cared most about was how it made them feel    Celebrities and brands would follow  of course  as would that  1 65B acquisition by Google  But it was the everyday user who defined YouTube s strategy and introduced the world to a new kind of virality   Since leaving the company in 2009  Supan has become one of the most sought after branding experts in Silicon Valley  helping companies like Dropbox  Airbnb and Thumbtack craft their positioning prior to launch  Her first step  Identifying their target user the high expectation customer  In this exclusive interview  she explains who that is  how to find them  and why every startup needs to ditch generic platitudes and start speaking to the people who will really care   Position with Precision   Positioning is the big bet a company is making over the long term   says Supan   It s the strategy for building your business  product  and brand  It s the clear action plan that will translate into positive revenue  happy customers and a great place to work   Your position isn t your messaging or your product roadmap but it is the foundation of every decision you ll make along the way   Before you can embrace where you re going  you need to understand who you re taking with you   Identifying the one thing you do really well that is original and defensible is the first step  Then you have to align your business  product  operations and marketing to ensure that you are building precisely what customers need even if they didn t realize they needed it until it came into their lives    To kick off her positioning work  Supan walks founders through five key questions   Who is the customer that needs wants your service or product most   Why does your product or service matter to them   How do they feel about your product or service   What is its true benefit to them   Will your product exceed their expectations   The name of the game here is precision   If you re working with shared or autonomous vehicles  ask  if I don t have to drive my own car someday  then  what will I be able to accomplish now that I will get some time back in my day   says Supan   Or for that storage startup  If my life s work is in the cloud  how will that change what my workday looks like   Think about the customer who ll get the most out of your product  so you can speak directly to them   and bet on their emotion    What Supan sees more often than not  though  is the opposite approach  Early stage founders  eager to look good for that next funding round or earn enough to make it another month  go after every possible user  They launch their products with a chorus of generalities  We re going to change your life   or  Revolutionize X   in an attempt to be something for everyone  After all  the goal is to rack up users  and a DAU is a DAU  right   Wrong    Founders are told that they need to bring up their daily active users  their monthly active users  They need to make sure they have the right level of activity  They need to make sure they have the right level of retention  They need to have the right level of acquisition  It s a lot   says Supan   And they believe that appealing to every customer is one way of solving these problems    But Supan asks founders one more question an easy one to highlight the folly of that line of thinking  Could you do all of that on the product side    They will always say   Well  of course not    she says   Resources are constrained  They have to force rank what they can build  Well  series A  and B stage companies don t have the resources to target every customer  either  Be selective about which customers you speak to and which ones you don t     Moreover  a  see what sticks  approach in the early days can be a dangerous drain on your internal processes and staff morale  When a company lacks focus  that plays out in its day to day operations   Meetings run longer  decisions get delayed  People get frustrated not having a clear strategy that they ve bought into   says Supan    All of this means that you have every reason to do this work  to figure out your precise target customer for the short and long term  Even if it means taking a couple of months to really nail this down  What s a couple of months in the roughly 5 10 years you ll spend betting on this customer to build and grow the company    Enter the High Expectation Customer  The first and most crucial step to successful positioning  then  is to define your ideal user what Supan has coined  the high expectation customer     The high expectation customer  or HXC  is the most discerning person within your target demographic  It s someone who will acknowledge and enjoy your product or service for its greatest benefit   says Supan  That discernment is key  because this customer is also someone who can help startups spread the word   The HXC needs to be a person who others aspire to emulate because they see them as clever  judicious and insightful   The high expectation customer is a good consumer  They re someone who can be trusted to know the market and make good decisions   They look things up  They research things  And they have ideas for new types of products or services that can help them save money  gain time  get healthier or make their team more productive   says Supan   If your product exceeds their expectations  it can meet everyone else s    Consider who this customer is for some well established companies   Airbnb  This HXC is invested in being a good global citizen  and doesn t want to simply visit new places but to belong   It s the guest who wants to  live like a local  and experience Paris as if they are living there   says Supan   They re energized by the idea of staying in unique spaces and feeling welcomed  but are cost conscious  too    Startups like Airbnb that build a two sided marketplace guests and hosts  riders and drivers  buyers and sellers  etc  may be wrangling twice the people  but their process for identifying the HXC doesn t actually look that different   The company does have to take a position  While Airbnb will say consistently that the hosts are their business and that is true the position of the company is toward the guest  It s about belonging   says Supan   But there s no rivalry there  hosts relate to that position   They  too  want to open their homes to learn about different cultures  and increase their income to be more self reliant  They understand who Airbnb s guest is and want to welcome them   says Supan   And  many hosts are also Airbnb guests  which is typical of marketplaces where the top sellers can also be the top buyers  Messaging  in these cases  may change depending on which side of the marketplace you re talking to  but your positioning should not     There are more riders  joiners  attendees  viewers  customers  guests  and buyers in the world than there are drivers  organizers  creators  pros  hosts  sellers   says Supan   If you bring in the largest audience in the world  you will bring in the best video creators  Same is true for Airbnb   if you bring in all the guests in the world  hosts are motivated to showcase their unique spaces and participate in this new sharing economy    Dropbox   This one may come as a surprise  because people used to think of them as just a file sharing and syncing technology company  But the Dropbox high expectation customer is actually a person who wants to simplify his or her life   says Supan   They re trusting  organized  tech savvy  and looking for ways to get some time back in their day  They want to know they re covered  that someone has their back when it comes to their life s work  which is primarily in their computers family photos  videos  work files  school docs    That s not every Dropbox user  plenty of people just use their free account to share a file here and there  But that s the idea  your HXC should not be an all encompassing persona   The high expectation customer will benefit from the product s greatest attributes and spread the word  Then others will say   If it works for my tech savvy friend Lisa or if it works for Tishman Construction  which built the World Trade Center and was an early power user of Dropbox  then it will probably work for me    says Supan   Lululemon  Of course  companies outside of tech benefit from well defined HXCs  too  Chip Wilson  founder of Lululemon  described his company s two  muses  in a 2015 New York Times piece  Ocean  a 32 year old single professional woman  inspired his initial target market and was later followed by Duke  her 35 year old male counterpart  an  athletic opportunist    These weren t just demographic sketches Wilson understood his muses  his HXCs  down to their daily routines  Ocean  for example  owns a condo and likes to travel  She has about an hour and a half to work out each day  Of her  Wilson told the Times   If you re 20 years old or you re graduating from university  you can t wait to be that woman  If you re 42 years old with a couple children  you wish you had that time back    Julie Supan  Why Your HXC Isn t Necessarily Your Early Adopter  It s tempting to assume your early adopters are also your HXCs  but that s not always the case and failing to make that distinction can prove challenging to a young company   Take FlightCar  the airport car sharing startup that matched outgoing  car owning travelers with incoming visitors  The company s earliest adopters were its monthly car sharing customers those car owners who traveled extensively and were wooed by the notion that they could earn a guaranteed monthly payment for cars that would otherwise sit idle  accruing parking fees   Our early ads had dollar signs all over them   says Supan  who came on to help FlightCar shift its strategy and rebuild the product last year   While those early customers did quickly drive supply and volume  they weren t invested in the company s underlying mission   We built the entire model the business model  the operations model  the marketing model around a target who didn t embody the sharing economy  Those users didn t value their role or see themselves as part of a car sharing community helping people become more self reliant   says Supan   And when it came to helping FlightCar grow  they didn t care about that either  When there was a problem  they were the first to write angry Yelp reviews  They had no interest in helping the company improve its policies or being open to changes as the company began to evolve the business model and improve operational efficiencies  Because there was very little goodwill  the company was not given the benefit of the doubt as it expanded from one airport in the U S  to 17 locations    In parallel  another customer set was growing organically from the very beginning  which they called the standard customers  a very different type of user  Acquired by word of mouth  they were invested in the self reliance of the sharing economy  and embraced their role as beta testers of a new concept  They were excited to save money on parking while they were away and earn a little extra money while renting their car to a visitor who came to their town  These were the high expectation customers    They were the people that could have helped to create the right kind of growth  the customers that would promote a brand  spread the word over the years  and encourage others to follow and participate  But the model wasn t built for them   says Supan   It had evolved with the paid customer as the North Star  and the company worked diligently for nearly a year to refocus and rebuild the FlightCar experience from the ground up  Ultimately  the team made a decision to sell its newly redesigned technology platform to Mercedes Benz Research   Development North America  where it has become part of their innovation lab for global mobility services    Find Your HXC  It s no exaggeration to say that correctly identifying the target customer can make or break a young company  Founders need to take the time to methodically define their HXC   Do your research  This is not the time to guess or go with gut reactions   A significant amount of customer research is required to deeply understand what people love  what frustrates them  what they believe your greatest challenges and true benefits are  and what they wish for in the long term   says Supan   She advises startups to gather data by targeting the full range of customers   happy  unhappy  recent  early  active  inactive   across geographies and through no fewer than five channels  including   general population or decision maker surveys  single question and open ended surveys  single questions embedded into sales or marketing calls  phone interviews  customer service channels  product intercept surveys  app store reviews   You might even have to create new channels and build features to capture data as people are engaging with your product or service   she says   Equally important at this stage is what not to do   Don t ask customers questions about features or about your UI  Tools such as Usertesting com won t work for this kind of research  The people who agree   and are paid   to test products tend to be much more polite and less passionate about your product   says Supan   And if you can predict the answer to a question  don t ask it  You shouldn t cut your survey or interview short  but be mindful of people s time  too  I recommend letting the customer know that you are doing a survey to better understand how they feel about the product and that their thoughts will go directly into the company s strategy    Calibrate the data  And don t rush it this can take several weeks of your team s time  Looking at the insights gathered across channels  begin to identify the common themes in your data  Ask these questions to surface these trends   What are you seeing that was expected and unexpected   What direction are those results pointing you in   How does that align with your current strategy  roadmap and team   Define your customer  With your aggregated data in hand  it s time to start sketching out the profile of your high expectation customer  This is where you ll identify the specific personality traits and characteristics that define the target audience   If you ve designed your surveys well  you can often look to respondents  own words for a head start   One of my favorite questions is  How would you define the kind of person that would benefit from this product most    says Supan   When people answer  they usually describe themselves  It s a great way to ask the  Who are you   question while making people feel like they are describing someone else    Calibrate again  Before wrapping up  Supan suggests running through some final questions to make sure you ve hit on an HXC you can really live with   Who looks up to this person   Is this person someone people feel they can relate to or aspire to be   Can you put yourself in their shoes and see your product from their point of view   What would cause them to be disappointed by your product and what do you have to do to ensure this won t happen   Consider Your Customer s Mindset  Once you ve defined your HXC  you re almost there  To get the most mileage out of that definition  though  you need to put it in the context of the customer s past experiences their consumer ecosystem and the biases they bring to your product  Otherwise put  you need to consider whether they re coming to you with a growth mindset or a fixed mindset   If your target customer has a growth mindset  great   In those cases  users are incredibly open  They ve never tried this before  and they can t even imagine it can exist  Take the first time people discovered the most unique of spaces on Airbnb   Wow  I can stay the night in a windmill   There s no context for that so they are excited and amazed   says Supan   Other times  users will come to you with a fixed mindset  and it s important your product inspires and encourages them to reimagine what s possible and then delivers   Take Thumbtack  the leading online marketplace for local service professionals  Many customers come to the site thinking   Contractors don t call back  They re hard to reach  I m going to have to make 11 calls to find out if one is available    says Supan   Thumbtack is aware of this mindset having done extensive customer research very early on  The team is positioning the company with a  you can do it  approach  using statements like  Customers use Thumbtack to get millions of projects done quickly and easily     Having done that early research  Thumbtack has built and positioned its service to wow customers as soon as they request a pro to help them with their projects   When the customer promptly gets a quote from an available  reputable pro without having to place calls and do the legwork  they ve moved to a growth mindset and feel supported and valued by the company   says Supan   This customer is very likely to come back     You can be more successful and generate goodwill speaking in an aspirational way to the customer rather than anti positive messaging such as  This was broken before  but now we ve fixed it    says Supan   The goal is simply to guide the customer toward a spirit of openness so they can benefit in a positive way from change    To build anything transformative  you need a customer that s willing to give you the benefit of the doubt   Get the Team on Board  If that sounds like a personal relationship  in many ways it is  After all  you re going to be spending an enormous amount of time with this  person   Simply put  you need to like them  And you need your team to buy into the relationship  too    Brian Chesky  the CEO of Airbnb  has said   You have to become the person you re designing for    says Supan   The entire team needs to agree that this person is worthy of their time  In many ways  they need to aspire to be the HXC  too    There s no way around it  startups are a grind  If you re not building something you want to build  it s next to impossible to stick it out   I ve seen companies retool the entire company for a customer that they re not excited about  Sometimes  I ve talked to companies that don t like or can t relate to their high expectation customer   says Supan   That is really difficult  That affects the culture  That affects hiring  That affects the energy of people on the team their focus and commitment    On the flip side  nailing the high expectation customer can be game changing for a startup   You ll actually see a physical response from your team newfound energy if they agreed with and were part of defining the target customer  You ll see more urgency and a sharper focus   says Supan   A clearly articulated HXC can even help focus your hiring   In many ways  if you look at everyone that works at Lululemon  they channel Ocean   says Supan   When you get off the elevator for an interview at Airbnb  you re literally group hugged and welcomed  They define their customer in terms of love  caring about people  being a global citizen  and you need to feel that as soon as you step foot in the office    Hiring for shared sensibilities is not enough  though  You need to be deliberate about rolling out your HXC  and make this person a regular  familiar presence in the office   Create a presentation or cheat sheet that can be shared with the whole team  offer a tutorial as part of onboarding new recruits or develop a scorecard of how well the product is doing in exceeding this customer s expectations  Mention the HXC in all hands meetings  Consider convening a focus group or  user council  that reflects a cohort of HXC customers and run strategies and new features by them    Hit the Ground Running  Your work is not done  of course  once you ve identified your high expectation customer and brought the team on board  You need to incorporate that customer into the DNA of your company your strategy  product roadmap  operations and marketing   It can take 6 8 weeks to do this well and discuss how things need to be altered to exceed the expectations of your HXC   says Supan   In almost every company I ve been a part of  we were able to review the product roadmap with a sharper perspective  freezing some features and in most cases building new ones that better reflected our new position and HXC    When it comes to marketing  the good news is that the work you ve put in on the front end will quickly focus your strategy and messaging  Relieved of the burden of that  go after everyone  mindset  you can invest your sales and marketing dollars in acquiring and retaining a single customer target they ll take care of the rest   There s more objectivity in one customer sharing their passion and love for a product with another than there is in ads or promotion  It allows the company to spend less to achieve lasting growth   says Supan   Don t be afraid to use your HXC s own words  too  You invested in customer data gathering now mine the results for the language that will resonate most   Customers will hear their own words and say   Whoa  This product is for me     Keep a close eye on nonverbal messaging  too  including your product s look and usability   If Dropbox was going to say  It just works   for example  their product needed to work everywhere  across every platform  in order to exceed the expectations of their HXC   says Supan   Their design vision must also line up with how the target customer feels about the product  One of the brand values is  We have your back   And there s barely any UI with that product  It s up in the right hand corner  You almost never actually interact with it  It s simple and understated  but you know it has you covered    Targeting your messaging doesn t mean single mindedly sticking to the first thing you try  though   You do need to identify ways you can do some split testing on how that position is received by customer   says Supan   Look at every touch point  You re not going to overhaul it all in one day  but ultimately you want it all in total alignment by a certain point when you re ready to put a stake in the ground    The high expectation customer is the truest form of virality   Check Back In  At the end of the day  your HXC represents people real people  living in the world and you need to regularly revisit your target to make sure you re still hitting the mark  Supan urges startup leaders to remain keenly attentive to shifts in their company or their market  and check in when their gut tells them to   Maybe it s every two or three years  when you ve seen a certain amount of growth  At some point in the future you need to ask yourself again   How has the world evolved  and what does my customer expect now  How might they have grown      I look at Twitter  and while I wouldn t say they got their positioning wrong  I think they skipped the step of checking back in   says Supan   Early on  Twitter made the call to target celebrities and other media savvy types eager for a new way to reach their fans  It s been a successful strategy from a PR perspective  and those celebrity superusers have certainly reaped serious branding rewards  But the company s slow growth suggests that while regular people enjoy a glimpse of celebrity  that doesn t mean they ll actively use the product themselves    No one can aspire to be Justin Bieber on Twitter  He has come a long way since he was a 12 year old uploading homemade videos of himself singing on YouTube   says Supan   But I look at the Twitter product and say   If it works for him it will definitely not be for me   He s setting the bar so high you actually feel excluded  This HXC is not someone that people feel they can emulate or envision themselves to be    It s easier said than done  but continually surveying and engaging with your customers is well worth the effort   Employ someone creative and analytical who can manage ongoing multi channel research and work closely with the product team   says Supan   And make sure that you are continually calibrating those insights against the HXC  Rarely have I seen a company shift their HXC entirely over the years  but it s important to evolve with them and the world around you    The goal the first time around was to achieve consensus  and that s true the second  tenth or hundredth time you check in on the HXC  too   You re always working toward a state where the market  the company  and your customer are in broad agreement about what you are and why you matter   says Supan  As your company evolves  the HXC serves as a valuable touchstone to ensure that you re growing in the right direction and to validate   or invalidate   your action plan    The best thing about identifying the HXC is that everyone   from employees to customers   gains peace of mind  Your users will understand the product  and know that it s meant for them  You ll slash your cost of customer acquisition and enjoy the benefits of a clear roadmap  With bias removed  your team can be more creative   says Supan   Keep checking in with your HXC and calibrating insights against them  Keep learning about them  If you do the work  they ll lead you to consensus about what your company is and what it isn t    Photography by Bonnie Rae Mills,"[705 494 365 328 442 101 881 1332 703 1026 32]"
709,training-dataset/product/907.txt,product,From signed up to satisfiedConvincing potential users to sign up for your product isn t easy  But what happens next is far more important  The latest batch of billion dollar companies are built on making their users successful  and that means providing great onboarding  At Traction Conference  an event all about how to keep and grow customers and revenue at scale  I explained how to build onboarding based on your customers  goals  and why when your product improves  your onboarding must improve with it  You can watch the talk below  Prefer a written account  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the presentation  I ve been working with my co founders since 2007 2008  The nature of traction itself has changed quite a bit in that period  Way back when we were trying to grow our first company  which was called Exceptional  a Ruby on Rails error tracker  all we ever stressed about was the funnel  The idea of getting more things into the funnel was all we cared about  If we did enough of that  we d get rich  right  Through a constant series of failure and disappointment  we realized there is no one true way  There s actually a lot of ways and they all add up together to matter  We gave up chasing these mythical   grow your website with this one weird trick  things  There were lots of tricks and they weren t that weird  They just looked like hard work   Over time as an industry we realized there is no magical one way to become a billionaire overnight  You do a lot of work and hope people will eventually hear of you  Then you get them to your website  Our next challenge was  what the hell happens when they land on our website  Is this the right website  What could we do about that  Could we somehow get them to definitely sign up  We developed all these tips and tricks that would help us optimize what happens when they land  Most specifically  the industry came up with this beautiful idea of AB testing  This was around 2010  It became standard fare to find the best possible way you could lay your page out  which was a positive thing   It is fair to say that we learned a lot of good stuff  We also learned a lot of stuff we could ve worked out otherwise  Big calls to action outperform small ones  Calls to action in the right location outperform ones in the wrong location  Calls to action that are visible outperform those that are not visible  You d like to think we learned these things once  but as an industry  every three weeks it s like   We increased our conversions by 40  by making our call to action visible on the home screen   I m like   Good job  guys  We ll get there   As we ve tried to tackle traction at each step  we ve found ourselves chasing these silver bullets  We ve spent a lot of time searching for one of these  To paraphrase Ben Horowitz  it s actually a shitload of these that we need  Real effective things  not mythical weird tricks  The changing nature of distribution If there are no shortcuts in the top of the funnel  it just looks like hard work  There s no one certain way to design a landing page  it just looks like great design  preferably with a good product to back it up  Distribution has changed in nature because of these realizations  To bring us up to early 2014  you might be familiar with Product Hunt  You just go there every day and there s more to check out  It is effectively the app store for the web  but it s weirdly even more addictive  As a result  distribution got easier and easier and easier  We found ourselves in a world where a product like Yo  which let you send yos to people  gets a million users in four days  That is insanity  Meerkat had two million users  Secret had tens of millions of users  Whisper has 20 million users  What you realize is today there are dozens of ways to get your first hundred  your first thousand  your first 10 thousand  or even your first million users  so much so that Benedict Evans tweeted  A cool new messaging app getting to 1m users is the new normal  Keeping them  and getting to 100m  is the question    Benedict Evans   BenedictEvans  March 22  2015 That s where we ve found ourselves  that it s not just about getting everyone to hit your website  There s actually something deeper going on  That whole idea is this concept of retention  and it s the next frontier  We ve gone from how the hell can we get people to hear about us  to how the hell can we get them to sign up when they land on our page  to how the hell can we get them to stick around  That is the next funnel   the second funnel  If you want hype  bullshit  and press  you can hack the hell out of the first funnel  If you want to build a billion dollar business  you need to solve the second one  To give you a simple example  which of these two would you rather have  a million sign ups in four days  or a million active users after sixteen months  The first business is Yo  and Yo is gone  The second business is Slack  The question then becomes  how do we get from sign up to success  Intercom has grown like a weed since I ve been involved  which is August 15  2011  our incorporation date  It s been interesting to think about what we ve done right and what we ve done wrong  I don t look at Intercom and think that we nailed marketing or that we nailed comms or media relationships or virality  There are some things we got right  and it hasn t necessarily been about filling top of funnel  We realized early that you can have all the tactics in the world but if they hit your homepage and your homepage is bad  it ll go to shit  If users sign up and you don t have them doing anything useful after that  it ll go to shit  If they go through onboarding and your onboarding sucks  it ll go to shit  If you get it all right  they ll become a happy customer  at which point your new obsession becomes keeping them  If you don t keep them  they ll either leave or go to another customer which means  again  it ll go to shit  If there s one point you should take from this  it s that you have to work very  very hard to stop it all from going to shit   Onboarding is  in a sense  the new conversion  It s the new thing we need to think about  The question you have to ask is  what makes for a successful onboarding  I have so many businesses who will tell me things like our cost per lead is  10  Would you consider spending two cents to increase the chance that lead becomes a customer  They re like   That sounds expensive   You re literally pouring money into a leaky bucket otherwise  Onboarding is actually the challenge of getting people from thinking   what the hell is this product   to   holy shit  this is quite a product   The definition of successful onboarding When most people think about onboarding  they think it s the bit where we try to get the email  There s actually a lot going on with onboarding  Is it the idea of trying it out  Is it buying and paying  Is it being set up for success  or is it progressively expanding over time and learning about new changes  There is a lot to it  Onboarding is the new conversion  The biggest thing I find myself beating into the heads of either startups who I chat with or new folks who start at Intercom is this idea that if you re doing things right  you re going to ship a lot  If you re doing things really right  you re going to ship all the damn time  which means your product is constantly in flux  It is nothing short of a moving target  Every time your product changes  your definition of success for a customer has to change too  which means that every time you write anything substantial on your product  you need to reconsider what a successful user looks like when they land on your page  What are the things you want them to do  in what order  and how  Signing up for your app is literally the only thing that everyone does  You can tell me   We re going to nail our new calendar feature or export to Dropbox   I m like   Maybe if you re doing things really well  30 40  of your customer base will use that  Have you looked at this thing that literally everyone does   Most product owners sign up for the product once  This is the problem  When they signed up  they were literally granting themselves access to the product in a database somewhere  It s not the same thing as the funnel that you re asking and paying for your customers to go through  If you don t continuously reimagine what it s like to land on and start using your product  all this stuff goes out of date  Your product tour is out of date  your help docs are out of date  your welcome email is out of date  All that stuff will go wrong  which means that a neglected onboarding is actually net negative over time  You re literally pointing people to yesterday s ideas of your product  not today s  which means you re literally pitching them on the wrong shit when they decide to use your product  Meanwhile you have your product team working on some awesome stuff that users are never going to bump into  Never stop signing up for your own product  It should be someone s job to sign up for your product every week and make sure that everything still works well and makes sense  The current generation of billion dollar businesses are obsessed with onboarding  Slack built this incredible Slackbot  which does two things in parallel  it talks to you and teaches you how to use their product while collecting all the information  and then it suggest things that you should do next  and it works  You can argue Stripe s entire product is simply a much better onboarding for payments  They made it incredibly easy to start getting paid and did that through onboarding  They re famous for a thing called Collison install  In the early days  if you bumped into John or Patrick Collison  they would literally say   You want to use Stripe  Give me your laptop   and they d actually do it for you  That was how serious they took onboarding  The current generation of billion dollar businesses are obsessed with onboarding  Now  you can t onboard everyone  It s a mistake to try because you ll end up bending your product around everyone  You can only onboard people who have a need  a desire  and a capability  No two of these three are enough  If they need it and desire it but they don t have the authorization for purchase or they don t have the skills to install or whatever  then you won t be able to bring them on board  Similarly  if they want it and are capable of doing it but they don t need it  it s not going to work  That s like me going to look at Oculus Rift  I really want this thing and I m capable of buying it  but I can t justify it right now  Lastly  if you need it and you re capable of doing it but you don t want it  it s a hard onboarding  This is like me going for a tooth extraction  Yes  I need it  Yes  I m capable of booking one  but I don t want it  When to optimize and when to redesign The first wave of onboarding  going back five years  was simply pointing out the UI that we just built  because we need to explain it  That was onboarding 1 0  Onboarding 2 0 was like LinkedIn s style   let s give people progression meters so they know how far they ve gone  Modern onboarding requires you to understand your user s definition of success and break down the barriers to get them there  This is why tips and tweaks won t get you there  You can t always optimize your way to better onboarding  Optimization can very quickly become a black hole where you sink all your team s time and get literally very little in return  You need to know when to reset   Your product changes either a little or a lot  and your onboarding either works or it doesn t  If your product doesn t change a lot and your onboarding is good  that s a great time for optimization  If a lot has changed and it doesn t work  that s a great time for redesigning the whole thing  If things have changed a lot and you re working  you should probably go back and reimagine it anyway  and if your onboarding isn t working  you should fix it  There s only one great case for optimization  which is we re doing the right thing and we need to make it better  I ll give you an example from Intercom  We have to ask people to install JavaScript in their product  If you think a credit card form is a big barrier  asking people to install JavaScript on a live product is a bigger one  Our definition of onboarding was   We need to help people install the JavaScript correctly   We ve been working at this forever  and it got more fancy over time  When 2014 arrived  we had engineers  business people  videos  our chat room  etc  We had everything covered and optimized  At the same time in our product land  customers are telling us   I actually just want to upload users from a database   So we built this tool to upload users from a database or from a CSV  The product had changed  so the onboarding should change  We went from the saying onboarding is about getting people installing JavaScript to   how do we get people getting their users into Intercom   which brought us here   Simply doing that gave us a 40  kick in our conversion rate  which is huge  Most curiously  we found it didn t cannibalize any of our existing stuff  This was net new customers  It wasn t like all of our old people were going through this route  It was a whole new type of people we were getting  We had taken people who need it and want it but can t make progress  and we let them make progress  Now they need it  want it  and they can use it  That was huge  A relentless focus on high impact work  The work your growth team or your onboarding team does can be high impact or low impact  It can either be a lot of work or a little work,"[709 222 1214 1282 999 353 32 405 244 1239 427]"

729,training-dataset/product/1343.txt,product,The life of a Product Manager192 Flares 192 Flares    Osama Hanif  Digital Solutions Manager at Telenor  launched the first digital agency in Lahore and went on to join Telenor Digital  Last summer he and a brand new team were challenged by Telenor to tackle smartphone users  especially in Asia  who don t use data because of a fear of large unexpected bills  Osama s talk is a personal summary of what he learnt through the process of launching this and other products  He calls this talk  a note to self for my future endeavours  but is packed with insights to help you hack your own output as an effective product manager   Plan for improvisation  To tackle the problem faced by the  billshock  customers  Osama s team developed a pay as you go experience based on application usage  This app aimed to give the power back to the consumer and help them feel in control of their data usage  Osama and his team had planned absolutely everything in advance and had a detailed and gradual roll out plan  Unfortunately  none of the eventual outcomes turned out to be in the plan  When launching their MVP app to their internal employees in Thailand  only three people used it one of which was Osama  Not only did they have to challenge themselves why this was the case but they were also planning on using their internal employees as beta users to test their algorithms  The team had to throw their initial plan out the window and improvise by reaching out to the online community to find their guinea pigs   Launch as soon as possible  Osama s biggest regret   I wished we d launched a couple of months earlier than we did   He describes how they were delayed by improving smaller aspects of the product or adding little tweaks which cost them time in discovering bigger  more important issues  They had tested MVPs but in safer environments and so faced unexpected challenges in Thailand  Launch when you re still uncomfortable to launch because otherwise it will be too late   Marketing should not be an afterthought  Originally Osama s team had less than 1  of the money and time going into the marketing plan  For example  whilst they were fixing the bugs and making the user interface as simple as possible they had neglected the pricing  When they reduced the price for certain apps  their product uptake went through the roof  The product is the whole experience including the marketing  not just the software   The launch date is not the final goal  The launch date was not even a major milestone for the team but because they treated it as a final project goal  all the momentum that had carried them up until that point dissipated  This led to wasted time  Osama wishes they had kept the momentum and energy that they had before the launch and reminds us releases are a marathon and not a sprint   Test retention  When the team first launched the product they focused on acquisition but as they grew and started paying attention to their cohort analysis they could see the holes in the funnel growing bigger and bigger  Osama s recommends looking at retention and repeat use from day one as the biggest indicator of the health of the product   Test acquisition channels  Before you focus on growth  you need to think about how your product will travel  Which segment of customers really like this product  By testing different channels  you begin to identify the levers of growth and their costs  Once you ve identified these you can put more money into it to efficiently increase growth rather than wasting time and money on customers who are not interested   Measure both quantitative and qualitative data  Use your funnel analysis to identify the weakness to work on  Osama describes their work on the onboarding flow for their app  In developing markets  literacy and digital literacy is low so they wanted to build a product that is very easy to use  If a customer is installing a software Osama s team assumed they would already be sold on the idea and had removed the sales pitch in the onboarding flow  taking them to the first screen straightaway  When they checked their funnel data  they spotted a decrease between download of the app and sign up   Using this quantitative data  Osama did qualitative research  customers didn t understand what the app was after downloading it as they didn t read the app store description  The team re introduced onboarding and made it more visual and quicker  This led to improved sign up rate and retention  One lesson learnt here is to avoid over simplifying user experience and a second even more important lesson is how Osama used data to realise this   Don t promise something in your communication that you can t deliver on  Osama also used data to identify customers with high churn rates and interview them  He found that  as the rhetoric in the marketing communication described  unlimited internet   many customers thought this would mean  unlimited speed   The app had increased churn because customers were expecting a faster internet speed which it didn t supply  Osama s team decreased churn rate not by changing the product but by removing the reference about the experience of the internet from the marketing communication   Fail  Ultimately  the hardest and most useful lesson for Osama was that it is okay to fail  Most of us have had some success with traditional ways of doing thing and changing our methods exposes ourselves to vulnerability  to the unknown and to something which might cause us embarrassment  It s easy to see why it is so difficult to do  Osama discloses  even today I m still afraid when I try something new   But for Osama  recognising and acknowledging his fear of failing allowed him to embrace it  think through the worst case scenarios rationally and then make an active  courageous decision to try something new  The first most effective way to learn new things is to learn by doing  The second to discover what other entrepreneurs  like Osama  have done,"[729 13 549 1164 348 365 494 709 442 328 80]"
741,training-dataset/product/357.txt,product,8 Mistakes You ll Make in Your First Months as a Product ManagerHere are some mistakes that I expect most first time product managers to make   even after coursework  certificates  and online tutorials  New product managers may have studied the daily mechanics of the product development process  but are typically light on soft skills  product strategy  organizational savvy  and market insight   In your first six months as a product manager  you will probably   1  Promise a new feature to a customer without running it past your team   Especially in enterprise selling  the pressure on you is intense to say  yes  to whatever the big client is asking for  in real time  with encouragement from Sales and your execs   How hard could that new feature be  Probably only a few days  and fits into the next sprint   A big mistake if you and your team haven t sized and understood it  since it s likely much larger than it sounds and will certainly push something of similar scope down into the backlog  And will have to be maintained forever   2  Generalize your first three customer interviews into a market segment   It s tremendously exciting to get out of the building and talk with actual users  or customers  or prospects  You take listen  learn  notes  draw customer journey maps  watch over their shoulders as they use your product  And these first three customers have a lot in common  You don t YET know  though  which characteristics are representative of your intended segment   or if your segmentation is the right one  Try to hold off on major conclusions until you ve talked with a dozen  or three dozen  prospects and can spot the outliers   3  Confuse sales calls with customer learning research   When you re on a sales call  your only job is to help close the deal  The sales team has pulled you in to address a couple of product technical roadmap issues for a near to signing prospect  Your job is to help them get to YES without making unplanned commitments   See  1 above   Sales calls are not the moment for big picture  open ended research questions    What problems does our current product not solve for you  Would you rank these possible features for next year s release     Research discussions should be low pressure  exploratory  leisurely and humble  You ll need to set up talks calls meetings with current users  outside the renewal cycle   target customers  lost prospects  etc  And do as little talking  i e  as much listening and learning  as possible  Take notes  be appreciative   4  Believe your own marketing selling materials about why customers use and love your product   Marketing has simplified and homogenized testimonials from actual and imagined customers  then supplemented that with positioning and dreams  Some of this may have originally come from you  Don t breathe too much of your own exhaust fumes and don t believe in a marketplace as simple as Marketing describes it   5  Announce that you re  CEO of the product    Nope  You don t have hire fire authority over your development team  or control over the R D budget  or the power to change commission structures for your sales team  You have responsibility and influence  but very little authority  So sounding self important can antagonize the people who directly add value  developers  test engineers  tech writers  UI designers  dev ops teams  sales engineers   6  Tell engineers how to solve a technical problem   Don t  Engineers are hypersensitive to lowly product managers telling them how to do their jobs  Focus on framing problems correctly and getting the smartest folks solving them   Hint  not necessarily you   Even if you think you know the best answer  or used to be a developer  find humble ways to suggest possible approaches rather than pushing your solution   7  Postpone meeting your internal counterparts   It s easy to fall into a daily engineering focused routine  and respond only to other people who demand your attention  Folks who need your help will somehow find you  No need to socialize with other functional groups   In order to succeed  though  you ll need help from your equally busy peers in Marketing  Sales  Support  Sales Engineering  Finance and elsewhere  You ll be swapping favors  sharing information  demystifying processes  preemptively solving problems  and generally bailing each other out  As the new kid on the block  they may expect you to come to them   8  Confuse process steps  stories  tickets  releases  with market success  renewals  revenue  customer love    Someone following you around all day could think that your job is to write user stories and join standups and create financial forecasts  But that would be confusing output with outcome  Your user stories have to reflect an overall strategy for making users happier  not just be well written   you join standups to address blockers and keep the team focused on what s most important  not just to say what you did yesterday   you build forecasts as one tool for driving consensus and defining the economics of your product  not just as a launch checklist item for Finance   Your goal is deliver more joy to customers and more revenue to the company  which is the long term outcome of hundreds of good decisions  You re paid to think coherently and make good evidence based choices  not just follow a CSPO process map   All of this is why I strongly prefer to hire product managers with previous experience  But that s not always practical  So let s consider this from the hiring manager s perspective  probably a Director or VP of Product   She s just brought on a first time product manager  anticipates all of the above  and wants to minimize the cost of learning  She s also noticed that most of these mistakes are about soft skills and strategic thinking  not daily process steps   Our product leader might   Make an explicit training mentoring plan for her newbie  Jointly create 30 60 90 day goals that include customer research  cross functional introductions and priority setting  Assign a senior product manager as mentor  Schedule time every week for discussion  problem solving  mentoring  Provide fast feedback  especially in the first few weeks  on what s working not working  Focus on behaviors and deliverables and communication styles  not on personalities   Suggest a Myers Briggs workshop or other personality inventory training  Start on some small quick deliverables  and then move toward larger more strategic work  No need to dive into the deep end of the pool first   Avoid hiring a whole team of first timers  weigh previous product experience heavily in the interview process   SOUND BYTE  What we do as product managers is hard  and generic third party training isn t sufficient  We have to recognize the breadth of the role  evaluate our new hires for personal development areas  plan on lots of mentoring  and plan for typical mistakes,"[741 101

756,training-dataset/business/1013.txt,business,Why sales and support should be friends  not foesSales and support teams usually aren t seen as having much in common  In fact  at most companies a certain amount of tension between these two teams has come to be expected  When salespeople will say nearly anything a potential customer wants to hear in order to get them to sign up  support teams are left with the mess of having to readjust customers  expectations post sale  Salespeople worry that support won t follow through with their value pitch to customers  which increases the risk of churn  From a management perspective these tensions are exacerbated when sales folks are given a directive to bring in new revenue at all costs  and support is written off as a cost center  a position we don t share   Here at Intercom we ve reevaluated the dynamic between sales and support and created workflows that allow our teams to collaborate in ways that better service our customers  We also acknowledge that our support team spends more time talking to customers than any other team  including sales  Companies regularly squander the knowledge their Customer Support Reps gain from the hundreds of hours of conversations they have in just a single week  We incorporate feedback from our support team not just into our product  but also into our sales process  Here are a few things we ve learned along the way  Supporting the front lines Sales and support are the face of your company s 1 1 communications with current and potential customers  Demand generation drives people to your site  product marketing outlines the jobs your products do  and growth helps these people sign up  But the first human interaction people have with your company is with a member of the sales or support teams  With so much on the line these teams need clear workflows that remove any ambiguity about which team covers what  Support will own the vast majority of these conversations because their directive is to be on the front lines providing real time answers to leads and users who reach out via livechat  email  and social media  When the conversation strays out of the realm of a straightforward inquiry  the sales team steps in  Sales teams have to be selective about which conversations they jump into since the number of salespeople sourcing new opportunities  we call them ADRs  is typically a lot smaller than the number of Customer Support Reps  In addition to providing customers with a speedy reply  having the majority of conversations owned by support also preserves the bandwidth of the sales team by restricting conversations to topics where they can provide value   Sales takes the lead One of the workflows we re always trying to optimize and improve is the way we communicate with leads who initiate a conversation with our team  After running a few tests we established that our Sales team is the most appropriate starting point for all conversations with leads  Our research team found that leads place a huge premium on the speed of a response  but they are also more likely to have questions about which products are best suited to help them achieve their goals  how much the product costs and how to schedule a live demo  However  some of the people that write in as leads have in depth technical questions about how our integrations work  our API rate limits and other topics that are generally out of the area of expertise of our sales ADRs  At that point our ADRs are relieved to be able to pass the conversation over into the capable hands of a Customer Support Engineer  Context is key What does it feel like to be the lead or customer in the middle of this process  Do we risk alienating them by making them feel like they need to explain who they are and what their problem is over and over like a broken record  Nothing is more frustrating than being passed to yet another person who has no more power to help you than the last four people you spoke with  That s why a key step in this process is to provide context to our colleague to whom we are passing the baton  We do a lot of this through custom attributes we ve set up in Intercom with fields like  Account Owner    Monthly Spend   and a breakdown of which products and features this account has access to  When sales is passing a conversation over to support this data should be paired with internal notes that help take away the guesswork behind who the customer is and what they need help with  as shown below   Know when to escalate Because we don t believe in sales abandoning customers after they sign up  this workflow also encourages support to pass conversations over to sales when a customer raises questions about their pricing plan  is having a hard time finding value in a product or feature  or explicitly asks to speak to the person assigned to their account  Escalating a conversation to a salesperson allows us to work with the customer over a longer timespan to resolve the problem  This also ensures that our sales team doesn t have to worry about customers fuming about issues they re experiencing and these concerns never making their way back to them  Sales reps hate finding out that a customer has been unhappy at a later date  like during an annual renewal  when it s too late to make a meaningful impact on these issues  When support shares this candid feedback with sales  we can ensure our sales team doesn t lose touch with the end user  Collaboration with support improves our sales process Our support team improves our sales process similar to the way they improve our product  by providing feedback on where customers have expressed frustration or confusion around our product offering  pricing  or the value proposition of our products and services  Our sales team prepares for new product and key feature launches similar to the way our product and marketing teams do,"[756 1014 1247 328 484 1389 524 1026 1058 384 324]"

807,training-dataset/product/131.txt,product,How to Pick Winning Product Features   PM Insights   MediumHow to Pick Winning Product Features  I had a discussion with a group of product managers recently about differentiation and product strategy  We were reviewing my previous post   How to Pitch Your Idea for Investment   and we were discussing the concept of  winnable by us   When you re building a new product  it s important to understand why this market opportunity is winnable by us  In other words  what do we have that s a differentiator   either proprietary or first to market   that will allow us to effectively compete   In that post  I mentioned this about differentiators   The key with the proprietary differentiators or the first to market features are that they need to be valuable to customers  It s no use for a company to have a bunch of proprietary differentiators  or to introduce first to market features  if the customers don t care about them   In this post  I wanted to go deeper with the concept of differentiators  and discuss a framework that you can use to pick winning features for your product   A Framework for Picking Winning Features  When considering possible product features  you should analyze the feature from two angles   1  customer value  and  2  is it unique   Customer value   How important is the need that this feature would address for the customer  Is it high value  addresses a critical need   or low value  nice to have   Will the feature address a scalable critical need across most customers  or is it a niche feature that only appeals to a small handful of customers     How important is the need that this feature would address for the customer  Is it high value  addresses a critical need   or low value  nice to have   Will the feature address a scalable critical need across most customers  or is it a niche feature that only appeals to a small handful of customers  Is it unique   Do any of the direct or indirect competitors in the market already provide this feature  If you include the feature in your product  would it be unique   Once you have analyzed the potential feature from these two angles  you can use the visual framework below to understand whether it s a winning product feature   You always want to build products and features that are in the top half of the quadrant  high customer value   If you re in the lower half of the quadrant  your product design eng resources can be better spent on other features   Table Stakes  If something is of high customer value  but not unique in the market  meaning that most competitors already offer it   then it s  Table Stakes   These features are extremely important  and are the cost of doing business because customers value them and expect them  But they are not going to set you apart in any way   Differentiator  As much as possible  you want to be in the upper right quadrant   high customer value and unique  meaning that most competitors don t offer this today   Then you have found a true  Differentiator  that you should consider investing in from a strategic standpoint   Who Cares   The lower right quadrant is something that is unique in the market  most competitors don t offer it today   but it s also low customer value  This is a  Who Cares   feature  To the point above  this is a trap that a PM  or a startup  can easily fall into   chasing products and features that are  differentiated  and unique in the market  but are not valued by customers  We always need to invest in differentiators that are high customer value and unique   Waste of Time  The lower left quadrant is to be avoided as much as possible   low customer value and not scarce  These are  Waste of Time  features  and are probably the worst kind of features  Why  Because you re tempted to chase these features in an effort to maintain competitive parity  but they don t move the needle for customer value anyway  If you over rely on sales or even customer input  without understanding the  why     is this feature really valuable to the customer    then you re likely to include at least some  Waste of Time  features   So what are the implications of this framework   You always want a mix of Table Stakes and Differentiators   Sometimes  when you re entering a market where customers have existing expectations  it s tempting to focus entirely on Table Stakes  If you re only building Table Stakes features  everything you ve built is also available with competitors  not unique   and there s no compelling reason to buy your product   other than maybe price  So you will commoditize yourself if you ve only build Table Stakes features  You will never be able to command a premium price  you will always be subject to intense competition  Not a winning strategy in the long term     Sometimes  when you re entering a market where customers have existing expectations  it s tempting to focus entirely on Table Stakes  If you re only building Table Stakes features  everything you ve built is also available with competitors  not unique   and there s no compelling reason to buy your product   other than maybe price  So you will commoditize yourself if you ve only build Table Stakes features  You will never be able to command a premium price  you will always be subject to intense competition  Not a winning strategy in the long term  Can you turn a Table Stakes feature into a Differentiator  It s ideal if you can pivot features that are considered Table Stakes into being somewhat of a Differentiator  It s important to ask yourself every time you re considering a Table Stakes feature  is there anything we can do to put our own twist on this to make it unique and valuable   iMac in 2001  Competitor monitors in 2001  As an example  when Apple introduced the iMac in 2001  computer monitors were considered Table Stakes  The Apple team asked themselves what they could do to take the Table Stakes feature   a gray  bland computer monitor   and make it unique  In doing so  they appealed to design conscious consumers who appreciated the aesthetic and ability to personalize their computer monitor   They were able to take something that is high value to the customer  monitor  but at the time was a Table Stakes feature  and pivot it to make it unique and turn it into a Differentiator  And hence  they were able to compete the with multitude of commodity PC makers out there   Proprietary v  First to Market Differentiators  A Differentiator can either be Proprietary or First to Market  The key difference between the two is whether the Differentiator is easy to replicate or not   What makes a Differentiator difficult to replicate  proprietary   Some examples include   Valuable proprietary data  Algorithms  trade secrets  patents  Established brand  The more Proprietary Differentiators that a company has  the harder it is for competitors to replicate  and the longer the company can operate in a market without facing direct competition   Having First to Market Differentiators are also valuable  As I wrote in  How to Pitch Your Idea for Investment    This is the classic  first mover  advantage  which can enable a company to build up an installed base of customers  build its brand and strategic position  and set the standards and expectations in a new market  This first mover advantage can become especially powerful when there are high switching costs for customers  or when there are network effects to a business   But I would always choose Proprietary Differentiators over First to Market ones  The reason is that if you only have First to Market Differentiators  unless your execution is perfect and your competitors are asleep at the wheel  the competition can eventually catch up to you,"[807 1253 325 1215 1184

850,training-dataset/product/997.txt,product,The Challenge of Managing70 Flares 70 Flares    When developing products  customer insight is vital to understanding the critical question  where are we going  Insights can help us better to understand our product and how it fits into the everyday lives of users   users who live in an age of abundance  where every product competes for a minute of attention  But insights too fall into our cultural condition of excess   From focus groups to customer service feedback to analytics to surveys to personal experience  product teams swim in an ocean of information coming from various functional teams  But synthesising information into insight is an art form and an exercise in restraint  Information can only tell us so much   finding the relevant information and contextualising it given certain complexities and nuances to turn it into insights is a challenge   As a product manager  navigating the deep waters of information overload requires an acute awareness of politics  an understanding of methodology  and solid communication skills  And all that is doubly true when it comes to sharing your insights and using them to inspire action across the business   Alter the Egos  It would be na ve to assume functional teams don t have their own agendas for product innovation  When knowledge is power  information retrieval is the road to a coronation  For product managers standing at the intersection of business  technology  and user experience  it s a screaming match from functional teams fighting to be heard  Be they user researchers  data analysts  market researchers  or customer service agents  every team is fighting to legitimise their job role  and livelihood    The best way to manage the cacophony is to acknowledge the benefits of each team s research in a weighted and measured manner  This makes them feel like their work is valued and recognised  But in order to do this  an understanding of what their research and insights offer is imperative   Size Up Your Sources  Functional teams can use a myriad of research methodologies  but some are more common than others  All methodologies are used to measure and glean specific types of insights and have limitations   User Experience teams often use user interviews to test and explore  A common practice for testing is to test with five  average  users  as results are said to yield diminishing returns beyond this  But usability is not the same as user research  User interviews are also common practice among User Experience teams to understand market behaviour  While usability may be more easy to extrapolate  insights gained from small user interviews are not necessarily applicable to the greater population  What can be extracted from small interview groups is a range of viewpoints and in depth information   Marketing teams  on the other hand  often rely on surveys and other forms of quantitative data that offer different insights on users  But these methodologies generally test pre defined concepts and lack the depth and range of opinions offered by users  Sometimes  marketing can conflate survey insights with user generated opinions   Data analysts investigate volumes of data from user tracking within products  e g  apps   This data offers highly detailed information  and in large scale  about user behaviour  But the motivations and intentions are not always clear  Generally  what the data shows is what the users did  not why they did it   Customer feedback is equally important  getting unprompted  unmediated opinions about your product  While the sample population can be skewed towards vocal minorities and problem users   often seen with aberrant requests  frequently reported problems can show early indications of problems or desires   When a product manager has a good understanding of research  it becomes easier to communicate the value of insights brought for by each team  An awareness of the design and implementation of methodology is beneficial in evaluating weight of findings   Retracing Steps  Insights are yielded by combining the information from user experience  marketing teams  data analysts  and customer feedback  among other sources   Together  they cobble together an almost complete picture  For example  when launching a new feature  using insights across multiple teams can help measure its success in the pre  and post launch phases   Different teams will have different measures for what  success  looks like  and by acting as a bridge between them you can not only work to unify them towards a coherent view of product success  but also get their buy in as you work towards your product vision  It s crucial to remember that Information and insights you ll gain are cyclical  and should feed back into the ongoing product development process to not only inform your next steps  but to reframe your understanding of your users  and keep everyone aligned   Pre Launch  Gather user research and understand your users  needs  Baseline questions can be gathered from previous customer feedback  market research surveys  or conducting a few pilot interviews to see what opinions are expressed  Work with development and prototyping  and test through usability research to see whether the solution and feature created solves the identified need  Post Launch  Through data analytics  track the usage of the launched app  Corroborate data against marketing teams to see if increased usage was only due to heavy promotion of the new feature  Check customer feedback to see if there are bugs and other issues  or if there are only rave reviews    be naturally suspicious of seemingly perfect reviews    Cross reference user tracking data against the opinions expressed in user research  Survey a subset of users on their satisfaction and use of the product and feature at an appropriate time post launch  timeframe dependent on the product   When users behave contrary to the intended design  it is useful to re evaluate the collected information to see where there may be a miscommunication  misunderstanding  or misinterpretation between users and product teams   Selective Show and Tell  You don t need to drown others in data to show them your ocean of information   a map of the key islands of insight will suffice  While good teams will involve product managers in the process of user research or provide raw data  in silo ed corporate environments that is a privilege  and not a right  Product managers must learn to synthesise information in its given shape and form  and present it in meaningful and relevant ways back to their teams and to their stakeholders,"[850 859 431 549 502 378 916 328 13 999 348]"
859,training-dataset/product/368.txt,product,After running 2 000 experiments for Fortune 500 product teams  here s what we learnedThe  Lean  movement has taken the corporate world by storm  but there are still countless barriers for product teams that seek to adopt its experiment driven ethos and make decisions informed by customer data  That s why two years ago we started building Alpha  a platform for Fortune 500 product teams to turn hypotheses into customer insight within 24 hours without having to tap any internal capabilities or navigate compliance obstacles  In the process  we ve learned a considerable amount about corporate culture  the nature of user research  and product management processes   Today  our clients include forward thinking product teams from AT T  Capital One  PwC  Aetna  and many others  Recently  they collectively surpassed 2 000 experiments on our platform  After generating roughly 660 prototypes  they got feedback from nearly 400 000 users  The result  46 000 minutes of video from moderated and unmoderated interviews  6 500 charts  and hundreds of undoubtedly brilliant   and informed   product decisions   We spent some time mining our databases  for what we call  experimetrics   and reflecting on client conversations to extrapolate what we ve learned along the way  Below are the seven most meaningful and actionable insights we found   1  Change is difficult  The old adage is painstakingly true  As a startup  we have to keep in check our myopic perspective of the world   talking to customers may be an organic part of our job  but  as we learned  that s rarely the case at a large organization   Despite long believing in the value of rapid prototyping and experimentation  Fortune 500 product managers generally operate in environments with many competing priorities  User research is typically expensive and executed by internal teams or agencies in monthly or quarterly cadences  The ability to turn around research in less than a week  yet alone a day  is completely unheard of   And while  on demand user insights  sounds appealing  in practice it challenges many corporate conventions  the most entrenched of which is the bias to overplan  When research cycles take months  it s critically important to make sure that each aspect is carefully crafted and vetted  But when you accelerate that process to a matter of hours or days  iteration eliminates the need for exhaustive planning   Our data illustrates how difficult this change in mindset and behavior can be  At full capacity  individual product teams execute about 8 12 experiments per month on our platform  Even with workshops and extensive onboarding  it takes anywhere from three to six months for clients to reach that bandwidth  Sure  some of that time is spent figuring out how to quickly turn data into decisions  But the overwhelming majority is consumed as a product team culturally and practically shifts from waterfall to agile experimentation  recognizing that planned research pales in comparison to iterative research  Spending two weeks outlining customer research that will inevitably be flawed is no match for six iterations that can be executed in the same timeframe   On our podcast  This is Product Management  Cindy Alvarez  Director of User Experience at Yammer  echoed one of the most common sentiments about practicing  Lean  and  Customer Development  within a large organization  She urged listeners to stop planning and just go start talking to customers because it s impossible to get better at doing it otherwise   She s absolutely right and it s a strategy we are heavily invested in  We started pre populating new client accounts with research executed for them  including customer insights into competitive benchmarks and usability across their respective products  So far it s been a helpful ignition for product teams to begin iterating   2  Sometimes  formality trumps informality  Continuing the theme from the previous insight  we ve learned that  even once clients hit full speed  it doesn t quite resemble the cadence of how startups practice experimentation  We initially designed the product so that any stakeholder could easily submit an experiment on an ad hoc basis  which is similar to how we operate  Instead of running impromptu experiments though  our clients submit experiments in batches  often weekly   And it turns out there s a good reason for this  While a fluid workflow makes sense in a startup  it typically doesn t within a large organization that has various stakeholders with different  and often competing  objectives and projects  Product managers diligently consult these stakeholders when explaining customer feedback and deciding on next steps  A predictable and recurring cadence is often necessary to keep everyone on the same page   That s why concepts like the  design sprint  have taken off  they allot time for stakeholders to get aligned  We re embracing the role that formality plays here  and now encourage clients to organize  experiment sessions  on a regular and consistent basis  so long as those sessions end with testable hypotheses   3  Product experiments can be grouped into discrete categories  Before we could create a platform and workflow to accelerate user research processes  we had to better understand the types of research product teams need in the first place  That s why  before writing a single line of code  we conducted the first 500 or so experiments manually using third party tools   We found that user research experiments involving prototypes  as opposed to doing experiments in a production environment  generally fall into one of six discrete categories  One of them  usability testing  has a widely accepted definition  We had to delineate the others though  and while our definitions are by no means gospel  they suffice surprisingly well  requiring only modest ongoing revisions  Each category is accompanied by  rules of thumb  and a suite of configurable experiment templates  which you can read about in our guide to prototyping  but here is an overview of each   Here is a breakdown of the popularity of each test run on our platform   We have plenty more research to do  but these working definitions enable user researchers in our exchange to take virtually any client request and turn it into an executable study within minutes   4  All research is biased  Our offering primarily includes testing in what we call a  simulated environment   The users who provide feedback know that they are part of a study and are paid for their time  They interact with high fidelity  interactive prototypes  and generally understand that the products have not been engineered and released to the market   We specialize in this type of testing because product teams can learn a tremendous amount from it while complying with their organization s existing processes and risk tolerance  No internal engineering or design resources are required  no valued customer becomes the victim of a half baked product  and no legal department needs to be consulted  Of course  the data is not as reliable as what you d learn from shipping a product   All research  including ours  suffers from a degree of bias  But acknowledging such isn t an excuse to avoid doing user research altogether  It s an argument for the opposite  to fervently do even more research and attempt to minimize the bias across it  Thinking otherwise is missing the forest for the trees   One of the core principles of the scientific method is the concept of replicability   that the results of any single experiment can be reproduced by another experiment  We ve far too often seen a product team wielding a single  statistically significant  data point to defend a dubious intuition or pet project  But there are a number of factors that could and almost always do bias the results of a test without any intentional wrongdoing  Mistakenly asking a leading question or sourcing a sample that doesn t adequately represent your target customer can skew individual test results   To derive value from individual experiments and customer data points  product teams need to practice substantiation through iteration  Even if the results of any given experiment are skewed or outdated  they can be offset by a robust user research process  The safeguard against pursuing insignificant findings  if you will  is to be mindful not to consider data to be an actionable insight until a pattern has been rigorously established   That s why we make sure that for almost every experiment  qualitative and quantitative research is conducted  Further  we strive to generate insights that are comparative   it s rarely enough to learn what users think of a prototype in a vacuum  In the real world  users have an array of options to satisfy any given need  so we make sure that feedback on a solution is always relative to an alternative  Combining and optimizing these two approaches has greatly minimized bias  and often leads to a plethora of data from which to identify patterns and insights  And  of course  we stress the importance of incorporating other data inputs  like traditional market research and in app analytics   5  User feedback never ceases to surprise us  You would think that after generating data from hundreds of thousands of users  we d have  seen it all  when it comes to feedback and insights  But that isn t even close to true  We continue to be surprised by what we see on a daily basis  primarily with regard to    the difference between what users say and what they do   It s been well established that humans are pretty bad at predicting their future behavior  We ve researched the psychology of that dynamic extensively  But it s still surprising when we find virtually unanimous support for a feature in a survey and subsequently find absolutely no interest in the feature once it s prototyped  Putting a visual stimuli in front of your target market is absolutely essential for substantiating findings    the sincere emotions expressed   Market trends change rapidly and product teams are in a constant hustle to keep up  Few things get them to drop what they re doing and sit silently as well as watching a video of an emotional user interview  We ve witnessed a senior citizen cry profusely as they interact with a prototype that invokes nostalgia  We ve giggled as a Millennial described how much they hated a product concept and all the things they d rather use instead of it  We ve been shocked by a gentleman who opened up about how a new product could help him rebuild relationships with his kids  User research is truly an emotional rollercoaster    the validation of passionate enthusiasm   One of the most common questions our clients ask is   How do we know when we ve validated a product concept with customers   While we don t have any hard and fast rules  we ve half joked about applying the  Pok mon GO Benchmark   For fun  and because we re addicted to the game   we executed research against a few hundred users of the mobile game  The responses were impressively enthusiastic and exemplified patterns to look for when assessing validation  Players gave detailed feedback to open ended questions  spent significant time engaging with prototypes  and routinely offered to pay for new features we designed  Obviously  every product doesn t need to be a meteoric hit to find success  but evaluating outliers like Pok mon GO serves as a powerful anecdote   The key takeaway is that even when we think we know a user segment really well  research findings are rarely predictable or obvious  You simply can t underestimate how difficult and rewarding having empathy can be   6  Shorter iteration cycles unlock deeper insights  When our initial clients finally starting rapidly running experiments on Alpha  it became clear why generating meaningful customer insights is often so elusive for companies that take months to execute research  Speed in and of itself is the key   When iteration cycles are slow  product teams prototype and experiment until they generate promising results  The moment they get the slightest sense that they ve struck gold  they start engineering a solution  if they haven t already started   In essence  they learn  what  resonates well  but they don t have the time to learn  why    But when we accelerated the research process to days  we found that clients were no longer content once they validated a product concept  They finally had the time and bandwidth to ask  why  a prototype was perceived as more valuable that earlier iterations or alternatives  To keep up  we had to build out an extensive qualitative workflow so that we could go back to a sample of users that tested a product and ask them open ended questions  In doing so  we were able to unlock  deep insights    We define a deep insight as a comprehension of a customer persona that is so robust that its value transcends the individual project that a product team is working on  It is useful to anyone in the organization who is focused on delivering value to the same market  Instead of merely understanding that customers prefer your prototype with an expensive one time purchase compared to a cheap monthly subscription  you conduct interviews to learn why and discover that customers are actually afraid of forgetting to cancel their subscription  That s an insight that is so meaningful  it can be applied to other products in your organization s portfolio  And it s made possible by speed   7  Data is a means to an end  It s easy to get lost in the buzzwords du jour rather than to do the hard work of discovering value and driving ROI  We learned quickly that to build a successful platform  we d have to deliver to product teams more than the ability to be  data driven    Initially  our assumption was that data that clients generated within Alpha would translate directly into better product decision making  That s true to an extent and it certainly matters to the organization as a whole  But when we really investigated what was going on  we found that being data driven isn t really what product managers want or need   We listen intently to how our clients communicate the value of our platform and experimentation to peers at other organizations  Frequently  they mention how it aligns their team around hypotheses rather than opinions  Instead of two hour meetings filled with debates  the team spends 15 minutes putting hypotheses into Alpha and then 15 minutes reviewing the findings when they re ready  One product manager discussed how he uses Alpha simply because the data gives him a reason to email his director an update once a week  Another spoke about how thrilled he is to influence other departments to recognize the value of iteration and learning   Of course  data is critical to enabling all of these benefits  but it s a means rather than an end  And that matters because it informs our product roadmap  For example  early on we didn t put much effort into the data visualization of research findings  But now we understand that presentation is just as  if not more  important than the underlying information  because it s going to be shared and used to influence stakeholders  Recognizing how product managers must manage upward  sideways  and downward led us to prioritizing features like reporting and sharing      We ll continue to update this list as we learn more  If you re as passionate as we are about experimentation and customer insights  join our team  Or give Alpha a spin and start making smarter product decisions,"[859 850 1147 328 502 431 494 365 642 1253 549]"

empathy  you relate to and understand how somebody is feeling  but maintain an outside perspective  Emotional empathy is different  It s a fully experiential state where you feel the person s feelings   you feel their actual frustrations  But how can having both cognitive and emotional empathy enable you to create great support content   1  Cognitive empathy  understand how your customers feel  Surround yourself with customer information  To understand more how customers perceive your product  what they love about it  and how they use it  you need to surround yourself with information about exactly that   Harley Davidson take this seriously  Dev Pentnaik describes the scene in his article on empathy in the workplace    Walking down an aisle of otherwise ordinary office cubicles  you re confronted by an endless display of photos and signs from famous bike rides and exquisitely painted motorcycle gas tanks  On one wall  snapshots capture scenes from one employee s recent bike trip down the coast of California  Other walls proudly display banners and photos from rallies and other events  including the pilgrimage that hundreds of thousands of riders make every year    The goal at Harley Davidson is not to show off what amazing products they re selling  The goal is to create a working environment where it s impossible not to learn about their customers  lives   We do the same thing here at Intercom  As you enter our office you ll see posters describing who our individual customers are  what their business does  where they re located  what they look like  but also which Intercom products they own  what they use them for  and what they think about them  good and bad   Other ways we connect with our customers  and their frustrations is through customer days  where we each join the support team for a day   frequent surveys  conversation analysis  and lots of 1 1 user interviews   Stay on top of your product s evolution  This is far more than just keeping track of what new features you release  Rather  you need to fully understand exactly why features were built  and what problem they solve for your customers   Talk to your research and design teams to understand the motivations behind the design  Talk to your support team to understand any customer issues with it  And talk to you engineering team to understand its limitations  Use this knowledge to create help content that will communicate that you ve tried to understand your customers  goals and frustrations   Here s an example  When we built our User Map  the design team discovered that people were using it in ways we never intended  So we improved its design to match how people were actually using it   So here on the product education team  having spoken to our designers directly  and understood their motivations  we were then in a far better position to support the feature with content  which recognized the kind of jobs people used the map for   Your map is ideal for showing off how many customers you have at trade shows  and where they all are in the world  The user map is also ideal for impressing potential investors  without exposing sensitive data about your user base   2  Emotional empathy  feel the pain your customers are feeling  Experience a world without your product  If you re creating content describing a solution to a problem you ve never experienced  you ve gone wrong along the way  You need to immerse yourself in the world your new users are coming from   a world without your product   Immerse yourself in the world your new users are coming from   For example  imagine a world where someone wasn t using Intercom Engage to send targeted email and messaging campaigns  hard to believe  right     First they d have to try and sketch a long and complex decision tree of all the potential outcomes and dependencies for each message  Then they d have their colleagues look over it for mistakes  input all the data into an automated marketing tool  and probably have an expert configure it  And even then there s no guarantee that the right people get the right messages at the right time   particularly if the user s response to a message hasn t been anticipated in advance  It s time consuming  complicated  and frustrating   But by researching and and completing this workflow  and by experiencing the complexity  we re in a far better position to write empathetic content around the problem  Our Smart Campaigns content in this case says   Anyone can create a targeted rich message campaign in minutes  There s no headache inducing decision trees  and no complex configurations  Rather than trying to guess the pathways people might take in your product  Smart Campaigns will adapt the order of messages to match user behavior  Here s how    If you ve experienced the issue you re writing about  you ll build rapport with the user  and you ll write effective content  with compassion   Don t ignore the broken windows  We re lucky at Intercom that we re in the same business as lots of our customers  We get to use our product as users every day  so we re always on the lookout for bugs  We have posters hanging around our office that say  If you find something broken  you now own fixing it,"[864 372 328 156 1214 1282 1338 1002 322 1014 32]"

service  not even the best idea can save a failing startup  However  Arjun Setia of ProofHub has written a guest post that describes some tried and true tactics to help your company attract new customers and  even better  keep them coming back   Business is a numbers game  How much revenue was generated  How many new customers wereacquired  These are the questions that run on every business person s mind  And why not  After all everyone in a business is there to earn money  And getting more customers is the first thing that comes to mind when someone says making more money for a business  But in this post we are going to talk about a different perspective of business   For a few minutes let s focus on the sentence    How many new customers wereacquired   The keyword here is  new   Everyone thinks that acquiring new customers is the prime motive for a business  But it s not like that  Here are some facts about customer acquisition that might come as a surprise to many reading this post   Businesses have to spend approximately 500  more resources to acquire new customers than they do to keep the existing ones   More than 82  of all the companies agreed that retention of customers is cheaper to execute than their acquisition   This paints quite a clear picture of what s the smartest investment for a business owner to make  However  there is a whole creed of businesses which are too focussed on getting new customers that they tend to ignore the existing ones  And that s how they end up losing them  as a result of which profits start to decline  and it ultimately leads to huge loss in revenue   Now the question is   what can businesses do to avoid such circumstance  That s exactly what I am going to talk about in this post   So  let us begin   1  Get accurate numbers  There s no denying that you every business loses customers  But to create a strategy to retain them  you need to have the accurate numbers first  Track and analyse the impact they are having on your business  And then move to the task of planning how to tackle the problem   These numbers will help you to decide how much time and resources you need to invest to get things on the right track  Whether you need to bring in some new people to get with the retention strategies  or you can manage with the current team  All this can be decided only when you have accurate data about customers leaving you  for any reason   2  Focus on CLV  Customer Lifetime Value  rather than CTV  Customer Transaction Value   The names are quite self explanatory  The first one stands for the value a customer will provide during his entire lifecycle with your business  The second one is the value your business will get on acquiring a customer  CTV can be looked upon as a one time sale  whereas CLV can be looked upon as multiple selling opportunities  which is obviously going to more than CTV  And that ultimately means more profits   If your sales team is focusing on one time investment from the customer  then it needs to bring a change in the strategy  Like the facts mentioned earlier  it is more profitable to earn from an existing customer as compared to getting new ones to buy something   You need to start calculating the lifetime value that you can get from the customer  rather than just thinking it as a one time selling opportunity   3  Offer value  not just products  This can be looked as an extension to the point I ve mentioned above  Today s customers want to feel valued  As published in a recent report prepared for The American Express   66  customers are ready to pay up to 13  more to a company that delivers excellent customer service as compared to buying from the one that does not   So it won t be wrong to stay that you need to focus on making the customer feel the value they will get from your product or services  Because people are no longer inclined towards just low prices and big discounts  They are looking for the overall experience a product or a service has at offer for them   4  Be good  always  Offering a value in your product is simply not enough  You need to deliver on it as well  Today s competitive world requires businesses to do their best to retain customers  Because if they won t  someone else will  You cannot afford to sell a product saying something  and not delivering on it  Customers are smart enough to switch towards a better option as soon as they get even a slight hint of it   The solution here is to look beyond sales  It s as simple as that   Your marketing team can rope in customers by exclaiming great things about your product service  But to become a reliable brand you need to be good  always  From selling the product to handling complaints and solving their problems  And delivering on the promises you made while selling them  Everything is important   5  Build relationships  not customers  A good business is always about building relationships  Apple is a great example of a brand that does the same  They make customers feel privileged  This is why Apple has some of the most loyal customers  That s just one example  There are numerous others who are following the same footsteps   The bottom line here is to get the customer to return to your business  you need to build relationships  Let them know how much you value their business   Small gestures like a thank you mail to let the customer you value him choosing you over others can do wonders to get connected with the customer on a personal level  And that s best for your business   6  Never leave your customers alone  Leaving a customer alone means you are opening up space where someone else can step in  If a customer is using your product or service  you must leave no window of opportunity open for someone else to be his head  You must keep reminding him that your service is always there for him  whenever he needs   For instance  sending regular updates about what s new in your business  Updating them about any new cause that are getting connected with  Sending personal greetings on birthday  All these can work great   With all these things  the customer gets to know that you have not forgotten him  And no matter how big you have become  you still value your loyal customers   7  Keep innovating your product service  The most important aspect of customer retention is to let the customer know that you are not stagnating  Show them that you are still looking to go on from good to better and from better to best  The best way to do is to build a product service innovating   But  you can do it only by building a team that comes up with new ideas to better what s already existing  So  apart from all the external factors mentioned in the earlier points you need to make sure that your internal structure is solid   To sum the post here  I d like to come back to the point where we started   numbers  The game is still about numbers  The only difference is instead focusing just on adding more numbers of new users  We are talking about the importance of maintaining what you already have  along with adding more    Customer Retention written with chalk on tarmac over colorful graph and rising

that they didn t have enough time to build their product or they didn t learn how to tell a great brand story   But in the midst of all of those excuses  the real element that is lacking is customers  If you had customers knocking on your door to give you money for your product  all other problems would be solved  However  giving your project plenty of funding or devoting more time to it will not lead to more clients   It all boils down to customers  If you are able to build something that they love  your company will survive  with or without funding   Are you building your product blindly   Everyday  countless founders make the mistake of building their product blindly  They spend hours  weeks  months   or worse  years   making their perfect product  only to release it on the small chance that someone will want to buy it  This means that thousands of fully built products end up in the trash heap because their customers never really wanted them  Don t chance having your product end up in the dumpster   conduct some customer development so you can know that your customers want what you re making   Don t build you product blindly  Take the time to talk to your customers before building your product    How can you get started   Follow this guide until you have something that your customers love   Determine your Product   Value proposition  You have a business idea  If you didn t  you wouldn t be here  You may have already started building it  but if you re lucky  you haven t started yet   The first step into having your customers build your product for you is to create a simple value proposition for the direction that you want your business to go  This will put any potential customers that you talk to in the direction that you want them to go  At the end of the day  a happy medium for a successful startup is where what the founders want to build and what solves your customers  problem meet   The article   Useful Value Proposition Examples  And How to Create a Good One   by Peep Laja on ConversionXL provides a thorough explanation of what your value proposition is  In short  it is the way in which you present how your users will benefit from your product   Examples of possible top level value propositions for the Founder Institute would be   Learn How to Build a Lasting Company  Learn How to Start Your Company from Scratch  Make the Leap from Employee to Entrepreneur  Do you see how the same business can be built from these three ideas  If you look at our homepage  you will see that we chose the third option because that is the one that agrees most with our vision while resonating with our clients   When creating your value proposition  be sure to make it something that you think your customers will like or find useful   Construct a Landing Page   Collect emails  Once you ve established a value proposition  create a place that you can direct your customer to that will house it  Note that you could take your value proposition and directly contact customers to ask if it resonates with them  and get feedback from there  But for the sake of this guide  we will only go over how to put it onto a landing page and test different variations of it  This will also allow you to start building your very first audience through the form of an email list   Your page and value proposition don t have to be perfect and are likely to change  In fact  your entire product is likely to change  But it doesn t matter what we think  it matters what our customers think  This slideshow will help you set up your landing page  even if you don t have any coding skills  It also touches on the issue of split testing and how you can easily devise a split testing campaign  Split test two or three variations of your value proposition so that you can begin to identify trends in what your customers like and don t like   Find Where Your Customers Hang Out  Whether you decide to build a landing page or test your value proposition without it  you are still going to have to find the places where your customers spend their time  This may be a niche forum  an industry blog  or other similarly themed locations   Download our list of 12 places to find your customers  Study the source of customers so you can determine how they communicate and what they like  Here is an article   Do you speak your Customer s Language   by Monique De Maio recommends  employing tone  a voice  jargon  value propositions and marketing messages  that make sense to your customer   For instance  since the Founder Institute is in the startups niche  we know that our customers will likely be talking about  raising funding    building traction    finding a co founder   or other related subjects  We can now tailor many of our messages from this knowledge   Create Customer Conversations  There are many different ways to get valuable information from your potential customers  Below are two straightforward yet effective methods to acquire feedback on your offering   The Customer Interview  This article from Founder Institute mentor Justin Wilcox  titled  How I interview my customers   outlines the process that he uses to get the best information from his customers  In customer interviews  these are the questions that he employs   1  What s the hardest part about  problem context    2  Can you tell me about the last time that happened   3  Why was it hard   4  What  if anything  have you done to solve that problem   5  What don t you love about the solutions you ve tried   Justin posits that the hardest part of this exercise is filling out the problem context section   Emailing Your Potential Customers  While this is a more concise method  it will likely yield very limited responses  However  it may motivate you to actually take the plunge and talk to customers as talking directly to customers is often a more daunting task   An article by Gregory Ciotti on HelpScout  titled  The 7 Best Ways to Get Customer Feedback   outlines email and surveys as some of the best strategies to receive customer feedback  Although surveys are for more committed customers  email or messaging customers is the most direct way   For example  if you have found your potential customers on a forum in your niche  send them a message that directs them to your landing page to get feedback  A question like  what would it take to get you to sign up for this   can be an effective way to see if it piques their interest  If they like it  many of them will just go ahead and sign up through your email form   Fine Tune Your Value Proposition  These methods of getting customer feedback may seem like they are very time consuming tasks for a young startup  There are sure to be other more effective things that you could be doing  right   It is crucial to your business to get some initial feedback  Before paying for ads  market your landing page or invest time into building a product   This article on KISSmetrics   The Few Sentences You Need to Dominate Your Market   details several winning value propositions from a number of different companies and their quest to determing what their customers want   Once you ve gotten your intitial feedback  look for trends and tweak your value proposition based on this info  If you sample an adequate number of customers and 50  of them say that your value proposition is  boring  or  doesn t compel them to sign up   change it to something else until feedback improves and only 10  or less of your customers feel negatively about your offering  You are now on your way to improving your business and product   Ask Your Customer Advocates and New Customers  At this point  you should have considerable feedback from your initial customers  After you have begun to tweak your product  go back and talk to those customers again and show them your new page  You should have fixed some early problems that were pointed out  and should now be on your way to creating a winning value proposition and  hopefully  a winning product  However  don t abandon your search for feedback as you company will continue to evolve   This is round two of your customer feedback  If you have gone through the previous steps correctly  you will have something that is closer to what your target market is after  Continuously tweak and test your value proposition to make it even better and create something that your target market can t live without   Go Fast  Speaking to your customers going through the above process can seem like a slow and laborious process  But there is good news   You can now start paying for advertisements for your landing page and acquiring customers into your funnel much faster  Your conversion rates will be much higher because you ll actually be promoting the correct offer for your market and you ll be able to target certain pain points that you ve learned from your customers   One of the overlooked benefits of doing customer development before you build your product is that it actually makes your product development faster  Getting feedback like this will allow you to focus on building your core features that you know that your customers are going to like  You won t have to spend time  guessing  during the development process   Image from the book  Lean Customer Development  online version by Cindy Alvarez  In chapter one of the Lean Customer Development Book by Cindy Alvarez  she gives an example of how each hour you spend on customer development  saves you 5  10 or 20  hours of building your product  If you were to spend 10 hours on customer development it could easily save you 200  hours of work   Conclusion  Don t build your products blindly   Most founders are afraid to go and talk to their first customers  which causes them to spend way too much time being unsuccessful and less  or no  time being successful  Go through this process to avoid burnout with you and your team  and to build better products and your first audience   No matter what you go through the process to achieve primarily  it is an invaluable step for your business,"[888 1222 431 126 328 502 101 881 151 378 23]"
916,training-dataset/product/1287.txt,product,Finding the metrics that matter for your productStartup literature is full of ardent advice on how to measure activation  engagement and how users are interacting with your product   These concepts might help your business in the short term  but can leave you blinded by the very data you hoped would open your eyes in the long term   So how do you go from simply plugging your numbers into cookie cutter formulas to answering key questions about your product and business  And are you even asking the right questions in the first place   Not all products are the same  In the early days of the analytics team at Intercom  our tracking mostly consisted of typical SaaS company finance metrics  such as the conversion rate of our customers from trial to paid and Monthly Recurring Revenue  While these metrics are essential to understanding the overall health of a business and its strategy  they fall short for product teams because they don t answer all of the questions that are important to them  such as   Do customers find this feature valuable   or  How simple is our product to use    Without additional metrics focusing on user experience  the analytics team will have a diminished impact on the decisions the product team makes   Where most startups trip up is they don t know how to ask the right questions before they start measuring   We started by reading about what other companies had done  We found that a lot of the  best practice  advice on product metrics was useful for introducing concepts  but that the rules can t be uniformly applied  So much depends on the type of business you re running  A  99 B2B SaaS app will define engagement very differently to an eCommerce website   A key value of the analytics team at Intercom is  start with the right question   If we simply applied well worn frameworks blindly  we would be starting with someone else s question  not our own  And if the metrics these frameworks produce don t start with the right question  they don t influence how a product is built or the direction a business goes in  These metrics become false proxies that might look good on paper  but won t give you real insight on where to take the product next or what to improve upon    Most people use analytics the way a drunk uses a lamppost  for support rather than illumination     David Ogilvy  What s more  a single set of metrics to serve an entire company becomes less and less effective as the company grows in size  Teams tend to diverge in terms of the metrics they care about  Although they all may share a common high level mission  they contribute to the mission in different ways and so their success must be measured differently  The growth team are focused on engagement in one part of the product  the marketing team on an entirely different part   The right metrics start with the right questions  Where most startups trip up is they don t know how to ask the right questions before they start measuring  Doing this requires a collaborative partnership between analyst and product team  rather than a more traditional stakeholder resource relationship   To guide this partnership  we took inspiration from Google s HEART framework  which gives advice on defining metrics that follow from product goals  For example  here s a few questions we ask our product teams to help us understand their goals so that we can help them define meaningful metrics   If we imagine an ideal customer who is getting value from our product  what actions are they taking   What are the individual steps a user needs to take in our product in order to achieve a goal   Is this feature designed to solve a problem that all our users have  or just a subset of our users   To help our product partners answer these questions  we use product usage concepts that  over time  have become well understood and relied upon  These terms can be directly related to key points during a customer s journey within our product   Intent to use   The action or actions customers take that tell us definitively they intend to use the product or feature     The action or actions customers take that tell us definitively they intend to use the product or feature  Activation   The point at which a customer first derives real value from the product or feature     The point at which a customer first derives real value from the product or feature  Engagement  The extent to which a customer continues to gain value from the product or feature  how much  how often  over how long a period of time etc    Armed with these simple concepts  we can look to answer questions like the ones posed above  The next step is to look for signals that are specific to the product or feature which map to these concepts  We have found that open collaboration with people across our product teams   managers  designers  researchers and engineers   yields many useful signals that we can use to develop impactful product success metrics   As long as you re asking the right questions  you re going to get valuable insights that you can act upon  In short  start with the problem  not with the data   Developing your key metrics  Much like our philosophy of  ship to learn   defining product success metrics is just the beginning  To ensure their own success  they need to be advocated for  communicated  and even critiqued  Just like with the product they measure the success of  we must measure the success of the metric  Are the metrics giving us a true picture of product success  Are they influencing how we think about the product  Are they motivating the team who build the product  These are questions an analyst must constantly ask of the metrics they produce  advocate for and report on   This collaborative approach to metrics definition has led to a much more seamless relationship between analytics and product teams  Equally  using a common  consistent way of working means anyone in the organisation can easily understand any product metrics  what they mean and why they are important  This means changes to the product can be informed   or even led by   the insights gained from exploring the data framed by these metrics   A recent example of this is with our newest product  Educate  Our analytics and product teams partnered on this project from idea right through to launch  Metrics were decided upon at the start  using the simple  well understood questions first approach outlined above  This meant that early betas of the product already had a robust set of metrics in place so we could test our assumptions   For example  we hypothesised that it was important to understand how long it took a customer to get from actively creating articles  showing intent to use  to getting their customers  eyes on those articles  activating  efficiently  If customers could see the value from the product quickly  they would be more compelled to convert from a trial to a paying user   Beta customers  interactions with early versions of the product indicated it was taking customers a long time to reach this point  As a result  the product was simplified to allow for a more seamless experience  At launch we could see improved time to activation across the board  and this had a positive effect on overall conversion of customers from trial to paying   Join over 25 000 subscribers and get the best content on product management  marketing and customer support   We are keen to explore data informed design more  This is only the beginning  and we have many areas to improve  But starting with a partnership based approach has put us on a good trajectory towards becoming a truly data informed organisation,"[916 365 494 549 378 328 1253 642 126 23 431]"
950,training-dataset/product/796.txt,product,Turning amateur users into expertsThe question of what it takes to become an expert has occupied psychologists for decades   As user onboarding and customer success have become more important  it s pre occupied businesses too   So how do you get users to master your product  Most businesses try in one of the following ways   You can drag them kicking and screaming towards the finish line  Sure  you can successfully push people to do something in the short term  but the minute you stop  they stop  You can patiently hold their hand  and spoonfeed them the answers  Again  this works well in the short term  but because users are relying so much on autopilot  it s hard to get anyone past the  OK plateau   Or you can give people the tools they need to teach themselves  coupled with gentle prompts towards success   While options 1 and 2 might work for you in the short term  they still rely heavily on one to one interaction  Unless you plan on building a business around white glove onboarding  you re going to need to help customers become experts by themselves   Self service customer support tools like Intercom Educate will help with that  That means giving them the tools to succeed  with graduated hints and gentle prompts along the way  Here s a few ways you can do that   For every hunter  there will be a grazer  For every passionate user who will do everything they can to upskill on your product  you re going to have to try teach those who are little more reluctant  In educational theory they re referred to as  grazers   Unlike the hunter  they rely on being  fed  information to upskill them on a specific topic  Your product  for instance   That s where lifecycle emails come in  The trick is to craft your messages around key moments in the user s lifecycle  when somebody first signs up  when they use a feature for the first time  etc  and tailor each email accordingly  It s all about proactively teaching people how to be successful with your product  rather than hoping they stumble upon success themselves   Just look at this email Buffer sends to new users  Their browser extension makes it easier to share items you ve found while browsing  New users who fail to install the Buffer browser won t share as much  and therefore won t experience the full value of the product  All these little mini aha moments  learning a shortcut  uncovering a new feature  etc  are what motivates people to stick with something  or helps them retain more deeply what they ve learned already,"[950 1214 1282 1239 709 999 222 348 244 593 790]"
961,training-dataset/product/799.txt,product,Reimagining communication on the webReleased less than 2 weeks ago  Openvid is a recording tool that s changing the way teams communicate with each other  It has one simple purpose  Make recording and sharing videos as blazingly fast and simple as possible  There s no reason making a recording should take longer or be more of a pain than posting a status update to Facebook or shooting out a tweet   How did we get into video recording in the first place   6 months ago  we launched a platform that matched up product experts  UI UX designers  UI engineers  product managers  with startups  The screen  mic  and front facing cam video feedback generated on this platform was incredibly insightful  but we repeatedly heard that companies wanted to receive these recordings from their actual users  As a rule of thumb  there are 3 criteria to assess in the decision to build software   Market size and level of interest Technological feasibility Time it takes to create  We had preemptively validated the market  and after research into feasibility and time to build we determined it was a worthy effort  So we were off to the races   Make it simple  dummy  We were hopeful that people would be relieved to speak their feedback outloud versus heavy handed  free form surveys  To make that a reality we knew the user onboarding for recording a video had to be just as easy as surveys or they simply wouldn t go through the pain  There were a lot of ideas and prototypes  I mean a lot  With a lot of user research along the way   Here were some principles ingrained into us through this process   When possible  always keep users within the same experience  page  overlay  etc   Automate every step you can If you can t automate  simplify the options and action required  Put simply  don t make users think for themselves until they absolutely have to  The only way we could adhere to those principles was to build a Chrome extension that would take the user less than 15 seconds from opting in to actually recording feedback all within the same page   It s built  Come one  come all  Hello   There was a general perception that what we built was cool and useful  but when we talked to researchers and designers  the conversation was too abstract  We were having problems creating an emotional connection with the product  Without this emotional connection  there was no sense of urgency to begin gathering video feedback from their users  An emotional connection is only truly created when your product is situated in the context of your users  lives  The only way to do this was to was to instantly layer our recording experience on any site   Demonstrate value early and often  But that wasn t enough  We needed to instantly demonstrate the value of these video recordings by showing them to the user as soon as possible  With some clever engineering  the video we recorded as part of the demo was able to render within seconds  At that moment  lightbulbs turned on in our heads we knew we d landed on something big   Instant gratification over everything  More so than ever  instant gratification is critical to a product s success  Your product must deliver value whether artificial or real that activates a dopamine release in the person using it  This has to happen the first time they use your product  The later you delay this gratification  the more drop off you ll have   Fortunately  we had that in the videos rendering instantly  Unfortunately  this gratification hook didn t align well with receiving feedback it was much more powerful when providing feedback  Rarely do individuals want to immediately watch the feedback when it s recorded and does not deliver any additional value  So we started brainstorming use cases that could benefit from this lightning quick experience  and it began to click   Getting people to the same  aha  moment  Scott Belsky set the bar when he described how an onboarding experience should be to my cofounder and me   Even people who don t immediately recognize the value in recording videos should be able to record one anyways  because it is that simple    For us  it was a matter of running through the flow as many times as possible  We reapplied the lessons learned when onboarding users to give feedback to companies  People had to move from ideation of wanting to record to delivering the video in the fewest actions possible and with that we built the most stripped down version of our product   One click to record  One click to end the recording  Share the link we instantly generate with anyone  It could not get simpler than that   Come one  come all  For real this time  These videos have fundamentally changed the way our team communicates internally and externally  A few ways we ve heard it being used that would be relevant to the InVision audience   Giving high quality  in depth feedback on prototypes or mockups  Walk through client deliverables to drastically improve odds of satisfaction  More efficient and endearing responses to emails  Record design inspiration and thoughts associated to share with team  Being conscious of how we share our ideas can pay dividends  We instinctively communicate better by utilizing tonality  facial expressions  and gestures  We also interpret ideas in a different light when there are human layers enriching the words themselves   We sincerely hope it helps you and your team be more efficient and connected,"[961 502 431 222 608 1239 859 427 328 888 1026]"
970,training-dataset/product/1484.txt,product,Forget Products  Build Ecosystems    Manolis Babiolakis   MediumForget Products  Build Ecosystems  How products are transforming to open interconnectable interfaces   The most interesting thing I have heard from Mark Zuckerberg  during last April s F8  was his presentation on Facebook s product development process  According to Facebook s CEO  their approach starts by building a new technology that  can help people to share and connect   Then  they build this innovation into a product that offers value to one billion of users around the world  And when this product is mature enough  they build a full ecosystem of developers  businesses and partners around it   I think that what Zuckerberg described is not just Facebook s product development process  It is the evolution of innovation development and diffusion  It is what is happening today   From Platform to Ecosystem  Over the last decade or more  product design and development was dominated by the concept of platform innovation  enable the creation of more inventory without creating more stuff  More specifically  companies were creating value by enabling other companies to use their products or to build on their products  Google  Facebook  Apple  Amazon  AirBnB and most of the today s major tech companies  growth was based on this approach   However  a new era has already arisen   The main idea around platforms is to enable third parties to use an infrastructure that you have developed  providing it as a medium for value distribution  However  that creates obvious limitations  What if a radically good idea cannot be supported by the provisions of any existing platform  like Android or iOS  And what if the general idea of platforms set limitations to both parties  platform provider and product developer  to create a solution that can cover people needs   The solution is to reduce those limitations   Do not build products  Do not build platforms  Build ecosystems   Building Ecosystems  The core idea around ecosystems is interconnection  The elements of an ecosystem are interconnected in a vital form for their growth  Every part of the ecosystem increases its chances to survive through its connection to the ecosystem  At the same time  the possibility of the ecosystem to survive increases by the number of the living organisms that are connected to it   Something similar is happening with products  nowadays  Products are evolving to ecosystems  More precisely  products are evolving to hubs of value that other products can connect with  in a vital for their growth way   Think about Slack  the trending business communication and productivity app that has been described as  the fastest growing business app ever   Slack was launched in August 2013  After their initial tremendous success  Slack s team decided to launch their  Platform  in order to enable developers to create products in Slack s platform  However  the classic form of a platform would decrease the possibilities of this opening  And thus  Slack has not limited this opening to a traditional form of platform  They created an ecosystem   By now  everyone knows Slack s Apps  As a user of Slack  you can integrate Google Analytics and receive insights for your website  store or retrieve data from your Google Drive account  manage your project with Howdy  receive directly your brand s word of mouth through Mentions  integration  and even communicate directly with your customers through the integration of your customer s support tool   Similar to Slack  products are evolving to open interconnectable interfaces  which enable other products to integrate with them  in order to provide their value to people   What is the value   Ecosystem is about enabling companies to offer the value of their core product through the integration with your product  More precisely  it is to enable other products to use your product interface as a medium to provide their already created and constantly improving value  Companies committed to the provision of a specific solution for people s needs do it through your product  And these are the two significant values for you   Firstly  your product s value increases without your team s effort  Users are enabled to use more features that you have not committed sources and effort to develop  to maintain  to promote and to constantly improve  Every time that your team decides to commit to the creation of an additional feature that differentiates from your product s core value  you take a significant risk  However  companies used to take this risk in the past  due to the expected reward   Through the ecosystem logic  value creation and value provision are separated   Let s consider the example of Trello  one of the most trending task management tools  those days  Trello has become part of the project management function of every size company and team  Trello s simplistic logic provides a solution to organize and prioritize tasks with minimum effort  However  it was not providing one of the most important tools of every project manager  Gantt Charts  A solution would be to commit a team to build this feature  The alternative was to provide the opportunity to a team out of the company to build this feature  And Trello did exactly that  with Elegantt   Secondly  you increase the possibilities  as Nir Eyal would put it  to turn your product into a powerful habit  By enabling other products to provide their value though your user interface  you increase the things that users can execute directly through your product  This means that users are being educated to do more things though your User Interface and Experience  spending more time with your product  providing you data that will enable you to improve the core value of your product and turn this product to a significant part of their routine  And that is exactly what products needs in order to thrive   Slack  by enabling so many products to integrate with its core user experience  provides functionalities that otherwise should be built by its team  That increases significantly the value of Slack for its users  They are able to do so many things that otherwise they would need to login to other products in order to access them  But they do not need to  They can read analytics reports  answer to customers requests  or even call an Uber  by using the same interface and by getting used to the logic of Slack s commands in order to do everything  Namely  by forming the strong habit of using Slack    and to connect or not to connect    But what is the value for someone who decides to develop a Slack app or a Trello power up    This is the automatic question that I received from everyone that I described him her the ecosystem concept  I strongly believe that companies could gain significant value by integrating with other products   Firstly  it is a brilliant go to market strategy  Think about a startup that would like to build a new customer support software solution  Normally  it would require to design an interface and to build a minimum reasonable user experience  After that  it would require to spent marketing efforts in order to raise awareness of potential customers and to persuade them to try the product  The required effort and cost could postpone the launch of the product  However  by deciding to create a Slack app  this founding team can only focus on the development of the core capabilities and launch months or even years earlier   Secondly  it enables to provide a core value through user s favorite interface  More precisely  every interface  It is a clear fact that people would like to minimize the time they spend during their working day and everyday life  It is really reasonable that for various really valuable products  they would prefer to stay in the same environment that they use already for so many other things  In the integration era  you can enable them to use the interface they prefer   For example  Elegantt team launched initially a Trello power up but it is now planning to build integrations for several other popular products such as Asana and Basecamp   In summary   The idea of product ecosystems describes the value that the interconnection of products provides to both companies and users  It impacts significantly the innovation development and diffusion process and provides unlimited opportunities for new value creation  Product people and startupers can achieve outstanding growth by making the ecosystemic evolution as a priority for their roadmaps   You just need to do one simple thing  Forget old products  Build ecosystems,"[970 410 174 57 427 544 1142 244 126 1253 151]"
999,training-dataset/product/779.txt,product,5 delightful ways to onboard new usersThere s always that moment during or after development when  inevitably  customer feedback suggests that users can t figure out how to use your product  or features have grown so deep and complex that people are scared away before giving things a chance   After the ruckus of designer I told you so s and tiresome finger pointing between the product manager and developer subsides  the distress of supporting a very useful product that might not even get used really begins to settle in   But there s a solution  Onboarding is a mechanism for first impressions  which can shape the way users perceive your product from the first time they sign up  to the day they re converted to a paid account   Your users are entering into a relationship with your product  so onboarding should be looked at as a chain of ongoing first impressions  Depending on your intended goals  different onboarding techniques can be employed to effectively hook  instruct  and retain users  And keep them happy   So before you scour Dribbble s seemingly endless collection of instructional swipe throughs  or copy your favorite app s awful Pop Up Video style tooltips on every UI control on the screen  please don t do this   pause and give some thought to what you re trying to accomplish and which technique is most appropriate   So wait  there are multiple kinds of onboarding   Absolutely  The term onboarding has become a bit of a catch all term for generic user education  but as characterized earlier  it might be more appropriately deemed a first impression to introduce users to anything that is new and or unknown   Let s start with the most common method   1  The Window Shopper  Method  Users quickly skim primary features  Appropriate for  Well known domains and common features  Benefits  Establish or persist a visual style and brand voice  bite sized info  Limitations  Limited opportunity for detailed instruction  people don t read  The simplest to comprehend and the most developer friendly  this method manifests itself in a series of swipe able screens  usually with illustrations and accompanying help text to describe the primary features of an application   Though most common  this method is often misused in places where more interactive onboarding would be more suitable  This is most appropriate for applications with common interaction patterns that require little to no explanation  Avoid this method if you are introducing a new way of thinking   2  The New Concept  Methods  2   Training wheels   best practices  both explained below   Appropriate for  Proposing a new way of thinking  a new mental model   Benefits  Users can learn at their own pace  Limitations  Best practices are not always applicable  You can t start a fire without kindling  and you can t introduce a hot new idea without warming users up to it first   The New Concept is one of the more intricate onboarding methods because it s a balancing act of just enough  but not too much  New idea onboarding can be broken into 2 sub types  Training wheels and best practices   Training wheels  Bike training wheels keep you safe when you re learning to ride  Since you re still figuring out your balance and trying your best not to kiss asphalt  training wheels allow you to focus on pedaling and steering instead of fighting your wobbly center of gravity   In the same way  the training wheels method assists and supports the user while he she concentrates on completing one or 2 simple tasks   Example  A task management app  Training wheels   Try creating a task and assigning it to a user  Don t worry  we already created one for you  Her name is Anne    In the example above  there are several required steps during task creation  one of which involves assigning the task to a user  Since we are teaching task creation and not user creation  2 entirely different workflows   we relieve the user of the latter  allowing them to give 100  focus to the  literal  task at hand   Related  5 key lessons for successful user onboarding  Sigstr puts training wheels in their interactive onboarding to introduce users to their new email signature concept  Users have complete artistic control over their signature and campaign inside of the product  but Sigstr steers them away from the rich customizer to make sure users understand this new concept instead   Best practices  Every designer  product manager  and developer knows that there are 2 constants in the world of product   Users will do whatever the heck they want  and   it s rarely the way you intended it to be used in the first place  The makers of Q tip cotton swabs know this all too well  It literally says on the box  Hey guys  don t put these in your ears   And what do people do  they dig at their ears like they re prospecting for gold   If users don t know otherwise  they ll make their best guess at how to use your product and they ll usually assume that they re right   If your product offers newer  better ways to do something  make sure you let users know that   Emailing yourself reminders is pretty common  Pick up milk  charge my camera batteries  renew my driver s license   Google Inbox has a built in feature called Reminders  but since it s a new concept from the way users are used to doing things  they inject a best practice tip directly in the flow when it detects a user trying to send him herself an email   Note  This method of onboarding doesn t even occur when the user first downloads the app  It s an added first impression Google makes to steer users toward a product feature at the exact moment when it is most appropriate   3  The First Date  Method  Collect basic user profile and account information  Appropriate for  When apps need a lot of information to get started  Benefits  Apps feel more tailored to me when I first get started  Limitations  Users may be uncomfortable giving up personal information  Every first date conversation covers a checklist of common topics  occupation  family  hobbies  growing up  location  etc   But no one wants a first date to feel like a job interview  This is love  after all not a summer internship   Likewise  there are organic ways to collect information from a user without pages of form fields  We want a second date  right   Example techniques  Social signup  You can get a lot of information about a user from their social profile  name  photo  email  location  company  job title  Remember to use the most appropriate social profile for your app  If your product is business related  you should probably use LinkedIn instead of Facebook or Twitter   Mad Lib  Structure your form semantically to form a sentence  Users will see exactly how much info is required  and the  form  will feel faster  Do not use this method for more than 3 or 4 pieces of information   Give  then take  Give the user some immediate value before asking for information  Users will feel more invested in your product  and be more willing to give up personal details when prompted  Thumbtack helps you find service providers and receive quotes  and does an exceptional job letting users create an entire job request before ever asking for an email address   4  The Imitation Game  Method  Teach users through instruction and exercises  Appropriate for  Teaching hidden interactions  seeding the app with data  Benefits  It s fun  users learn by doing  immediate user value and investment  Limitations  Harder to implement than traditional  window shopping   This onboarding method is similar to The Window Shopper  but is interactive instead ofpassive  This model is effective because a feature can be explained and experienced at the same time  In one fell swoop  users learn WHAT the feature is  WHY they re doing it  and HOW to do it   Apple uses the imitation method in their onboarding for Apple Music   Users are brought to a screen where they re instructed to select genres of music they like to help the app make intelligent music recommendations  There are 3 supported interactions  a single tap  a double tap  and a long press   Users can practice these gestures right on the screen  all the while Apple is collecting details about their music preferences   5  The Upsell  Method  Provide immediate value  then hint at more  Appropriate for  Upgrading users to additional features and or paid accounts  Benefits  Well  money  Limitations  User expectations jump tremendously once they re paying  As a reminder  onboarding is  a first impression used to introduce users to anything that is new and or unknown    The Upsell is arguably the most important responsibility outside of creating a product of functional value   Proving to users that the grass is indeed greener on the other side of the paywall is tricky  because they have to believe that it s not just AstroTurf   Example techniques  Feature blocking  This method involves putting a barrier between users and additional paid content   Caution  Be careful with this method  because it can be a real turnoff  You want users to be delighted to sign up  not cursing under their breath   SEMrush uses feature blocking to entice users to upgrade to a pro account  Instead of completely barring users from this page  they show 10 results for free  and hide the rest  They demonstrate the value of their premium features  and leave users wanting more  You wouldn t buy a new car without test driving it first once users are behind the wheel  they won t want to give up the keys   Paid convenience  If there are multiple ways for users to do something in your app  you have tremendous upsell opportunity  Speaking from personal experience  users can be pretty lazy  and if I can pay a little more money to save a little more time  my bank account is all yours   Marketing copy is critical in paid convenience  and it s not a bad idea to be a little self deprecating to point out when things aren t ideal   Example  A task management app  Paid Convenience   Looks like you re copying tasks by hand  that s rough  Upgrade to a premium account to quickly duplicate multiple tasks at once    Adam Becker uses paid convenience to upsell and onboard users to premium features like custom colors  fonts  and more  Knowing the limitations of the free design editor  he puts customization behind a paywall  It s a minor convenience that he knows people will pay for   3 things you shouldn t do during onboarding  1  Smother the user  Don t use the first sign on to spout everything your app does  Information is out of context  users won t remember anyway  and you re literally blocking them from doing exactly what you want them to do  use your product  Onboarding is a series of first impressions  not just one  Use them   2  User Pop Up Video tooltips  You ve seen them before  A black curtain with spotlights over key interface components  or annoying tooltips that barge in like Microsoft s Clippy introducing you to ever single button  list  and pixel on the screen  Your product ought to be designed well enough to drive experimentation and self guided discovery in the first place  but if you must  the user should have an escape route from the guided tour   3  Design onboarding without sales and marketing  Your product is the direct line of communication between you and your users  That means every onboarding screen  every line of help text  and every empty page is a chance to impress or disappoint them  That s a lot of pressure  Luckily  there are brilliant teams of people in marketing and sales who are experts at communicating business and product value  Don t just let them help  ask them to   Respect onboarding  After 3 hours preparing a meal  you wouldn t slop it onto a paper plate and act surprised when people don t buy it  Don t make onboarding an afterthought  When you do  it comes through to the user and ultimately shows a lack of customer support   It may not be the first thing you design  but onboarding can be the final step that brings product development and marketing together to turn your product into a gift to the user,"[999 1282 1214 244 1239 709 222 348 1253 427 431]"

1009,training-dataset/business/78.txt,business,Picking your pricing modelSticking a  5 month price tag on your product might lead you to believe it is affordable for everyone  Far from it   Low pricing rules out lots of potential customers  in the same way serving  3 steaks in a restaurant actually restricts your clientele   Whether it s a SaaS app or a restaurant  you first understand what it takes to attract your target customer  and decide how much revenue you want to earn from them  Plotting these two decisions gives you three options   A complex sales process for low value customers is never a viable business  no matter how many start ups try it  It s like selling  2 hot dogs in a world class high maintenance dining room  The numbers won t add up  As we ve covered before  low pricing alone isn t disruptive  it s just cheap  Your competitive advantage has to scale as you move upmarket   Joel York coined the above axes to define the three key sales models for SaaS businesses  Many start ups drop themselves in the lower left quadrant  often without understanding exactly what decisions they ve made  Here s some companies you ll find in each quadrant   Which Quadrant you Choose  Going for the lower left means you usually end up with a high amount of low value customers  This limits how you can acquire customers  Dropbox  for example  learned the hard way that they could never afford to acquire customers by advertising  Low pricing also limits how much support you can offer  Woothemes learned they can t afford to support certain customers  The trade offs are numerous   None of these trade offs are inherently bad  but they must be conscious decisions based on your strategy  Depending on the industry  customer type  and addressable market at your disposal  picking the wrong quadrant can leave you dead before you get started  Three examples   Some industries are notoriously hard to reach  e g  content marketing isn t as effective on dentists as it is on developers  This means you might need to pay to acquire customers   Some industries deal in annual contracts  NDAs  and SLAs  This means you need to invest in a sales process   Some industries are used to Powerpoint sales presentations  handheld on boarding  and onsite training  This means you need a high contract value to profit on a customer   Picking More Than One  It s common for companies to have two different pricing models to address two ends of the market  Github  for example  compete at the  7 month price point  but also sell Enterprise Github at  1K per month to big companies  To service the high end Github employ a VP of Sales  sales managers  account managers  and account executives   Transactional pricing lets start ups go upmarket without having to change their product or business model  By ensuring there s no limit in how much your customers can pay  transactional pricing avoids the common pitfall of price plans  Making your top plan  unlimited  ironically places a hard limit on how much you ll ever earn from a customer  As Joel Spolsky points out  unlimited plans give an amazing discount to your least price sensitive customers  who need it the least  and will barely appreciate it  It s easy to add an unlimited plan without thinking this through  and once offered  it s very hard to take it back   One advantage of sticking with a set of price plans is that you re never beholden to any one customer  as Jason Fried notes  but once again this should be a conscious decision you make  not the result of an unquestioned default   As with all matters of pricing  there s no  one true way   but there are lots of wrong turns and dead ends  Avoid those and you re in good shape   Read more  4 pricing principles to never forget,"[1009 1231 367 155 1268 703 459 1202 1332 524 756]"
1014,training-dataset/product/588.txt,product,Does your support team know more about your product than you do Your support team spends all day talking to customers about your product  That probably means they know both your product and your customers pretty well  But how well do you know them  At the Austin leg of our Inside Intercom World Tour  I discussed how you can leverage your customer support team to improve your product  Prefer reading to watching  You ll find a written version of my talk below  I m a customer support lead at Intercom  which means that my team and I sit in between  our customers and our product team  Our product team is incredible   we are a product first company and we have a really high bar   but sometimes less than perfect things get shipped     That makes our customers sad  which makes our customer support team sad  which makes our product team sad  If you re growing as fast as Intercom is growing  you have a lot of people shipping a lot of things to a lot of customers  and that creates potential for a lot of sad people  However  there are simple ways a customer support team can work with the product team to keep everybody happy  The outsourcing silo When I started at Intercom in 2014 I was the fourth person on the customer support team  Since then  we ve grown to 55 people globally  handling 22 000 conversations every month  We re a pretty big team supporting a lot of customers and having a ton of conversations  When you re scaling a support team that quickly there is the temptation to treat customer support as something you just have to deal with  That can cause companies to outsource their support  sometimes to the other side of the world  But even if you have a customer support team right within your company  if you don t talk to them  that s kind of the same thing as outsourcing  What outsourcing does is give customers replies  We re not saying they re good replies  or friendly replies  or on brand replies  or maybe even correct replies  They re simply getting replies  What gets measured gets done  so if all you care about is the median first response time  then that s a good case for outsourcing  However  if you re not talking to your support team about how your customers feel about what you re shipping  your product team is numb to the frustration that your customers are facing  Right place  right time feedback If you re not looking at the conversations your customer support team is having with customers  you re basically throwing information away  You might say   It s fine  I have a really good research team  They talk to my customers  I know exactly what s going on   That could be true  But imagine you owned a restaurant  and a few days after somebody ate there you sent them an email asking them what they thought of the new soup they ate  That feedback is going to be very different to feedback from somebody who was eating at your restaurant and tapped a waiter on the shoulder to tell them the soup is a little salty  This is an extreme example  but it highlights the difference between  survey feedback  and  unsolicited feedback    Survey feedback is what your research team is getting  It s important  but it s context free and it s a closed conversation  You re also asking about things that you know you want more information on  Whereas if you look at the conversations customer support is having with your customers  there s tons of unsolicited feedback  It s workflow driven  it s an open conversation and it s hitting those blind spots you wouldn t know to ask about  Using customer support to solve product problems When you think about customer support  think about it like recycling   you re getting two uses out of the same thing  Most customer support only looks to solve the customer problem  and that s when you end up with things like docs and autoresponders  But if you don t solve the product problem it s worse than you think  If your product team isn t getting feedback on what they re shipping  they re probably going to ship more things that your customers and maybe even the market doesn t want  They re getting worse and so is your product  That s bad  Once you start talking to your support team and find out what they re talking to your customers about  you can make all that data actionable for your product team  The value of tagging One of the most important things we do at Intercom is tag every single conversation that comes into our inbox with both a team tag and a category tag  The team tag denotes what product team owns that feature or part of the product  while the category tag describes what type of conversation we had  Using these tags  our product team can create dashboards  look at unusual spikes  consistent trends  explore conversations and get insights into what we should be working on next  Here are some examples of how we have used tags to improve our product  1  Building better onboarding Within our onboarding flow  we had noticed a consistently high volume of conversations tagged  product confusion   When you first install Intercom  you have to do two things  install a little piece of JavaScript into your site and sign up for one of our paid products  If you did both of those things you d see the Messenger on your site and you d be all set  If you only did one of those things you would see nothing  Customers were writing in because they were sure they had done the JavaScript correctly  but couldn t get the Messenger to appear  We identified the issue and created a project aimed at addressing it  Now  if somebody installs Intercom and they ve done both of those things correctly  they will see a little pop up telling them exactly that  saying   You re all set to go and you can start playing around with Intercom   If they only do one of those things correctly  they will see something that says   Hey  you got the JavaScript set  but you need to go back into the Intercom UI and sign up for a trial of one of our products,"[1014 328 1247 756 1026 502 1415 384 1058 32 709]"

communicate in an authentic way  When I started at the company  there were six people  and now we re pushing 70 80  We re doing more initiatives within the company now  of course with more people  but really it s the same core  We re talking all the time about how businesses are using video and how we think they should be using video in the future  Jeff G  That idea of hardworking video is really important  The ability for content creators to link their videos through and really have a lot of data behind what they re doing  that s pretty unique for businesses  I don t think they ve had a lot of that in the past  Jeff V  The idea is to take control of your content  so we do have some customers that use YouTube  but maybe they push them to a page on their website that  as an example  has some more premium content  Then they re diving into the analytics that we provide to understand where people are tuning in  where they are dropping out  what kind of tools they could overlay within the video content to get more signups  etc  Keeping product and support in sync    A product team cut off from feedback will repeat its mistakes  but an isolated support team will become apologists

how do we support them  What the heck should we be doing  Their emails are going directly to the CEO  and we don t know what to do  My time in that support leadership role was about growing a team and setting up processes so we could take care of our customers the way that we thought that we should  We grew that team from  well  zero people when I started  to up to 12 people when I ended up changing roles  That team was going to continue to scale  so we needed a really good people focused manager  That was Aaron Wheeler  He came from Moz  replaced me in that role  and has just been incredible  It happened to be perfect timing  We didn t have a product team  Brendan Schwartz  who was a co founder and CTO had been building the original product  and he had a few engineers  plus our head of product design  Jo  They were working through priorities  roadmaps  etc  But they saw opportunities to take on bigger challenges  to strike a better balance between working on customer facing issues and features  and also the backend work  Striking a balance between the two of those and really growing the team   adding user research  design  product management   they asked me if I would take on that role and figure out how we could grow the team  That was really exciting  Those two things just happened to me overnight  and it s been a really fun challenge  Jeff G  You re not the first person I ve met who s made this pretty similar career transition from a customer facing role into a more product focused one  Do you think this might be a more common career trajectory for the future  Jeff V  When people ask me about whether they should be looking to make that transition  I definitely recommend it  For me  I care really deeply about the customer experience  I care more about the customer experience than pretty much anything else  In a support role  you re interfacing directly with the customer  but very often the root of the problem is in product  Following those problems upstream  I was always very involved  especially when we had a really small team and no product team  I was very involved in product and how we updated the product to support that better customer experience  The transition meant I had a bigger impact on a larger percentage of the customer base  We have lots of people who use us every day  but only a very small percent who end up interacting with us in support  The thing from a personality standpoint that I would probably ask people to think about is sure  the impact that you can have on the product side can be bigger  but the spacing is much bigger  I may not have a big impact on the customer experience for a month or two  until we ship something  I don t get recognized and the team doesn t get recognized for the work that they do as much  as opposed to those people who get addicted to that good morphine drip of  I respond to a support request and someone says   Hey  thanks  Jeff  That s awesome  That totally solved my problem   Jeff G  It s the gratification  Jeff V  That s the balance that people need to figure out  Scaling a support team from zero Jeff G  There s a lot of early stage companies that listen to this podcast and I m sure a lot of them are trying to grow a support team from zero to X  How did you decide how to structure the team  What were the kind of things that influenced that decision  Jeff V  Yeah  This is such a good one  Such a tricky one too  We can talk contact info later  but I definitely would encourage people to reach out because so much of this can be conditional  When I left the support team  we had two separate teams between four and six on each  and we had team leads for both  We had people who would come up through support and who clearly had people management skills  They were better managers than I was  They probably just didn t have that experience and that cross company vision  and so their first step was being elevated to team leads and taking on the hard work of keeping people really engaged  We wanted to do a better job of having consistent conversations with each of our teammates  That s when you identify the issues that otherwise could lead to burnout  At that time  customer happiness was really support and education  One part was answering tickets in the inbox and the other was thinking about more proactive or scalable education in the form of documentation or in app messaging  Nowadays customer happiness is support  it s customer success  it s education and then it s some of the transactional stuff like  how you do billing  The volume  at the time when I left  was about 200 to 300 conversations per day  I think we ve just about doubled since then   Jeff G  Wow  not an insignificant amount of incoming requests then  I ve heard you say previously that there are four key points that really help create successful customers  Trust  confidence  consistency and authenticity  I m particularly curious about that last one  I ve heard you previously describe authenticity as being more human as a business  and that it s a key component of the mission at Wistia  How did you come to that as an essential ingredient of your customer and or product strategy  Jeff V  The overarching belief for us there is that when people come to work  they should be able to be their true selves  and that if we were able to hire people and build a culture that consistently valued people being their real  weird selves  we were going to get far more out of each employee   and they were going to be far happier in the work that they were doing  That s all about authenticity  Authenticity works perfectly with support because you want to be really honest with the customer  What you need to figure out is what information you should be sharing and what information you shouldn t  and so we try to have conversations all the time about that  In terms of creating an experience  we re not perfect and no software platform that serves a large number of customers is perfect  Whether it s a bug or say we pass along some information that ends up being wrong  we end up getting a pass because we re able to follow up and be human  so the customer doesn t think about us as a corporation  You get mad at Microsoft  You get mad at Uber  You get mad at these faceless organizations  When the customer knows you as a person  when they can say honestly   I know that Jeff and Brendan and Chris and Chris and all those people over at Wistia are working hard on this problem   they tend to relate to it a little bit differently  They see their own imperfections as well  That piece is incredibly important  It s why in our history we ve never lost a support person because of burnout  We ve lost them because they graduated on to a better role  Jeff G  In terms of really being about the individuals involved  do you think it s impossible to keep that authenticity as you become a very large company  Jeff V  No  I don t  That s what video is really great for  Our team continues to put themselves out there  We send videos directly to the customer from the rep that they re working with  or we send videos out around things like   Hey  we re taking a break for the holiday  but we love serving you   We do that for weekends as well so when people reach out and we don t provide support  we ll follow up with an email that shows off some of those support faces  It has to pervade the entire company so you re authentic within  but it s also about the way you communicate with the customer  Our web page still has a single person s face on it  It happens to be mine  They should A B test that because I bet you mine is bad for business  We continue to put a face out there  and that sets up that relationship for success  Automate where possible but be human where you can Jeff G  Contradict me if I m incorrect here  but I heard you speak at a conference a few years ago  and one of the points you made was that you actively work to keep customers from becoming dependent on the support team  This probably speaks to that education stuff we were talking about before  You guys make it just a little bit harder for people to get in touch  Your contact link is put into the knowledge base or help documentation on your site  What s the thinking there  Are you betting that educating customers is a better way to make sure that they re not dependent on you  Jeff V  I don t think you re wrong at all  The only detail there that I want to make sure we get right is that customers can contact us within their accounts and we try to make that obvious  although we haven t gone so far as to use a widget the way that Intercom does  that prompts the conversation  I still very much believe that for support you should be trying to automate where you can and then be really intensely human where you can  If you think about it from the customer s perspective  we re seeing this trend that customers want a resolution to the problem   they don t necessarily want to talk to somebody in all cases  What s most important is that the problem gets fixed  When we were having a lot of our support be extremely technical  or something that was really hard to keep up with in chat  where it takes time to figure out what to do  that was really hard  That would be hard with a high volume  For us  we thought about how to get people the answers they needed faster without necessarily having to bury it in a queue of emails that we then have to work through  That led us to invest very heavily in our documentation  in our education resources  We want to put those out there  It s not necessarily as a barrier  It s because we think they re really great and we want people to make use of those  I certainly agree with what you said around training the customer to solve their own problem because we don t provide 24 7 support right now  A lot of small business owners that I ve spoken with  marketing managers  they re doing this in their extra time  You re busy 9 to 5  You go home and you put kids to bed or whatever  and then maybe you go back and you do a few more hours of work  One of those things they may be trying to do  and I m stealing this entire concept from a talk by Jeff Lawson from Twilio  is just solve their problem when it s 9 30 and there s nobody in the office  It all means investing heavily in your education resources and really putting pressure on the product to work right  not just to rely on the person  How the customer voice informs the product roadmap,"[1026 328 1247 1014 32 756 222 384 1058 709

1036,training-dataset/business/408.txt,business,Why Founders Fail To Market Their Products   Never Give UpWhy Founders Fail To Market Their Products  Founders predictably underestimate the importance of hiring marketers  As a result  many startups don t get round to marketing their product until it s too late  This happened to me and I ve thought long and hard about why this happens   The builder s dream  As CEO of my last company  I was on a mission to build an outstanding product  I wanted it to be like something fresh out of Apple   simple and elegant  with every detail looked after  I dreamt of users talking about it with their friends  writing in to thank us for improving their life   So I set about building the product right  I read everything I could about product management  I spent hundreds of hours interviewing customers to understand their motivations  pain points  and routines  I prototyped throughout our agile development lifecycle  And I measured acquisition funnels  user activation goals  retention cohorts  and user journeys to understand how the product performed   Finally  my dream came true  Our app was stickier than any other in its category  Users wrote in telling us how much they loved our app  And they even recommended it to their friends  There was just one tiny problem   User growth was still too slow   We never got to Series A and  eventually  the money ran out   Builder s remorse  Growth is a big deal in early stage tech  Surprisingly  when I ask founders whether they ve hired a marketer  all too often the answer is  not yet   It s so much easier to spot your own mistakes when you see other people making them  that was my answer for over a year  It was a massive mistake   Worse still  I think I knew it was a mistake at the time but I didn t fix it  And so  here is why I never hired a marketer  I hope it inspires other founders to make marketing an early priority and avoid the typical fate of most startups   Myth 1  Marketing is cheating  I believed that if you had a great product  it would market itself  It would be awesome if that was true  But it s not   Great products deserve great marketing   Tweet this  Vincent Dignam  a London based growth hacker  says  the first rule about growth hacking is do not talk about growth hacking    Successful companies have every reason to hide what actually drives their growth  In response to how you grow  they are better off saying  we just focus on building awesome products for our users   This is the lie we all buy into  Not anymore   Myth 2  Marketing starts after launch  How much can a marketer achieve before having a product to market  To me  it sounded inefficient  even futile  Looking back  the list of critical activities that were unnecessarily postponed makes me cringe   Like creating and promoting content for future customers  capturing leads in a mailing list  keeping leads warm with a newsletter  building an online following  forming distribution partnerships  building relationships with influencers  speaking at events  setting up an evangelist program  and testing communications on different segments    Marketing Development  activities don t require a product to be launched at all   Tweet this  If only I d known sooner   Myth 3  Most marketers don t get it  During the first year  I interviewed dozens of marketers  I got them to draft a marketing plan for my company and walk me through it  I was waiting for someone to tell me how to generate a huge amount of high quality traffic to the landing page  for free  almost immediately   But no one offered me a silver bullet  And I never made an offer   Most of the marketing plans looked boring  One marketer told me that  a brand isn t created overnight   it takes many months of messaging to build a reputation   Many months  I want growth NOW  I don t have funding for  many months   There must be a hack   There is a hack  but it s not what most founders think  Hire a marketer months before product launch to begin marketing development activities early   Tweet this   Myth 4  Marketing too soon is deadly  What if users signed up early and the product was delayed  What if they came to the website and it crashed  What if everyone in the world laughed at me and said  Dave  you quit your  150 000 job to build that piece of shit    I never said any of this out loud  But this fear of rejection conflicts with the confidence needed to invest in marketing  The confidence that it s not about me or my product  it s about helping customers achieve their goals  The confidence that my message is worth spreading early   Myth 5  Hiring a marketer takes too much time  Have you ever tried to clarify what a product does to a founder  only to hear  well  that s part of it  but it can do so much more    I used to believe that communicating a product effectively required an exhaustive knowledge of the product and business model  Only I know everything about my company so it would demand a lot of time to transfer this knowledge to someone else   This is a flawed assumption  Someone with less understanding of how a product actually works is often better equipped to communicate what it does than someone stuck in the weeds   What happened next  After parking the venture  I spent a couple of weeks writing out everything I learned from the experience  I challenged myself to promote each essay as best I could to maximise their impact for other founders   After countless hours of marketing each essay  I realise that growth marketing is a process  not a magic bullet   Every day  I keep looking for new partner publications that can take my idea to a large  relevant audience  I keep working out ways to test which title is most effective  I keep making it easier to tweet  favourite  and share each piece  I keep promoting essays in relevant online communities  I build up my mailing list every day  And I keep engaging the right people on social media   The list of ways to get traction never ends  Just as you think you ve figured it out  something changes  or you come up with a new idea   A personal message to founders everywhere  Someone needs to be doing marketing activities at your startup from day 1  Not after launch  Not during some PR campaign  Every day  Building a great product is hard  Great marketing is hard too  And you absolutely need both in order to win   It takes smarts  endless persistence  a knack for communicating things  an ability to close partnerships  and of course  a product that adds value  And like product development and customer development  marketing development takes longer than you think  Hire the smartest people you know because you need all the help you can get,"[1036 365 494 549 13 23 442 80 888 1134 151]"
1043,training-dataset/business/1491.txt,business,The  1 2M Churn and Burn to Learn MistakeDo you need to churn and burn customers to learn  A lot of people in startups think so  In fact  a lot of people in companies of all shapes and sizes think so   Think you need to churn and burn through thousands of customers before it starts to have a negative impact on your growth velocity and costs  I ll show you why that s just not true   If you think churning and burning customers so you can learn is the way to go  sit back and let me tell you a fun little story about an expensive lesson that didn t need to be learned   In fact  what I ll share is why startups need to build in Customer Success from the ground up  and established companies need to bring Customer Success into their universe ASAP   First  I have to acknowledge what Steve Blank famously said   Your startup is essentially an organization built to search for a repeatable and scalable business model    This means it s totally accurate to say that  at first  you don t know what you don t know   The problem is that some people use that startup definition as an excuse  a crutch to never have to make a real decision   we don t have the data   yet     But there are a lot of things you DO know but simply   and to your detriment   choose to ignore   Ignorance is not Bliss  You might choose to ignore what you know because you don t think what you know to be true is valid  Perhaps it s imposter syndrome or the like getting in your way  But whatever the reason  you just don t trust what you know to be true   Some ignore these things because they don t even realize they know it in the first place  usually because they never stopped to think about it  It s easy to get caught up in the day to day grind that is business and never take a step back to think  which makes it easy to overlook the valuable insights sitting right in front of you   And of course  some people ignore these things not because they don t know them  but because they need to make the sale so they can get that money   Maybe it s a nefarious money grab  certainly  the last one fits into that category   or maybe it s a misguided  self persuaded  take care of stakeholders  stretching a bit more than you should money grab   Either way  it s a money grab  and one that has a much higher interest rate than you were prepared to pay  This is where the story gets good  y all   How Churning Just Three Customers Hurt Growth  I worked with a company that signed three customers whom they shouldn t have signed   Those customers did not have Technology Fit  the most obvious of the five inputs into Success Potential   which should have been a non starter because there was a 0  chance those customers would be successful when the product they re using is built on a third party system they don t use and won t acquire   Non  Freakin  Starter  Or it should be  especially if you claim to have Customer Success as your operating philosophy or model   But they signed those three bad fit customers anyway   If you have bad fit customers   or just aren t sure   I wrote a whole post on what you need to do ASAP from a Customer Success Management perspective     25k Annual Recurring Revenue  ARR  deals   Sounds good  right  Remember that   75k ARR total   Make those monies   So those customers ended up actively canceling  literally working to get out of their contracts  which  in the early days of a startup  were written on the customer s  paper    or in their favor   so the contracts were easy to get out of   taking all of the  75k the company had booked with them   But those three customers also took with them the  75k ARR from the future 3 or 5 or 7 years that they d remain a customer  not including any expansion revenue  plus the money spent to acquire  Customer Acquisition Cost or CAC and serve them   Starts to add up  right   Those customers didn t just end up not making that company any money  but they actually cost money in CAC and cost to serve   In fact  the cost to serve bad fit customers is often much  much higher than the cost to serve customers with Success Potential  Companies generally end up diverting resources from the customers with Success Potential who could actually benefit from their attention to those that  regardless of effort  will not be successful   Anyway  don t worry  it gets worse   Those customers also took with them the potential value of all the customers who   because of the negative sentiment they d create in the market   now wouldn t do business with my client in the future   That stings   Typically  I like to say that when a customer churns  they also take some unquantifiable number of customers that won t do business with you because of the negative market sentiment caused by all that churn   But we could actually quantify this  and it s bad  man  Real bad   So those three bad fit customers are gone now  Lessons were learned  and they brought me in to help from there   And the first thing I had them do was to operationalize the process of no longer knowingly acquiring bad fit customers   Learning from Lost Deals  The second thing we did is leverage an outside party to start interviewing churned customers  customers we won  to determine the real reason we won  like  you were 50  of the closest competitor  vs  what they told us   and prospects we lost to competitors   And it was in those lost deal interviews that the names of the three customers they signed that didn t have Technology Fit came up time and again   In fact  over the course of 18 months  the name of those former customers came up 13 times   13 times     You see  all three of those customers went to the closest competitor at the time and told them about their terrible experience with my client   Now  if you think the competitor would say   Okay  thanks for telling me  that s our little secret   then you don t know how things work in the real world   Instead  the competitor said   Tell me more   and got a ton of intel on the way my client did business and used that against them in the sales cycle  And the companies that were angry at my client  They were more than willing to be advocates against them and then advocate for the vendor they favored   All of this made my client s sales cycles longer  increased their overall CAC  and decreased the efficiency of that CAC by lowering the annual contract value  ACV  of new customers because of the provisions and concessions required to get customers to commit   The competitor s tactic of parading these three failed implementations in front of prospects continued to successfully knock my client out of the running for at least 18 months after those bad fit customers churned despite the fact that my client s business practices were far more customer positive than in the past   Just Blame Sales   It s easy to put the blame on the sales organization or the salespeople that closed those three bad fit customers   And yeah  they likely should carry some of the blame  ignorance isn t a defense   But I don t put the blame just on sales  that s the easy way out   I blame the sales leadership for focusing so much on hitting their short term numbers that they were willing to allow their sales people to acquire revenue that would ultimately REDUCE the value of the company  more on this later    I blame the executive leadership for allowing the sales leadership to let their salespeople get away with closing bad fit customers   In fact  if the same executives are knowingly allowing bad fit customers to be signed WHILE actively investing in Customer Success Management  they re bad at their jobs  Why invest in people  processes  and systems to make the customer successful when you re allowing customers without Success Potential to be signed  You re just setting everyone up for failure  That makes zero sense   Salespeople should be educated on what a bad fit customers look like  instructed to not sign them  and perhaps even incentivized on post sale metrics like retention  activation  expansion  and engagement even if those are  and they should be  outside of the sales person s control   Most sales people won t knowingly sign a bad fit customer once they know the customer is a bad fit  but if they ve never been told  is it their fault or the fault of management   Calculating the Damage  If the customers that churned had stayed just 3 years  that would have been  225k in recurring revenue total   Instead  my client got nothing   That should be quite upsetting   If you re wondering  yes  it gets worse   Those 13 customers that didn t sign because of those three that churned and spread the negative word   if they were just  25k ARR deals  and that s the minimum  they could have been much bigger  and those customers stayed 3 years without expanding their relationship with my client   that s  325k ARR  or  975k total  that was lost because of those three customers they churned and burned   Let me cipher up the bill so far   Take the  225k from the three customers that churned   25k   3   3   225k   and add the  975k from the 13 that they didn t sign   25k   13   3    975k    That s  1 2M in revenue over 3 years lost that is 100  attributable to those three bad fit customers that were signed  churned  and burned   Remember  these were customers my client KNEW were a bad fit but decided   It s okay as long as we learn something     1 200 000 00   And if the average customer lifetime is more than 3 years   and it is now  BTW   that number goes up significantly   But at least they learned something  right   Oh  but it gets WAY worse   Negative Impact on Company Valuation  So what my client lost with those 16 customers  3 churns   13 losses  was  400 000 ARR   I ve detailed before how Customer Success has a direct impact on the value of a company  and in this case the lack of a focus on the customer s success means  at their 5x valuation multiple at the time   2M   400k   5  wasn t added to the value of their company   But they needed to learn  right   NO   No  they didn t need to learn that a prospect that doesn t   AND is unwilling to   use the base product upon which their product is built is going to fail   They knew that  That s a given   But they chose to ignore it for the short term money grab   So  uh  that  25k they ended up getting from those customers hardly seems worth it compared to the  1 2M in revenue and  2M in company value they lost because of them  does it   Oh  but it gets even worse   The Hurt Could Actually be 5x Bigger   Those third party interviews where the intel on lost deals came from only have a hit rate   on a good day   of 20    That means  for every five lost deals contacted  only one will engage with the interviewer   That means it s entirely possible that there could have been 65  13 prospects interviewed   5  prospects that were lost because of those three that churned  The real number is probably somewhere between 13 and 65  but it is almost 100  guaranteed that it s more than what we could directly quantify   And if those 65 lost deals are assumed to be the minimum ACV of  25k and to stay 3 years  without expansion   then the amount of lost revenue could be  1 625M ARR   That s  4 875M in lost revenue over 3 years   And if you have a valuation multiple of just 5x revenue  then that lost revenue of  1 625M ARR would also equal a loss of  8 125 000 in company value   But it was totally worth it to churn and burn those three customers  right   If you aren t sure  know this  it gets even worse   Now the Valuation Multiplier Takes a Hit  All of that negative sentiment they created in the market by churning and burning just three customers didn t just cost them in revenue and company value   No  by negatively impacting key metrics that go into the multiplier investors applied to my client s revenue to come up with the value of the company  churn  CAC  Net Revenue Retention or NRR  total addressable market  market sentiment  etc    this churning and burning of customers actually negatively impacted the multiplier   Essentially  the multiplier is the investor s confidence in the company  or at least the management   if it s going down  that s a really bad sign   So  sticking with the known 16 lost customers  I guess the silver lining is that the multiplier dropped to 4 5x  down from 5x  revenue  so all they lost was  1 8M in company value  down from  2M   And if you think that s somehow good  you re doing it wrong  All of it   The multiplier reduction means the overall company value went down  too  given that the multiplier applies to all revenue  and not just that which is lost   If they were at  10M in revenue  their company valuation went from  50M to  45M   a  5M loss in value   At least they learned  right   Flame on   The moral of this tale is simple  you don t have to churn and burn to LEARN THINGS YOU  SHOULD  ALREADY KNOW

1053,training-dataset/product/94.txt,product,Designing a better ecommerce sales chat experienceLast year  a study found that Americans spend about 26 minutes a day texting and 6 minutes a day on voice calls  And a trends report showed that 6 of the top 10 most used apps globally were messaging apps   Messaging is now our go to form of communication   It s natural to send a message whenever we want to interact with friends  family  and even companies  Picking up the phone  That s a last resort especially when you re shopping for products   The shopper s dilemma  Most of us no longer want a sales associates to help us make a decision about what to buy  They re just around to show us where we can find what we ve already researched and are ready to buy   We ve done this because it s difficult to find a person we trust to help us with our purchasing needs  Often  we don t trust the advice of the person in the store  We ll ask our friends for advice and search online for any information we can find about the thing we need to buy   Related  Celebrating exceptional ecommerce design  Expert conversation coupled with commerce  What if there were a person we could chat with when we re researching products  What if they knew what they were talking about  actually owned the product we re interested in  and could answer our questions while we look at the product online   That exists it s called live chat   Many websites and apps have integrated chat into their ecommerce stores it s a great way to answer shoppers  final questions before they check out by connecting them with product experts   The problem  though  is that chat was originally built around the need for customer service after someone makes a purchase   Social media messaging tools are quickly advancing they re integrating photos  videos  audio  location  stickers  GIFs  and even flight information  The features are far ahead of anything ecommerce chat offers   At Needle  we re trying to raise the bar for the ecommerce chat experience and catch up with what users now expect from any messaging service   Problems with conversational commerce  One of the biggest challenges of creating the best experience in online ecommerce chat is that it s tied to an existing website  This is the big difference between chat and messaging apps  A shopper s experience doesn t usually start with chat it starts with the shopper researching existing content about products  Chat enters the picture when shoppers can t find information they need online before they make a purchase decision   So how do you introduce chat as a solution to help the shopper find what they re looking for  Here s what we ve found works   Chat invites  So chat doesn t feel like an afterthought to shoppers  we invite them to have a conversation with a product expert  We ve created smart configuration options to display this invite at the times we feel  and know based off experience and data  are the most appropriate for when a user would feel ready to start their conversation   Usually this happens after someone stays on a page for a certain period of time  Tracking this allows us to make some assumptions  like thinking the shopper might have a question or their level of interest in the product is enough that they re taking the time to decide whether it s what they need   A lot of the decisions we ve made about when and where to present these invites comes from real life experiences you get in a brick and mortar retail stores  When was the last time you walked into a physical store and a worker immediately asked what they could help you with  It s an immediate turnoff  even if they re an expert  The same feeling can happen to someone shopping online  and we solve this issue by creating an opportunity for the product experts to have conversations with the shoppers who are more likely to be ready to have a conversation rather than just brush them off   Once the shopper opens the door to a conversation  there are some other challenges in providing a good chat experience   Full sidebar  One of those challenges is chat tools covering up store content  An in real life example  dropping a huge sign in front of the product I m looking at right as an employee walks up to ask if I have any questions   To solve this problem online  we designed our new conversations console to be a full sidebar integration that slides in without covering up any content  This allows the shopper to interact with the product expert while still being able to browse the site without conflict  Responsive ecommerce sites will provide the most optimal experiences   Expandable widgets  Allowing the chat to better utilize the space provides a better experience through the product expert  and it helps the chat feel more integrated into the store   We ve designed and tested multiple features for the product expert within the chat tool  previewing a product  product recommendations  and the ability to purchase a product  We re learning from these tests and we ve found the best solution is to provide these tools directly inline within the conversation  One of the largest benefits of our console is the ability to have inline product information in context within the conversation tied directly to an online store catalog   Scalable solution  Inline widgets allow us to add additional tools in a scalable way without introducing added complex user navigation and organization  For example  we have multiple widgets that can be integrated into your chat depending on your needs  Say you were a clothing brand and shoppers aren t just there to buy a single item they re looking for an outfit  Giving the product experts the tools to create a collection of items and recommend an outfit would create a richer experience for the shopper  We re taking a lot of cues from the aforementioned rich features of current messaging apps today   Ultimate shopping assistant solution  Widgets coupled with a full sidebar create the best shopping assistant experience in existence   Trusting the product advice  Another big challenge in designing a sales chat solution is helping the shopper know they can trust the advice they re getting  Our goal is to help the shopper learn as much as they can about the product expert as quickly as possible and with progressive disclosure  Given our short attention span these days  establishing credibility quickly is key   Product expert bio  We do this by providing a quick bio right as the chat opens so the shopper immediately knows who they re talking to  We know people are quick to judge first impressions matter  So we put this front and center   We also know people are more inclined to trust third party verified experts  so quickly making it clear that these are verified product experts outside the walls of the brand adds value and credibility   Product recommendations  The new conversations console will provide the tools a product expert needs and one of those is a rich product recommendation tool  Recommendations help a shopper find the best product that suits them  Since this is core to the whole shopping experience  we ve focused a lot of our attention to making this a delightful experience  Here are a few ways we ve optimized the Needle chat to facilitate the delivery of quality product recommendations   1  Inline product recommendations cards  When a product expert recommends a product  it s displayed inline within the conversation in context to what the shopper is asking about   2  Expandable recommendations  Shoppers like recommendations  but they also want to see the most detailed product image possible so they can verify it s right for them  They like to see a product up close as if they re holding it  but not in a way that complicates their experience  To facilitate better product visibility  we ve created a product recommendation widget that s expandable  When a recommendation is first sent to a shopper  it displays at its default size an optimal size that doesn t take up too much vertical space in the chat experience but still provides a rich inline card with product imagery  If a shopper wants to see a larger image  they can expand it and even pinch and zoom right within the chat console   3  Pinning a recommendation  Inspired by Instagram  we added a similar functionality where widgets are pinned to the top of the screen as they scroll so they can quickly return to it within the conversation with just a simple tap   Product outfit recommendations  Given our product is used across a wide range of product categories sporting goods  apparel  footwear  electronics  home  and more we ve created tools that help shoppers when they need to buy a set of products  We created the product outfit recommendation widget to allow the product experts to select a set of products to recommend to the shopper   An example  A shopper is looking for a new outfit to wear to a party  A product expert could recommend one set of products at a time until they get a sense of what the person is looking for and then create an  outfit  they could purchase all together  This widget provides a way to better communicate with a shopper and allows them to create a collection that fits the style of the shopper   Meet user expectations  Messaging apps and conversational commerce are becoming more and more common  and our expectations for those experiences are rising  Until ecommerce chat services catch up with messaging apps  they re missing a huge opportunity to influence purchasing decisions and increase sales   I believe we re doing this at Needle  We re excited to get our new chat tool rolled out to our current customers  See it in action or request a demo,"[1053 101 1057 23 484 999 1071 13

1055,training-dataset/business/963.txt,business,The 3 biggest sales mistakes enterprise software companies makeFor early  to mid stage B2B software and SaaS companies  selling in to the enterprise is hard  Getting a lot of enterprise customers to pay for your solution on a repeated and long term basis without seeing your sales growth stall out at  15 25 million ARR  That s really hard   Welcome to the challenging world of enterprise sales   Companies like Salesforce  Workday  NetSuite and athenahealth found lasting B2B sales success and turned their companies into pillars of the enterprise SaaS ecosystem  But the majority of private enterprise companies still face this Mount Everest of a challenge  Many factors can slow a company s B2B sales progress  including competitive challenges  timing issues and product deficiencies   Here are three big sales mistakes we see private enterprise software companies make   Mistake No  1  Good product market fit is not good enough  George Mathew  president COO of Alteryx says   In today s enterprise software market  it s important to define a user experience that is 100 times better than the status quo    There are a number of reasons for this  including the fact that inertia  incumbency and bureaucracy are all working against you  For emerging companies  this means finding a way to be exponentially better with fewer resources  As a result  focus is key   Yammer co founder David Sacks addressed this when he took over as CEO of Zenefits earlier this year   Companies execute better when they ruthlessly prioritize and sequence their efforts   Sacks wrote   For us  that means hyper focusing on the small business market where we have product market fit    To succeed  resist the urge to broaden your focus too much or too soon  and then scale proportionately   What does this mean    hyper focusing   where we have product market fit   It means pursuing those market segments for which your product has a unique and compelling solution   exponentially better than the status quo   and pursuing only those segments   Many private B2B companies have developed solutions that are working for a subset of customers  but are still challenged with sales cycles longer than ideal  Average revenue per customer remains below the target  Or new customer sales growth is incremental  not exponential  In other words  the product market fit is not compelling enough   Sometimes the market fit issue with developing enterprise companies stems from insufficient focus  Ruthless prioritization  as advocated by Sacks  does not come naturally  Market fit can improve from having more ongoing dialogue with customers  For targeted sectors  your solution may simply be just a nice to have service and not compelling enough to overcome typical enterprise barriers   With more market focus  however  companies can find a sweet spot by developing an acute understanding of customers  needs in a particular segment  which is more nuanced than the broader sector requirements  To succeed  resist the urge to broaden your focus too much or too soon  and then scale proportionately   Mistake No  2  Are you competitively disadvantaged   Competitors come in many different shapes and sizes  As Zendesk CEO Mikkel Svane says   There s an incredible variety of software products out there    Indeed  read the  About Us  section of all the companies in your market universe  and consider how many of those view your space as theirs  Your competitors include other private companies and larger established incumbents with massive sales organizations  You also compete with customers  own internally developed efforts  which may be inferior but can be difficult to overcome given ties to their own solution   Invest time to glean important  insightful information about your competitors   Competition also includes service and reselling companies that represent third party vendors   AppDirect co CEO Daniel Saks points out that 70 percent of on premise software sales have traditionally been channel based  He adds   80  of on premise software vendors operate a channel program to enable other companies to sell their products  while only 20  of SaaS vendors operate similar programs    This channel and reselling hurdle highlights a competitive challenge for SaaS companies facing off against traditional software vendors  It s a zero sum game among vendors  so signing a customer means a loss for someone else   One often overlooked step is simply engaging with customers about the competitive landscape   including prospective as well as won lost targets  Invest time to glean important  insightful information about your competitors and adapt accordingly   Mistake No  3  Bad timing   outta sync  outta luck  With enterprise sales  timing can make or break a company  Bad timing in the B2B sales process can stem from several factors  Here are three common timing issues   Timing problem No  1  You re behind the market demand curve with a not exponentially better product   and losing to competitors or incumbents   If you don t give customers sufficient reasons to make a change  you will encounter too much inertia to close business  The enterprise customer s default action is to stick with their current solution  Be aggressive in solving this problem by uncovering more unique  urgent requirements  and then credibly and proactively addressing those  More target market focus and customer driven product iteration can help you move ahead of the curve   Timing problem No  2  You re ahead of the market demand curve and struggling to close sales   Enterprise markets can be unwelcoming to pioneers  so consider finding ways to bridge an entrenched solution to your ahead of the curve solution  For example  TigerText introduced a secure enterprise mobile messaging platform to healthcare customers in 2010 but faced resistance from hospital employees that still relied on pagers  To overcome this  they developed a messaging solution that included paging options  To get your foot in the door  you may need to support valued but possibly outdated requirements to help companies transition to your platform   Timing problem No  3  You re suffering under the weight of a long sales cycle and not closing enough deals quickly enough   SaaS products and business models have shortened sales cycles in some sectors for a number of purchases in recent years  e g  see Harry Stebbings  interview with Immediately s CEO Branko Cerny   This is not true for all purchases in all enterprise markets  however  including large purchases in regulated industries or many Global 2000 companies   How to accelerate slow sales cycles  What to do about those long and costly sales cycles    Selling to the consumer is about selling positive emotions  Selling to the enterprise is about suppressing negative emotions   says GoodData CEO Roman Stanek   Enterprise IT is not a culture of early adopters    He is right   but there are a few practical strategies that can get slow moving targets to move   Employing best practices with your sales and marketing processes is critical  In many Global 2000 companies  there are multiple groups of decision makers or influencers involved  including product users  IT gatekeepers  administrative or executive groups and compliance teams  any of which can slow down your sales process   With incomplete information flowing back to the sales team  it s critical to measure and track all customer communication and best practices by carefully utilizing your CRM and marketing automation tools   and then managing your team accordingly  Work to build a company wide culture to document customer communications and make best practices repeatable across sales  marketing  customer success and business development teams   Also  there are countless times that we have seen large  long term enterprise deals go to a competitor that has successfully triangulated the buying process or leveraged backchannels  Your team s success in triangulating with customer targets and establishing backchannels of communication with friendly insiders is vital to winning long sales cycle deals   In fact  even though your product is B2B  perhaps the biggest mistake you can make is forgetting that your sales process is still P2P  peer to peer   Executives make decisions for all sorts of reasons that are not based simply on product features or depth of IP  With a long sales cycle  building rapport at many levels in the customer organization chart is critically important  Mastering these softer P2P skills can help drive successful triangulation and backchanneling  which lead directly to more enterprise sales    We ve seen that successful enterprise sales stem from a variety of factors   says Nick Elprin  CEO of Domino Data Lab   But in closing the largest and most important deals  people skills are ultimately at the top of that list    Agreed   Featured Image  Michele Paccione

1057,training-dataset/product/1279.txt,product,Design for relevance  then usabilityUsability testing is great when you re trying to figure out if something is usable   But what happens when you re trying to understand whether a product or feature resonates  You re likely using the wrong tool for the job at hand   The average usability test goes something like this   You instruct a few tech savvy shoppers to try a new product or service like an online grocer for the first time  and give them a discrete set of instructions  Find a cookie recipe on the online grocery website  then  using that recipe  add cookie ingredients to your cart  Finish by selecting a time for home delivery   You ask these users to think aloud as they navigate the website and discuss why they choose a particular brand of milk or eggs   These shoppers are performing for you  Because they follow your instructions  your results nearly always come back skewed  the only thing you can measure is their ability to add groceries to their cart and click checkout  But you ll never really know the drivers behind why they purchase online groceries  pick certain ingredients  or choose specific delivery windows  That s understanding what s relevant   We spend hours recruiting and screening users  defining business goals  creating tasks  composing scripts  crafting prototypes  and running usability tests all while dancing around the question we really care about   Relevance is finding product market fit  It s seeing whether a user is even interested in a concept  product  or feature  It s hard to measure relevance  but it s possible using digital ethnography  for example   Imagine if you simply watched someone shop on Instacart  Then you shut up and observe them  With free reign to roam  the shopper might pull a recipe from another website  poke around Instacart  find some ingredients  and check their calendar for delivery  Your product s experience may be linear  but your user s experience with it won t be   In this test  the grocery shopper chooses what s most relevant  And by watching them make choices on their own instead of following a set of directions  you ll discover contextual clues that drive their purchase behaviors and the mental checklist people use when planning a grocery delivery   You ll gain empathy by observing natural user behaviors and  as a result  get a better read on usability  You ll find patterns and unlock opportunities to improve your user experience   But even by observing users  there s still one missing piece  a clear picture on relevance   A user typically needs just a few moments to determine whether your product  new feature  or idea is relevant to them  and just about 30 seconds to explain why   Over the past year  I ve been working on an approach to give product designers rich  relevance  feedback that s quick to gather and easy to process   We ve tested products in the idea stage  InVision prototypes  and newly launched mobile apps  Understanding relevance takes priority over usability and  even for mobile apps  usability plays just a small role in whether your product is relevant to users  There s a reason Quettra shows that 77  of apps lose Daily Active Users within 3 days  Most products from concept to executed ideas just fail to resonate   Everyone has a toolkit of apps  for personal and professional purposes  Take a moment to think about your toolkit  even if you have 50 apps on your phone  only a handful may be actually relevant in a given day  Here are a few in my toolkit   Hopper  I can shop around for flights  and get flight alerts and predictions from my phone  InVision  I can create a prototype in minutes  and use the tool to collaborate with customers and colleagues  Croissant  I can check into any co working space when traveling and pay by the hour  But what happens when an already relevant product introduces a new feature  I used dscout Sprint to determine whether Instagram Stories was relevant to real people  Here s what they said    Instagram Stories is usable  Most anyone can open the app and view a story  The story feed seamlessly fits the Instagram UI  It s easy to create a story  view a story  to tap back and forth between stories    But are Stories relevant  Through their posts  Instagram users illustrate a story over time creating a heavily curated collection of memories that expresses each user s favorite moments  There s an entire ecosystem to help Instagram users craft the perfect photo and get the most likes  For users  swiping through Instagram is the equivalent of flipping through a magazine  You pause to read a caption  and you write in the margins of your favorites   It s really easy to assemble an Instagram Story  but with Stories  it s really hard to capture the Instagram worthy moments that belong in a user s main feed  Instagram  at its core  is about precious moments  not the fleeting  everyday moments that Snapchat harnessed into a billion dollar product  The bar for good quality content is high enough that most users don t even try to create a meaningful Instagram story   Usability is crucial to product design and development  But product teams shouldn t misuse usability testing to infer relevance  They should perform usability tests to optimize validated  relevant features   Establish relevance first  and optimize for usability later  If a feature or product idea isn t relevant  ditch it  In the end  it s possible that your product will be even more usable   So how do you test for relevance  There s no boilerplate way to measure it  On the quantitative side  you can track email signups  whether people click buy buttons  and impressions  On the qualitative side  you can spend hours to recruit users and meet with them one on one  or you can take advantage of digital ethnography tools to test for relevancy in just a few moments   After a year s worth of testing different ways to get feedback on concepts and determine relevance  I ve settled on the following framework   First  I give my test subjects a new prototype or app concept  even a one pager works  with just enough direction to get them started  After they ve explored it for a bit  I give them the following prompt   You ll often learn in 30 seconds what a usability test might show you in 15 minutes  whether your product is relevant  Thirty seconds forces the user to make a quick decision and only discuss what matters to them  Less is more   Here s what you ll get in those 30 seconds   Hits  Learn what really resonates with users  Build around these for growth   Misses  Learn what falls flat  Expose where your product is weakest in the user s mind  Discover holes in the experience   Discover holes in the experience  Wishes  Identify what would make the product relevant  Inform your roadmap by unlocking the features people think should come next   These 30 seconds will also reveal what people don t talk about  Most usability tests focus on watching a user s ability to find specific aspects of a product  Why spend 15 minutes to discover whether an advanced feature is easy to access when you can simply ask whether it s relevant in 30 seconds   For example  you d want to see if Uber jetpacks resonates before spending years to build the feature and buy all that jetpack fuel   This framework won t tell you everything  it s a starting point for when a user examines a concept  plays with a prototype  or downloads and uses your app for the first time  It s certainly worthwhile to observe users  to ask indirect questions  and poke at what excites users in the first place   So when your team wants to run another usability test  ask yourself  Have you first established relevance,"[1057 431 215 642 1212 850 1121 859 348 1253

1071,training-dataset/business/532.txt,business,Want Your Startup to Keep Growing  Become a  Next  Company    Product HabitsThere are two ways to get SaaS businesses off the ground  they either start with product  or they start with movement   David Cummings explains it best in his short article    Product first companies absolutely adore their own product  Everything centers around building an amazing product that customers love and everything else comes second    Product first companies focus entirely on building an amazing product in their early days  Their dominant sales and marketing strategy is that the  product should sell itself   and they rely on word of mouth to scale their business early on   Product first companies often take off initially because they beat out the existing competition  In time  the playing field levels and they have to move to new markets or undercut the competition   On the other hand  Cummings says    Movement first companies are on a mission greater than themselves  Everything centers around educating the market about this better way to do things  most often through live events and heavy sales and marketing    Early on  movement first companies focus on generating awareness around them  They do a great job of talking to their audience and identifying the pain points that they re trying to solve  Over time  more companies move into the space with better products   Whether you re a product first or movement first company  eventually you have to completely refocus your strategy and become a   next  company   Product First   Movement Next  If you re building a product first company  you re often a developer or an engineer who s found a glaring problem  You know you can fix it better than the solutions out there  so you build a company out of it   If you re   Monopolizing your current market  Trying to move upmarket and win larger customer accounts  Not developing traction for new products   then it s time to rethink your business

1104,training-dataset/product/614.txt,product,Product Management is About Making Mistakes74 Flares 74 Flares    Once upon a time  I met a product manager of a company who was leading a freemium model product  with some success  He regularly interviewed users to work out their needs  he gathered and analyzed usage data of the product to extract new requirements  and he defined new features with a high level of detail   A Shiny new Feature  One day  he devised a new feature that promised to increase the free to paid users conversion rate by 5   It was not a naive and under researched wish  He collected loads of usage data  analyzed it and found a potential improvement to the user interface of the product that would  according to his calculations  lead to a substantial increase in the conversion rate  and by turn the company s revenues   The feature was developed on schedule  and successfully launched to a controlled group of users  The product manager measured the results  and astonishingly  the conversion increased by nearly 20   This was a great deal better than anyone had expected  so it was rolled out to the entire user base the next day  Conversion to paid started to grow in an incredible pace  leading a proportional growth in revenues than made everyone in the company proud of the work that had been done   But  the celebrations didn t last long  Dozens of emails arrived with customer support  complaining that the company was forcing them to become premium users overnight  What was happening  No one was forcing them to pay in order to continue using the service   The product manager did not understand  He started to go deep into the usage data for the new feature and found out that hundreds of users were signing out of the service  He couldn t believe it  He scheduled a few calls and video conferences with users who had complained or stopped using the service  and finally he understood what was causing this exodus   Misunderstanding at the User Interface  The user interface copy for the new call to action had been misunderstood by most users  it made them believe they had to pay or the service would no longer be available to them  Of course  this led users to choose between two options  pay or leave  This explained both results  the huge increase in conversion and the exit of so many users   It was a terrible mistake  Nothing on earth would have made the product manager believe that the 20  conversion rate growth he saw with the control group would lead to such a catastrophic result when launching the feature for everybody   Now  if you ve reached this point of the article  you deserve some honesty from me   I was that product manager   With hindsight  I see there were several measures that I could have taken to avoid the error  I could have tested the new UI on real users even before passing it to the development team  gone deeper in the analysis I did on the control group  and so on    Unfortunately  I let myself get so carried away by the excitement of growing revenues that I missed umpteen checks that would had avoided the tragedy   But  a few days later  rather than continuing to blame myself for the mistake  I assumed that this kind of thing can occur   stuff happens  I just had to move on  keep working hard and  believe it or not  keep making mistakes   Developing new products and making decisions around them implies taking risks  And things can go wrong  What is key is how we react to them and how we overcome the difficulties we find on a daily basis   Making mistakes is not a big issue  The key thing here is to avoid making the same mistakes again  If we do this it means we are learning from them,"[1104 348 999 1214 1282 442 1239 378 1212 1164 741]"
1121,training-dataset/product/1010.txt,product,Scott Belsky on the importance of your product s first mileYour product can get millions of signups or downloads  but it counts for little if you can t get new users past the first few hurdles  Entrepreneur  author and investor Scott Belsky calls this your product s  first mile   and he s seen first hand what it takes to get it right  Following a stint at Goldman Sachs  Scott founded the online design community and portfolio platform Behance  acquired by Adobe in 2012  Meanwhile  Scott was an angel investor for a some of the world s biggest brands  including Warby Parker  Uber  Pinterest and Periscope  He joined Benchmark Capital  where he s currently a Venture Partner  in February 2016 and advises companies that sit at the intersection of design and technology  In my chat with Scott  we discuss how to onboard new users successfully  how to keep your product simple and why not all customers are created equal  If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the interview  but if you re short on time  here are five key takeaways  As the co founder of Behance  Scott has seen more than his fair share of portfolios  What makes a good one  It tells a story and takes someone from ideation through fruition  With so much technology being commoditized  Scott sees the interface as where your product or service distinguishes itself  In the first 15 30 seconds of every new customer s experience of a product  they are lazy  vain and selfish  This is your product s first mile  and it s something you must consider early in the design process  The key to keeping your product simple over time is to stay empathetic to new users and consistently optimize and revisit your product s first mile  There s an intuitive logic that you want every customer you can get  but in reality  different customers will better serve your business at different stages  Geoffrey Keating  Scott  thanks for joining us  You re currently a venture partner at Benchmark Capital after a long career in product  which is quite interesting  Could you give us the CliffsNotes versions of how you got to where you are today  Scott Belsky  As an undergrad I studied both design and business  I wasn t really sure which avenue to take  although business always had a real pull  Then I took a traditional Wall Street internship in 2001 and a job full time in 2002  That was a great experience  but I wanted to go back to my interest in design and the creative industry  I was obsessed with this one problem   how do you organize the creative world  How do you foster attribution and transparency in one of the most disorganized communities in the planet  but also an industry that really changes the quality of life for all of us  That led to the idea of Behance  We bootstrapped for five years  venture backed for a couple of years and then we re acquired by Adobe in the end of 2012  That was a real journey of almost squeezing blood from stone at times trying to make a business work  trying to build many things and refine it back to core things  I stayed at Adobe for more than three years  not only integrating Behance but also helping oversee the mobile product strategy and creative cloud services  which I actually really enjoyed  All the while I ve been investing in many different companies since 2010  which is what made me say   Okay  Let s spend more time investing  roll up our sleeves and help get a few things off the ground again   That s my mode right now  I m investing in new companies as a seed investor  an extended member of the Benchmark team  and helping get a couple new companies off the ground as well  Geoffrey  Behance is very focused on helping creative people get their ideas out there  Did you always identify yourself as a creative person  Scott  I did  Inside I always thought   I wish my skills are better   when it came to actual design and some of the things I found interesting in college  I just never pursued that career path as a profession  The closest I could get was helping organize designers  and as a leader of different companies or teams  helping empower design in the process of building a business and then the process of crafting product  That s a perfect overlap of my interest and why I spend so much time in it   Scott co founded Behance in 2006  Adobe acquired the product in 2012  The art of the portfolio Geoffrey  Given your work on Behance I have to ask  what makes a good portfolio  Scott  A good portfolio tells a story  The problem with portfolios is that every portfolio is a lie  Every portfolio includes work that not only you did  but other people contributed to   whether it was the photograph you used  a typographer who made the font you used or an illustrator you partnered with  Every portfolio really represents a collection of people contributing and working together towards something  What actually matters in a portfolio is the problem you are trying to solve   what you actually did as part of that project and the story  Did you go back and forth  Did you have a few ideas at first and then you ended up picking one  That s the type of thing that helps someone determine who they want to work with as a partner   how they went through the story  how someone thinks through an idea to fruition  Geoffrey  Do you find that designers are too focused on showing the final  polished elements of their design rather than the rough sketches  Scott  Yeah  one thing I would see on Behance that I didn t like was only showing the polished end or only taking little snapshots of something like a drop shadow at the corner of a product that you did  In some ways you re making your work look better than it may have been  because you re not willing to show the whole thing  That s another thing that a lot of design communities are guilty of  Allowing designers to show a little hint of something without really showing the full context  which is actually what really matters  Design is only effective in the context of what it s being presented in  Geoffrey  Do designers spend too much focusing on things like the interface rather than solving the actual underlying problems  Design is only effective in the context of what it s being presented in  Scott  At best designers are always grounded by a problem and are not taking design direction in terms of what they should be doing design wise  but rather direction in where they re not answering or solving the problem effectively  The interface is where a lot of great problems are solved  but the other thing that designers are liable to do is borrow things that work for other products  They put something into theirs without thinking about the context and all of the other aspects that user s experience and what needs to change to support that addition they made  That s why there s no shortcuts to design  That s one of the reason why I tend to have a problem with open source or crowdsourcing spec contests for design  and engaging a designer in one particular part of a project without really engaging them in the whole course of the project  Design is start to finish  The commoditization of design and tech Geoffrey  You wrote in 2014 that design is becoming a commodity  This is something our director of design  Emmett  would certainly echo  It s 2017 now  Do you now this trend has worsen  Scott  I don t know if I feel that it s really becoming a commodity in the sense that the competitive advantage for most businesses is design  Therefore  bringing designers in house  empowering designers  making sure that designers have a seat at the table in the full decision making process  partnering designers with product leaders  and making designers product leaders themselves rather than having them treat it as like an internal or an external agency  is super important these days  Bad design is becoming commoditized in a sense that it s more accessible  You can just rip someone else s piece off or get something done on a crowdsourcing site or something  Great design in my belief is more of a competitive advantage these days in technology than the actual technology  So much of a tech stack is now being commoditized  You can just roll in with a few lines of code  There are great services for payment  tracking  analytics  shipping and everything else  Those things that used to be the competitive advantage of companies trying to change industries are now more commoditized  Now it s really the interface itself where you distinguish your product or service  Geoffrey  You mentioned designers  seat at the table  In the companies you advise  what do you encourage designers to do with that seat at the table  Scott  First of all you have to help frame the internal objectives through design  The business plan means nothing when it s tucked away in a Microsoft Word Doc or Google Doc  What makes a business plan and a set of milestones come alive is when some design is applied to it  Then that plan  that strategy  is merchandised to the rest of the team in a way that they ll relate to  which is what design is all about  Internal communications can be reinvigorated by a designer with a seat at the table  Then the second thing is to make sure that these endless debates about strategy  product  pricing  etc start with mockups  So much debate can be prevented by showing something rather than everyone telling each other their opinion  Designers can really thrive by making sure people start with something visual that they can relate to  Putting up straw mans that people can engage and debate around rather than these hypothetical questions  Mastering your product s first mile Geoffrey  You published a great piece on Medium last year   Crafting the First Model of a Product   It s about the temptation of many startups to focus on existing users rather new ones  What exactly is the first mile and why are people tempted to overlook it  Scott  Once someone comes to your product  downloads it  signs up  joins and does a few key things that shows them the longer term potential of your product in their life  you re golden  That s all about keeping someone engaged and building a roadmap for the coming years of features to better serve the customer   that s actually where everyone spends the majority of their time  but it s further down the funnel from what customers go through initially  That first mile of  what does the tour look like  What is the copy  What is the onboarding process like  What questions are you asking or aren t you asking  What s the default  What do you see first  What s the first action and how are you oriented around why you re there and what you re going to do next  That is actually what matters for a successful product  It s easier to get someone to give you faith in the roadmap once they re further than that  but to get that far is where most companies struggle  In ultimate irony  that first mile of the user s experience tends to be the last mile of the team s experience when it comes to building the product  It s really toward the end where people ask   What should the tour be and what copy should we slap in there  Let s just use the form fields that we think are logical   It doesn t make any sense  It s all about the first mile  In the first 15 30 seconds of every new customer s experience  they are lazy  vain and selfish  The other psychological undertone there is my conviction that in the first 15 30 seconds of every new customer s experience of a product  they are lazy  vain and selfish  They re lazy in the sense that they re not willing to take time to read or learn anything  They re vain in the sense of   Gosh  life is short  I m busy  If I m going to engage in this new thing  it better make me look good   If it s an enterprise product  it better make them look good to their colleagues  If it s a personal product  it better make them look good to their friends or professionally online  Then selfishness is  even if this product is something that helps my team be more productive or is good for the world or is good for a political movement or something else I believe in  at the end of the day for the first 15 30 seconds  I want to make sure that this product solves one of my problems  now  It s one of these grounding things that we must realize as product makers  We can t believe that people will have a relationship with us until they get through that 30 seconds  We can t sell them on the long term vision or get them to invite all these people to make it worth their while  It needs to serve them now  When you ground the decisions you make in that first mile of the product experience for a new user  it triggers things like   Maybe we shouldn t tell them or even show them  Maybe we should just do it for them with a template  with a default field completed   You start to think about differently about little things like that  Getting users to the  the zone  Geoffrey  The first mile is really successful when new users reach what you call  the zone   They re fully onboarded and really finding success within your product  Once users have actually reached that zone  how do you make sure that they stick around  Scott  That s where the core features and empathy come in  One of the mistakes that companies are liable to make at that point when you re keeping your community or your active customers engaged is you become passionate as a team about ideas for the product and then you act upon that passion  In fact  you should become more empathetic to the customers and the new modern problems they re facing and then build a roadmap based on where that empathy leads you  rather than where your passion leads you  It s a very important thing  Some of the most impressive teams that I ve come across always have customers coming into their office  They re always shoulder to shoulder with customers  working through their products  watching them use it  empathizing with the struggles and the frictions they re encountering and acting upon those when it comes to prioritizing the roadmap  Geoffrey  Who is really nailing this first mile right now  Scott  Products like Instagram have certainly figured this out  Products that have proven that they can break through that 500 million user ceiling  In terms of new products  some of the messaging products like Telegram have very smooth onboarding  Slack is especially good at this  They even think about little things like the magic link as opposed to the password  because they realized new users  the second time they come back  don t remember their password  and a magic link sounds great  It s little things like that we can all learn from   Slack s magic link for password recovery is a small  yet impactful addition for new users   Geoffrey  Do you think the first mile is much different for consumer products vs business products  or do the same principles apply  Scott  The same principles definitely apply  It s a mistake that almost the entire venture capital community still makes in the sense that they feel like consumer products need a certain type of investor with a certain type of sensibility  Then an enterprise product investor really needs to focus on other things  not the product user experience  I disagree  These days most of these enterprise products are being adopted from the bottom up  They re being adopted by the teams themselves rather than IT people  At the end of the day  their users also use iPhones and modern day social products  They have the same level of expectation in terms of ease of use and access  It s important to treat every product as a consumer product to some extent  Geoffrey  Something we ve had to deal with at Intercom as our features and user rates have grown is keeping our product as simple as possible  What advice do you give startups when it comes to maintaining simplicity over time  Scott  You guys do this quite well too  To maintain the simplicity  it really comes down to allocating a certain percentage of your energy on an ongoing basis to that first mile experience  Rather than moving on from it once you think it s working  keep coming back to it  auditing it and refining it  New users change over time  New batches of new users are different because your product may now have more credibility in the industry and you may now be engaging pragmatists   people that haven t had as much experience with your product before or your industry as the early adopters   and they re going to have different expectations in that first mile  It s important to constantly optimize that first mile  Why you don t want all of your customers right away Geoffrey  You believe that a startup really doesn t want all of its customers right away  Talk me through that  Scott  The intuitive logic is that you want any customer you can get  There s some truth to that  When you take a step back and start to think about where your product is now  where it s going to be in the near future and where it s going to be in the longer term  you start to actually become a little bit more discriminant about which customers will serve your business the most  In the very beginning  you want customers that are so interested in what you re doing they re willing to tinker through some beta and have a tremendous amount of patience  They re willing to test something  It s a small number of customers  Often times if you keep your aperture on those customers  you will not have to explain or handhold too much  These are just the right people to adopt in the early stages  The next type of customer you want is someone who s forgiving  someone who might be a little less willing to tinker  If there are bugs  they re forgiving  You re not going to lose all of your credibility in their eyes because of something that s not working perfectly  As you start to grow beyond the beta and include more people  you want people that are forgiving  You don t want the super influential people in the industry who know everyone to be trying you  because they might tell everyone before it s really ready for full time  and people who are not forgiving will join and not have a good experience  You have willing people  Then you have forgiving people,"[1121 222 32 709 1239 328 23 1026 1142 549 365]"
1134,training-dataset/business/977.txt,business,A Dozen Lessons About Product Market FitThe product market fit  PMF  concept was developed and named by Andy Rachleff  who is currently the CEO and co founder of Wealthfront  and is a co founder of Benchmark Capital   The core of Rachleff s idea for PMF was based on his analysis of the investing style of the pioneering venture capitalist and Sequoia founder Don Valentine    Why market matters more than anything   Give me a giant market   always    Arthur Rock is the representative of  you find a great entrepreneur and you back him  My position has always been  you find a great market and you build multiple companies in that market    Our view has always  preferably  been  give us a technical problem  give us a big market when that technical problem is solved so we can sell lots and lots and lots of stuff  Do I like to do that with terrific people  Sure  Are we unwilling to invest in companies that don t have them  Sure  We invested in Apple when Steve Jobs was about eighteen or nineteen years old   not only didn t he go to Harvard Business School  he didn t go to any school   Don Valentine    One way to look at venture capital investing and creating a valuable business is as an effort to build a stool with three legs  people  markets  and innovative products  All three legs are required for success  but different venture capitalists and entrepreneurs emphasize and weight each of the three core elements differently at different times  While Valentine believed that yes  of course you need decent people   the marketplace comes first  because you can t change that  but you can change the people   according to Pitch Johnson  who was a venture capital industry pioneer at the same time Valentine was developing his investing style    A famous example of changing people was when the Cisco board of directors replaced the then husband and wife team who founded the company  In other cases  new team members are brought in to supply new skills instead of replacing people  Eric Schmidt being recruited to Google is a famous example of that approach   What is product market fit  really      A value hypothesis is an attempt to articulate the key assumption that underlies why a customer is likely to use your product  Identifying a compelling value hypothesis is what I call finding product market fit  A value hypothesis identifies the features you need to build  the audience that s likely to care  and the business model required to entice a customer to buy your product  Companies often go through many iterations before they find product market fit  if they ever do    When a great team meets a lousy market  market wins  When a lousy team meets a great market  market wins  When a great team meets a great market  something special happens    If you address a market that really wants your product   if the dogs are eating the dog food   then you can screw up almost everything in the company and you will succeed  Conversely  if you re really good at execution but the dogs don t want to eat the dog food  you have no chance of winning   Andy Rachleff  One way to rephrase a key point Rachleff is making is to say that that nothing is as irreplaceable as a great market  In saying this  no one is saying this means that a great team isn t an accelerant to what a great market can enable   The modified Gary Larson cartoon below captures this idea    Nor is anyone rejecting the idea that PMF is needed  There are other venture capitalists  like Pitch Johnson and Arthur Rock  who put the quality of entrepreneurs first  But it s a matter of emphasis and timing  Rachleff observes that if you look at the most successful startups  they actually didn t have  the world s best management teams in the very early days  They happened to have conceived  or more likely pivoted into  an idea that addresses an amazing point of pain around which consumers where desperate for a solution    The process behind product market fit   You often stumble into your product market fit  Serendipity plays a role in finding product market fit but the process to get to serendipity is incredibly consistent  What we do is teach that incredibly consistent process   Andy Rachleff  Even though serendipity plays a role here  there is a process   which is why Rachleff later created and teaches a course at Stanford  Aligning Startups with their Markets  Steve Blank also developed a customer development process based on the idea that startups should apply the scientific method just like scientists do  start with a hypothesis  test it  prove it  move on or further iterate on the hypothesis  Similarly  Rachleff observes that  First you need to define and test your value hypothesis  And then only once proven do you move on to your growth hypothesis  The value hypothesis defines the what  the who  and the how  What are you going to build  who is desperate for it  and what is the business model you are going to use to deliver it   Startups should therefore start with the product and try to find the market  as opposed to starting with the market to find the product  It s important to emphasize here that the iteration is more about the market and the business model than the product itself   Finally  as Reid Hoffman notes   Product market fit requires you to figure out the earliest tells   Using an analogy to poker is appropriate since the process finding PMF fit is an art rather than a science  PMF emerges from experiments conducted by the entrepreneurs  Through a series of build measure learn iterations  PMF is discovered and developed during a process rather than a single Eureka moment  A ha moments of inspiration do happen  but PMF is not created that way   How can you tell whether you do  or don t  have product market fit    You can always feel when product market fit isn t happening  The customers aren t quite getting value out of the product  word of mouth isn t spreading  usage isn t growing that fast  press reviews are kind of  blah   the sales cycle takes too long  and lots of deals never close  And you can always feel product market fit when it s happening  The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it   or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers  Money from customers is piling up in your company checking account  You re hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can  Reporters are calling because they ve heard about your hot new thing and they want to talk to you about it  You start getting entrepreneur of the year awards from Harvard Business School  Investment bankers are staking out your house  You could eat free for a year at Buck s   Marc Andreessen  According to Andreessen   product market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market   But too often the focus is on latter part of the sentence  a product that can satisfy the market  and not the former  in a good market   Andreessen emphasizes that market matters most   You can obviously screw up a great market   and that has been done  and not infrequently   but assuming the team is baseline competent and the product is fundamentally acceptable  a great market will tend to equal success and a poor market will tend to equal failure   That s why time spent building a business around the product alone is pointless   Best case  it s going to be a zombie    in a terrible market  you can have the best product in the world and an absolutely killer team  and it doesn t matter   you re going to fail  You ll break your pick for years trying to find customers who don t exist for your marvelous product  and your wonderful team will eventually get demoralized and quit  and your startup will die   The converse is also true  You can have an OK team and a buggy and incomplete product but if the market is great and you are the best product available success can happen both suddenly and quickly  That success won t last unless those products are fixed  but at least the business has the beginnings of something wonderful    The term product market fit describes  the moment when a startup finally finds a widespread set of customers that resonate with its product    Eric Ries  Lean Startup  p  219   The  satisfy the market  part of the Andreessen definition is where the PMF concept necessarily starts to get qualitative  Various math tests have been devised in an attempt to quantify PMF  but they are proxies for something that is fundamentally like Justice Stewart s famous definition of pornography   I know it when I see it   Even if there is a best practices test for whether PMF exists that does not mean that creating PMF can be reduced to a formula   So what are considered some of the best tests for PMF  Rachleff writes that  You know you have fit if your product grows exponentially with no marketing  That is only possible if you have huge word of mouth  Word of mouth is only possible if you have delighted your customer   Tying together the concepts  Rachleff also shares that entrepreneurs too often confuse product market fit with growth in what Ries calls vanity metrics   numbers or stats that look good on paper  but don t really mean anything important    So what does  Rachleff suggests Net Promoter Score  NPS  as a great tool to predict the magnitude of customer love for one s product service   ideally a score of 40 or higher  to know you re on the right track   However  while NPS is a pretty good proxy for likely fit  it is  not nearly as accurate as having market feedback in the form of purchases   People vote with their dollars  after all    The number one problem I ve seen for startups  is they don t actually have product market fit  when they think they do   Alex Schultz  Many founders seem to believe that what they have developed is the modern equivalent of magic beans and that people will accept them as payment for a cow  My post last weekend on growth talks about the need for an offering to have core product value  Chamath Palihapitiya believes that a value hypothesis is driven by core product value    what the market desires about a product    but that it  is elusive and most products don t have any   And in fact  Rachleff has observed that this is where technology inflection points can play a role   Truly great technology companies are the result of an inflection point in technology that allows the founder to conceive a new kind of product  The question then is  who wants to buy my product   Marc Andreessen writes   In a great market   a market with lots of real potential customers   the market pulls product out of the startup   Ideally in the easiest stages of a product development process pull is happening organically  i e   without any advertising spending    Common misconceptions about product market fit   First to market seldom matters  Rather  first to product market fit is almost always the long term winner    Time after time  the winner is the first company to deliver the food the dogs want to eat    Once a company has achieved product market fit  it is extremely difficult to dislodge it  even with a better or less expensive product   Andy Rachleff  Rachleff has cited examples like Intuit  Apple  and Google as examples of how being the first mover isn t necessarily the advantage here  Facebook was not the first social network either  Finding product market fit is a process that is not unlike  creating a  dance  between the product and the market  as Mike Maples Jr has described it  It also involves taking the most powerful and compelling aspects of the product and delivering them in the form of  WTF  level features that are not merely compelling   they rise to the level of changing people s points of view about what s even possible and create intense delight in customers   To reach that level  the target isn t just product market fit  but  product market scale   observes Casey Winters  As I explained in my previous post on growth  Facebook has a superior approach to generating growth and in a business with network effects that not only captures customers and changed points of view  but keeps out competitors    Product Market Fit Myths  Myth  1  Product market fit is always a discrete  big bang event  Myth  2  It s patently obvious when you have product market fit  Myth  3  Once you achieve product market fit  you can t lose it  and Myth  4  Once you have product market fit  you don t have to sweat the competition   Ben Horowitz    Even though tight product market fit and product market scale help beat out the completion  that doesn t mean that the struggle stops there  Markets and the actions of competitors in that market  which are not always visible to outsiders  are always changing  Constant adaptation is therefore required to retain PMF  Steve Blank observes   What matters is having forward momentum and a tight fact based data metrics feedback loop to help you quickly recognize and reverse any incorrect decisions    One mistake many people make is to believe that the process described in feedback loop diagrams does not apply to them  The reason the process is depicted as a circle is that it is both iterative and continuous  It is highly unlikely that even a hundred internal whiteboard product planning sessions will result in a product that has perfect PMF from the start    Getting product right means finding product market fit  It does not mean launching the product  It means getting to the point where the market accepts your product and wants more of it   Fred Wilson  One of the most common ways that startups die is  premature scaling   a term first used by Steve Blank  A business is  scaling prematurely  if it is spending significant amounts of money on growth before it has discovered and developed PMF  Steve Blank describes one important reason why premature scaling can happen   Ironically  one of the greatest risks   is high pressure expectations to make these first pass forecasts that subvert an honest Customer Development process  The temptation is to transform the vision of a large market into a solid corporate revenue forecast   before Customer Development even begins   A study conducted by Startup Genome concluded    Startups need 2 3 times longer to validate their market than most founders expect  This underestimation creates the pressure to scale prematurely  In our dataset we found that 70  of startups scaled prematurely along some dimension  While this number seemed high  this may go a long way towards explaining the 90  failure rate of startups    An entrepreneur quoted by the authors of the study said    Premature scaling is putting the cart before the proverbial horse As an entrepreneur there s always the temptation to grow the sales team at the first sign of revenue traction  but there is always the danger that this early traction is coming from the subset of the market that are early adopters and not the actual market itself  Additionally  too often I ve seen startups ramp up sales before they ve figured out the most efficient way to achieve profitability  A vicious cycle ensues wherein the more a company grows  the more it farther away from profitability it becomes    Viddy is often cited as an example of a company that died of premature scaling  For a period of time Viddy was able to use Facebook OpenGraph to grow its user base to millions of users before it ever had PMF  That mistake eventually meant the company was sold for very little and it faded away like the Cheshire Cat  Other business that suffered from premature scaling included Friendster  Orkut  and Digg  Groupon suffered from premature scaling but was able to pivot and save itself so far   By the way  Not everyone uses this premature scaling terminology  For example  if you look at this list of reasons why startups fail from CB Insights  premature scaling is not even listed but is perhaps buried in other categories      As an aside   Pivot Gone Bad  is a popular Country Western song written by a founder who wrote   My Co founder Left with my Husband and I m sure going to Miss Her     How to get there   In the early days of a product  don t focus on making it robust  Find product market fit first  then harden  Jeff Lawson  Again  the process is discovery based and experimentation is required  There is no value in hardening something that customers don t want to buy  Andreessen argues that  The product doesn t need to be great  it just has to basically work  And  the market doesn t care how good the team is  as long as the team can produce that viable product   If nearly everyone at the business is focused on trying to fulfill product demand instead of  siting around  trying to dream up new feature to create demand  there is almost certainly PMF   but the reverse is not the case   PMF is not a magic elixir  It signifies an important milestone that is necessary but not sufficient for success  Once a company has PMF it still must find a sustainable growth model and create a moat against competitors and so on  What PMF does do is help prevent businesses from spending money trying to grow a business  often inorganically  in a way that is doomed to fail      In general  hiring before you get product market fit slows you down  and hiring after you get product market fit speeds you up  Until you get product market fit  you want to a  live as long as possible and b  iterate as quickly as possible   Sam Altman    What Altman is saying is reflected in what co founder Jessica Livingston calls the Y Combinator motto   make something that people want  If you create something and no one uses it  you re dead  Nothing else you do is going to matter if people don t like your product    Andreessen argues that the life of any startup can be divided into two parts  before product market fit  what he calls BPMF  and after product market fit  APMF     When you are BPMF  focus obsessively on getting to product market fit  Do whatever is required to get to product market fit  Including changing out people  rewriting your product  moving into a different market  telling customers no when you don t want to  telling customers yes when you don t want to  raising that fourth round of highly dilutive venture capital   whatever is required  When you get right down to it  you can ignore almost everything else  I m not suggesting that you do ignore everything else   just that judging from what I ve seen in successful startups  you can    Founders have to choose a market long before they have any idea whether they will reach product market fit   Chris Dixon  Some venture capitalists want to see product market fit before they invest and leave it to angels to do the investing pre product market fit  They would rather buy a business with product market fit than try to predict whether a founder will find it  Key as always is for the venture capitalist to let the founders do the heavy lifting   You do not want a venture capitalist who hire a dog and then tries to do the barking     The key point Dixon makes is that founders have control over this by thinking carefully about what they re trying to do and why  There is also founder market fit   Notes   Page 219 of The Lean Startup https   www

1142,training-dataset/product/667.txt,product,The Wrong and Right Way to Build an MVPA few years ago  a new subscription based music service came on the scene with a lofty goal  change the way the world streams music  The industry had been broken for decades  and the rise of free streaming and download services like Napster  Pandora and Spotify were only making the situation worse  Artists weren t getting paid fairly for their work  and fans wanted access to their favorite music without having to burn a hole in their wallets or listen to ads every three minutes   In October 2014  the platform launched in the US  UK and Canada amid huge anticipation  Backed by some of the biggest artists in the game  including Jay Z  Beyonce  Rihanna  Madonna and Kanye West  and packed with ad free  high quality  exclusive content fans were craving  Tidal was poised to start a revolution   But the revolution never came   Over two years later  Tidal is struggling to stay alive  let alone change the industry as it promised  Even the most diehard music lovers  reviewers and the artists themselves are calling it quits  With subscriptions still sitting at a fraction of Apple Music s and Spotify s member base  and its third CEO taking office within an 8 month period  Tidal needs to make some major changes or face the music   What happened  Why hasn t Tidal taken off  What s holding it back   While there are tons of reasons it may be doomed to fail  the core of the problem may lie in its flawed MVP   The Problem with MVPs  The idea of a minimum viable product  MVP  was first coined by Frank Robinson  then popularized by Steve Blank s Customer Development methodology in the 1990s and Eric Ries  Lean Startup movement in the early 2000s  Ries defined an MVP as a phase of the product discovery process   the version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort    This concept caught on with designers and developers  especially as the tech industry boomed and the barriers to product development lowered  It gave product designers a framework for getting new products to market quickly  Developers and marketers also loved being able to ship a stripped down product  test it with real customers and measure its success in the marketplace without building a fully baked solution   Perhaps the problem is that MVP was defined incorrectly in the first place  Instead of a  Minimum Viable Product   we believe in the  Minimum Valuable Product   one that has the fewest features necessary to solve the primary problem for your primary market   As the industry embraced the concept of an MVP  they started to reap the benefits of saving time and money  and getting feedback quickly  But over time  a new problem has emerged  We ve misunderstood the definition and intent of an MVP   Now  many designers  developers and product managers use the MVP as an excuse to be lazy  They cut corners  remove features and sacrifice the user experience in the name of  staying lean  and  shipping    Perhaps the problem is that MVP was defined incorrectly in the first place  Instead of a  Minimum Viable Product   we believe in the  Minimum Valuable Product   one that has the fewest features necessary to solve the primary problem for your primary market   The Real MVP  A Minimum Valuable Product has a few key characteristics   Your product must solve at least one real problem  for one real audience  in one unique way  Otherwise  there s no reason for the user to react  feel invested  do business with you or give you their feedback   After all  an MVP is just an experiment  As a product designer or developer  you re essentially doing usability testing to see if your hypothesis is accurate  If even one of the four characteristics above is missing  the test results will be skewed  leading to biased decisions and potential product failure   Your product must solve at least one real problem  for one real audience  in one unique way   It s also crucial to constrain the MVP timeline  As people who like to  tinker  by nature  designers and developers could iterate forever  but customer feedback is like currency  Every day you re not on the market is money lost on product discovery and development instead of gathering input   Decisions  Decisions  Prioritizing What s In and What s Out  The common misconception is that an MVP is all about stripping down a product to ship it as quickly and cheaply as possible  What about this feature or that one  Gone  UX design  No time for that  barely functional will do  The code  Just do it fast  and you can clean it up later   Rather than helping products succeed  this is exactly how they fail  The most effective MVPs still maintain a high standard of quality when it comes to code  design  UX and content  They simply limit the scope   To start determining your minimum valuable product  consider these questions and exercises   The most effective MVPs still maintain a high standard of quality when it comes to code  design  UX and content  They simply limit the scope   Target Market  Defining your target market is the first place to start during product discovery  There are tons of people you could help  but this market contains the people you most want and are equipped to help  To start honing in on your target market  ask yourself and your team   Who could we help   What do those people have in common   demographics  motivations  values  etc    What are some of the problems or pain points they experience   Which segments aren t being targeted or aren t having their problems solved by our competitors or the current solution they re using   Which segments could we impact most  given our current skill set   Which segments would be the easiest to help   Is this a big enough market to make a difference   Are they easily accessible   Can they afford a solution to their problems   Do we know enough about them to meet their needs   Job to be Done  Whether you re iterating on an existing product or creating a completely new solution  it must do the one job your users are  hiring  it to do  The  job to be done   JTBD  could be a task the user wants to complete or the higher purpose  emotional  social  personal  etc   that motivates them to buy your product   Pinpointing your product s JTBD involves   Identifying your focus market  see  Target Market  above Identifying the jobs customers are trying to get done Creating job statements Prioritizing the JTBD opportunities  Problem Statement  To have a successful MVP  you must hone in on at least one primary job your target market can hire your product to do  Having a defined purpose  set of core values and vision also helps focus your team s efforts and design a more meaningful experience  Consider these questions   Why are you solving this problem and not something else   What gets you excited to work on this problem   What difference are you trying to make in the world   What type of experience are you trying to create for your users   What kind of company culture do you want to develop for your team   If your company were receiving a lifetime achievement award in 50 years  what would the award be for   To summarize all of these elements  your target market  JTBD  purpose  etc   into one succinct and usable phrase  develop a problem statement that your team can use as a North Star throughout the development and product management process   User Stories  With a problem statement in hand  your team will probably have dozens   maybe even hundreds   of ideas for potential features that could be included in your MVP  To prioritize those features and decide what stays and what goes  try this User Stories exercise     On a Post It Note  write down one task you want users to be able to complete with your product  Put it on a wall or whiteboard  Repeat step  1 until you have an exhaustive list of features that you want your users to be able to do at some point in the future  Group the Post Its by theme or category  Prioritize them from most important to least important to the user  The most important features become your  A stories   This group also represents the least amount of stories needed to deliver a distinct  well designed experience that adds value and accomplishes the main job to be done   As a side benefit  now you have a huge backlog of future features to revisit as you move into product management   If you re having a hard time prioritizing  try assigning each story a numerical ranking from 1 5 so you can look at the numbers objectively   Can We Launch   Throughout the product discovery  design and development process  new features and ideas are bound to come up  You can use your problem statement and User Stories exercise to evaluate and prioritize those feature requests  but when all else fails  ask one critical question    Can we launch without this feature    Keep in mind this question should be answered from the user s perspective  not a developer s or designer s point of view  What is minimally valuable for the user  If we launch without this feature  will we still be able to solve their primary problem   If the answer is  yes   be ruthless and move the feature to the backlog  If the answer is no  it s time to evaluate what it will take to add it  Will it cause you to go over budget  Does it fit within the current timeline  This is where hard decisions   and successful projects   are made or broken   When all else fails  ask one critical question   Can we launch without this feature    When the Going Gets Tough  the Tough Get Creative  Like any project  MVPs rarely go as planned  The work takes longer than expected the budget gets cut or spent it other areas the executives don t approve the full project   There are always going to be new reasons to postpone launch or pivot  so the key is to get creative and find ways to make it happen  Here are a few of the ways we ve seen companies tackle these common challenges and go on to achieve great things   Problem  Timeline  Solution  Reduce automation   Many apps and products rely on automation to streamline an existing process and save their users time  However  this automation takes time and resources to build   Sometimes  it s ok to include features in your MVP that don t scale  It may seem counterintuitive  but continuing to complete a process manually behind the scenes  while making it seem automated to your users  still adds value without incurring additional development time and expenses   Sometimes  it s ok to include features in your MVP that don t scale   For example  many products pull in a bunch of data  analyze it and deliver reports to their users that make the information easier to view and understand  Ideally  this process would be automated  But does it have to be at first  Nope   Instead  your product could have the user import or add their data  then show them a screen that says   Your report will arrive in your inbox in the next 12 hours   It seems like magic is happening behind the scenes  when in reality your team could be manually completing the process on the back end  It appears automatic to the user  but it s not   If the concepts works  you can truly automate the process in V2 or V3  but in the meantime  you re still providing value to your users and gaining meaningful feedback from your customers   That feedback might even change the way you automate the process in V2 or V3    Problem  Lack of support or resources  Solution  Spin off an R   D team   Some of the most successful products and brands in history  like the Mac and some of Nike s shoes  started as a skunkworks project  If you re trying to work around departmental resource constraints  consider spinning off a separate Research   Development Team  who can dedicate separate buckets of time and budget to innovation instead of product management   Just be sure that this team doesn t become siloed from the rest of the company  Their work needs to be guided by same problem statement and user research  and their findings should be shared with other teams to maximize usefulness    If you re trying to work around departmental resource constraints  consider spinning off a separate Research   Development Team   Problem  Budget  Solution  Consider an alternative MVP   Budget is often the biggest concern for a new product  In addition to the suggestions above  consider whether there s a completely different way to prove your concept without even building a product at all  That way  you can show its potential value  gain buy in and earn budget for a more full featured MVP   Consider whether there s a completely different way to prove your concept without even building a product at all   That s what Mattermark did  Initially  they wanted to solve a specific problem   How can we help venture capitalists and investors get better deal intelligence to inform their investment decisions    Since launching in 2012  they ve built a full fledged software product  However  Mattermark didn t even start as a product  First  it was a blog about the startup investment scene  Then  it gained enough popularity to evolve into a spreadsheet that tracked company Growth Scores  location  total funding and more  before the team finally had enough momentum and budget to build the app   How might you channel your inner Mattermark  test your hypothesis and solve your target market s main pain point without building a product at all   Is Your Product Viable or Valuable   As brands like Tidal have experienced firsthand  creating a successful MVP is less about building a product that makes a big splash right out of the gate  and more about doing one small thing really well  If they can refocus on solving one key problem and reinforce the bottom rungs of the Design Success Ladder  functionality  usability and comfort   perhaps the tides will turn   Until then  consider what your team can learn from cautionary tales like Tidal  as well as role models like Mattermark  The more we all shift from a mindset of viability to value  the more successful our businesses   and our users   will be,"[1142 627 23 544 1253 642 80 431 328 1417 1134]"
1147,training-dataset/product/1365.txt,product,Lean   Research   Success  An Interview with Tomer Sharon There s no doubt that personal pain signals there s an opportunity to solve a problem  Many entrepreneurs are sure they have a problem worth solving due to their own personal experience  But  they often fail to recognize that an almost tangible  fact  in their mind is just an assumption that should be tested  validated  or most likely  invalidated    So begins Tomer Sharon s book Validating Product Ideas Through Lean User Research  In it  he brings us statistics on failed and successful enterprises  explanations of the rationale behind problem solving and the value of research  and best of all  step by step instructions for testing and validating what the people want   Interested in learning more about validating your product ideas  Read on for some valuable behind the scenes advice from Tomer  and a chance to win a free copy of the book   Thanks for speaking with us  Tomer  We re fascinated by this whole concept of lean research  We noticed you reference  The Lean Startup  a few times throughout the book  How did your work build off Eric Ries s  Is lean user research always a part of a lean startup  and vice versa   I first heard about Eric and his ideas in 2011  When I interviewed Eric in person  I told him how happy I was with the success of his approach and the attention it was getting  The reason is that if you carefully listen to Eric or read his book  you can very quickly notice that a lot of what he is talking about focuses on design and user experience  Practices and techniques we UX people have been preaching about for decades with partial success  The key to the attention The Lean Startup is getting  in my humble opinion  is that it uses plain language many business people understand  I think we have been using terminology that was hard to connect with  This is why  for example  I scanned my new book and made sure it uses plain language and does not have any UX jargon  Eric Ries and Steve Blank were excited with my ideas about lean user research since they knew many companies and individuals who acknowledge the importance of validated learning need guidance on how to do that specifically  This is where I and my book come to play  I provide very specific how to instructions for readers who want to learn from their audience  or potential audience  to validate or invalidate their ideas   What are the best successes you ve seen come out of lean user research   To me  the best success I ve seen is that people stop talking about how user research is important and actually get up from their seat  take action  and do it  Startup founders  product managers  engineers  People who have never done research realize it is something they can do on their own  quickly and effectively  Many of these have been contacting me and telling me about how practicing lean research has changed their work  made them be more honest about what they do  and how they are now much more confident about the startup  product  and process   Two of the big questions you ask are  do people need  the product    and  do people want it   You identify smart phones as something people needed  though they didn t know that until they used it  How do you differentiate between people s needs and wants  Why does it matter   A need is a necessity arising from a problem  while a want is what people think they need  What people need is a critical question to ask when you build products  The question is important because of the risk it entails  Many product development teams tend to ask themselves if they can build a product rather than asking if they should  On the other hand   What people want   can be perceived as a critical question to get an answer to  however  it is not really a question about design and user experience of products  but rather one that concerns marketing them  It is important for understanding and learning about the state of mind of a target audience after it is exposed to the product or some kind of communication about it  What people need is very different than what they want  When you ask people what they need  they answer what they want  To uncover true needs  one must observe and track human behavior rather than asking about it   What are the biggest risks for product managers and startup founders as they delve into user research   Imagine they do research by just talking with customers  Talking with people is not research  Research is not rocket science yet it has some rigor to it  Not act on results because they are unexpected  unintuitive  or surprising  Use wrong method to answer great research questions  For example  use a survey to figure out if customer would use a product or feature  Bias participants with questions  study location  or body language  Focus on identifying  missing  product features rather than uncovering true user needs  The five biggest risks are   How do you recommend product managers and startup founders without user research experience move deeper into the field,"[1147 859 328 642 151 1142 378 1213 427 850 222]"
1160,training-dataset/product/562.txt,product,Using Pricing to Inform Your Roadmap73 Flares 73 Flares    We often think of pricing as something to do right before launching a new product  Maybe it gets a little thought during development  but it isn t urgent  Now that we re approaching launch though  we need a price   Or  sometimes we schedule a pricing meeting to decide whether to change our existing price or  albeit rarely  we schedule a meeting to discuss whether to change our pricing model   Unfortunately  these pricing conversations occur too late in the process  To create more profitable products and product portfolios  we must incorporate pricing concepts from the outset   More profitable products  Of course  you want buyers to choose your product instead of your competitor s product  So you need to know how your buyers decide between the alternatives   Price is almost always a factor in such decision making  If your product is more expensive than your competitor s product  people will only buy it if it offers more  But more what  That s what you need to figure out because every time your buyer decides between you and a competitor  this is how they make the decision  Which one costs more  And is it worth it   Is it worth it  is all about differentiation   You must find out what buyers are willing to pay for that your competitors don t have  then put that in your product  This is differentiation that is extremely valuable   As a product manager  you have a long list of features to build or market problems to solve  You need to prioritise them  One factor should be willingness to pay  How much more would buyers pay for this feature or solution  Hence  the most valuable differentiators should come earliest on your roadmap   More profitable product portfolios  So you now know that once you decide which product to build  you have to build in valuable differentiation  But how do you decide which product to build   Companies rarely launch new products in new markets  So your next product will probably be targeted at your current markets and maybe at even your current market segments  You know these buyers and users well  You also know what unsolved problems they have  You are in essence building a product portfolio  multiple products targeted at the same market   There are two basic types of products in a portfolio  versions and add ons  You may have heard your economics professor call them substitutes and complements  Versions are the products your buyers are deciding among  Think good  better  best versions of a smartphone  Buyers tend to buy only one  Add ons are the options people buy in addition to the base product  Think accessories or apps for that smartphone   It is critical that we understand how people make decisions within our own product portfolio  That will drive us to more profit  Let s look a little more at versions and add ons and how they can influence our roadmaps   Versions  There are two powerful ways to use versions in your product portfolio  The first is to build different versions for specific market segments  Look across your current customers  Some probably derive more value from your product than others and would pay significantly more  but you couldn t charge more because you still wanted to sell to the other customers   If this is true   and it usually is   consider creating a different version of the product for this new market segment  For example  Evernote s premium version  which targets individuals  sells for  69 99 per year  Its business version costs  12 per user per month  or  144 per person annually  Of course  there are some differences between the products  but the main one is that each version targets specific market segments that have a different willingness to pay   The second powerful way to use versions is to build good  better and best versions  Too often  companies build base products with complex options and price books that are so confusing buyers can t decide  And confused shoppers don t buy  So once you identify the market segment  then create good  better and best versions for buyers in that segment   Put yourself in the mind of your buyer and how they make this decision   If they know exactly what they need  they buy that   If budget is their primary consideration  they buy good   If the product is just a small portion of their spending budget  they buy best   Everyone else   the vast majority   buy the one in the middle  better   Having three versions of your product helps you win more customers  First  having a good version allows you to attract customers who might not otherwise afford to buy  Next  you can nudge the purchase of most buyers into better  a more profitable product for you  Finally  customers who aren t price sensitive buy best   You should intentionally plan to build versions  both across market segments and within market segments  and the effort should influence the products and features on your roadmap   Add ons  Acquiring customers is challenging and expensive  So once you win a customer  you want to maximise their lifetime value  A great way to do this is through add ons   You can create options for your product that buyers will pay you for  Those options tend to have higher prices and hopefully higher margins because your customers are locked in  Think about why popcorn is so expensive at the cinema  once customers are inside the theatre  they don t have many other choices   Of course  it s important not to make this too complex  A good rule of thumb is to only create options or add ons for items that have significant value  i e  high willingness to pay  to a small portion of your market   Think about what more you can sell to your current customers now that they trust you  These solutions  like all good product ideas  should go on your roadmap   The most profitable products and product portfolios are created only after you understand pricing  Knowing how your buyers use price to make decisions is critical  Understanding how different buyers use price is also important  Once you internalise this  you ll find it informs your entire product roadmap  After all  pricing is much more than simply placing a number on a product,"[1160 1231 155 1332 703 367 1202 23 1268 80 1215]"
1164,training-dataset/product/860.txt,product,Common causes of churn and how to kill them with UXRegardless of what vertical you re in  customers purchase your software because they feel it will solve their problems  When someone cancels their subscription to your software  however  something has changed  Somewhere  somehow your product has failed to provide the value that customer was looking for   This disconnect resulting in the loss of customers and revenue is churn  public enemy number one in the eyes of product managers everywhere   Churn can make or break a business  growth and revenue  and ignoring its importance only adds fuel to the fire  However  measuring and understanding your churn rate can help you identify critical problems with your product early on  create opportunities for sustainable growth  and ultimately improve your customer s experience   Although we wish we could extinguish churn with just one bucket of water  it s not a one step process  Let s talk about how to diagnose problems causing churn and how to apply effective UX techniques to decrease your churn rate and increase customer satisfaction   Understanding churn  Before we jump in  it s important to understand churn and what it means for your busines its precise definition differs based on the metrics you re paying attention to  and your business model or payment structure   At its most basic  your churn rate is the number of customers who stop using your product during a given period of time  To calculate this  you look at the number of customers you ve lost versus the number of customers you started with  to give you a percentage  For example  if you started the month with 100 customers last quarter and you lost 3 customers by the end of it  your monthly churn rate is 3    Here are some additional resources that can bring you up to speed on calculating churn and some industry benchmarks you can use to compare your rate   Okay  enough with the basics here s how to tackle churn and start holding onto more of the customers you worked so hard to acquire in the first place   Combat churn with UX basics  Now that you understand how to calculate churn  let s talk about ways to combat it   A business s churn rate may signify that the company isn t serving its existing customers  and is instead solely focusing its attention and resources on getting new customers  The users notice a disintegrating level of support from the SaaS provider and become disengaged  This is a dangerous path that dooms both the business and its users  ultimately resulting in lost revenue   Building or enhancing your product with these UX design principles in mind greatly improves the likelihood of customer retention and a low churn rate   Ask why  Step one of making any UX decision  Ask your customers   Why   why did they stop using your product   By asking this critical question  you might find that your customer support was slow or that there s a new competitor luring customers away  You may even find that your customer s needs have changed and your product has lost its value  These are all insights that you can act on to improve your churn rate  Asking this simple  yet critical question also gives you the opportunity to offer incentives for churning customers to stay   Find those  aha  moments  One of the best ways to reduce churn is by increasing your product s value for your customer  early and often  Find ways to give your customers  aha  moments   which occur when they get to experience and understand your service s core functionality  your core value  Through user testing and user interviews  identify the most compelling features of your product and work to decrease the number of steps between signup and using the most awesome features  By helping customers experience the main value of your product as quickly as possible  you re increasing the likelihood they ll stick around  and may even see what else you have to offer   Encourage efficient behavior  Gather both qualitative and quantitative data to look at typical user task flows  their challenges and triggers  a cue that results in a reward   With user interviews  you can gather better insights directly from users on how they are completing tasks  what they find most useful  where they are having difficulties  or what tools or features they d like to see instead  With this information you can make iterations that will help the user get the most use and value from your product   Minimize difficulties that users face when they try to accomplish tasks and test on repeat users to monitor whether they perform repetitive tasks easier and quicker  Associate triggers with actions and rewards to help point users in the right direction   Get  em hooked  Much of the time  your customers stop using your product because they failed to form a habit of using it regularly  You can create a habit forming product by utilizing the Hook Model  a recurring process of evoking a positive emotional response in the user  which will psychologically persuade him or her to use the software more frequently  There are four phases of the Hook Model    Trigger  An external stimulus that activates a user s internal need    Action   which motivates an action that will lead to anticipation of a reward    Variable Reward   the size of that award is variable  so the user doesn t know what exactly they will get    Investment   but there is an opportunity for the user to receive more benefits or rewards from repeating the trigger action   This process gets users  hooked  to your product and is therefore more likely to continue using your product rather than churn  You can learn more about the Hook Model in a UX teardown we did of one of the most popular video games in history  Destiny   Turning a problem into an opportunity  While these UX principles provide a foundation for increased customer retention  you may be experiencing more specific problems leading to churn  In order to improve customer retention  you need to understand why exactly customers are leaving in the first place   These are some common reasons for high churn rate and how a focus on UX can solve the problem   Problem  1  Slow setup or poor utilization  When users aren t shown how to use a particular feature of your product  they re less likely to use it to its full capabilities  Survey data and analytical data can reveal specific issues within your product that frustrates your users or could lead to churn  Some red flags include upticks in support ticket volume  an unusually high amount of assistance requests  poor product reviews  and negative feedback on social media   Solution  Improve your onboarding flow  First  offer to assist users with the setup process  if there is one  Make sure you re also offering a user friendly and efficient product tour that explains the core benefits of the software and showcases unique and significant features for them to perform the tasks at hand get them to the  aha  moment as quickly as possible   Groove  a SaaS startup  recognized that users who had very short first sessions and users who had a difficult time performing tasks within its software were most likely to churn  so they decided to offer extra assistance specifically to them  They sent automated messages to those with short session times or longer than average task completion times to walk them through in more detail   The result  It worked they retained approximately 40 percent of the customers who read the emails   Problem  2  Poor customer service  It s not rocket science  Customers need to feel appreciated  supported  and rewarded in order to stick around  Research conducted by the US Small Business Administration and the US Chamber of Commerce pinpointed customer service as the number one reason why businesses lose customers   68  of customers leave because of they are upset with the treatment they ve received   If your process for support is falling short of customer expectations  this could be the reason you re losing people   Solution  Step it up a notch use research and analytics to identify specific issues within your customer service experience  You can also measure this with Net Promoter Score  NPS   NPS is calculated by asking your customers one question using a 0 10 scale  How likely are you to recommend us to a friend or colleague  A score of 9 10 means the customer is a loyal enthusiast  7 8 means they are satisfied but not enthusiastic and may be easily lured away  and 0 6 indicates an unhappy customer that is more likely to churn  If your NPS is low  start talking to your low rating former customers to figure out why   Increase the communication options for sales and customer support to include email  calling  online chat  and Twitter  Hire more people to answer phones or support tickets if need be  Make sure different email subscription levels are available so people can get the amount of emails that they want from your company  as well as a clear and easy unsubscribe process  Providing additional resources  such as how tos  FAQs  and videos about how to use your product should also alleviate customer frustrations and lower the amount of support tickets   Problem  3  Lack of customer engagement  If customers can t find the value in your software  then your company has either a  missed the mark somewhere with your features or b  forgotten to remind customers of valuable features  Looking at user engagement can provide a good indication for which it may be  Are they using the tool but not certain features  There could be certain features that your customers are looking for but not finding  or using but not utilizing to its fullest  Are they using the features but still churning anyway  You could be offering features that don t actually solve the pain of your customer and therefore are of low value to them   Solution  If you ve done your homework before creating your product  it s probably not that users don t want the features you re providing  Most likely it s that they are having trouble finding or utilizing the functionality properly  With some user testing you ll be able to understand where the disconnect is occurring  You may need to update your UI design by following best practices for information hierarchy  call to action button placement or contrast  etc  For instance  perhaps the most valuable function is buried in the menu  Help your customers out by giving the function more visibility in your menu or calling attention to it in a more obvious way   Similarly  you may need to update your content  Make sure that your product uses the language that your customers would expect  especially when naming features or functionalities  What you name a button or link can have a huge effect on its usability for the user  Let s say that you changed where that one important function is on your menu  but users are still having trouble  Changing the text label for that button can transform a usability dead end into one of the most used features   Decrease your churn  increase your revenue  Understanding why churn is happening and working to decrease and prevent it will ultimately lead to stronger growth  Gathering quantitative and qualitative data from surveys  studies  and analytics can expose weaknesses within software that causes customers to cancel  With data and UX design principles  companies can use their churn rate as a rallying cry to vastly improve their customer s experience and strengthen their product offerings   You worked hard to acquire those customers  With some investigation and thoughtful tweaks  you won t have to work as hard to keep them   This post was originally published on the Digital Telepathy blog,"[1164 126

1183,training-dataset/product/64.txt,product,7 Strategies to Choose the Best Features for Your ProductPrioritization is a hot topic for product teams  especially for those doing their 2015 product planning  Even the most seasoned product manager struggles with determining which features and initiatives to put on the roadmap  With so many opportunities competing for scarce resources  how to decide   With that in mind  I conducted a session at ProductCamp SoCal last month about product prioritization   Whether you re developing a new product or maintaining an existing product here are seven different techniques you can use to determine the best initiatives  In the end  the technique you choose isn t as important as the conversation your team has about the priorities  And even if you disagree about the specific prioritization  if you can get agreement on the criteria  you re ahead of the game   1  Value versus Complexity Quadrant  In the Value versus Complexity model you evaluate every opportunity based on its business value and its relative complexity to implement  Based on our conversations with product managers this is a common approach  and many product managers go through this assessment instinctively every day  The matrix is simple  The initiatives that have the highest value and the lowest effort will be the low hanging fruit for your roadmap     2  Weighted scoring  With weighted scoring you can use the Value versus Complexity model  but layer in scoring to arrive at an objective result  Based on dozens of interviews with product managers we arrived at this model for our prioritization model in ProductPlan   By using a scoring method to rank your strategic initiatives and major features  product managers can facilitate a more productive discussion about what to include on the product roadmap  While there are many inputs that ultimately go into a product decision  a scoring model can help the team have an objective conversation   A clear  objective scoring model can inform the initiatives you decide to include on your roadmap  and lend credibility to your product strategy  In ProductPlan  you can seamlessly drag approved initiatives from the Planning Board onto your roadmap   3  Kano Model  customer delight versus product function   With the Kano model product managers can look at potential features through the lens of the delight a feature provides customers versus the potential investment you make to improve the feature   There are some basic features that your product simply needs to have in order for you to sell your product in the market  You need to have these  threshold  features  but continuing to invest in them won t improve customer delight dramatically   There are some features  like performance  that give you a proportionate increase in customer satisfaction as you invest in them   Finally  there are some  excitement  features that you can invest in that will yield a disproportionate increase in customer delight  If you don t have these features  customers might not even miss them  but if you include them  and continue to invest in them you will create dramatic customer delight   4  Buy a Feature  This is an activity you can use with customers or stakeholders to prioritize a set of potential features  The approach is simple but fun  List out potential features and assign a  price  to each  based on a relative cost to develop it   Hand out a set amount of cash and then ask participants to buy the features  Some will place all their money on one particular feature they re passionate about  while others might spread their cash around the room  The result is your prioritized feature list   5  Opportunity Scoring  Opportunity scoring isa type of Gap Analysis that comes from Outcome Driven Innovation  Without getting too detailed  the idea is to measure and rank opportunities based on their importance versus customer satisfaction  To conduct opportunity scoring you ask customers to score the importance of each feature and then also score how satisfied they are currently with that feature  Your opportunities are those features that are highly important yet customers gave a low satisfaction score   6  Affinity Grouping  Affinity grouping can be a fun prioritization activity  I ve conducted affinity grouping sessions with product teams that are trying to understand what to build  The idea is simple  have everyone brainstorm opportunities on sticky notes  Then as a team  begin to group similar items together  and then name the groups  Finally  everyone on the team begins to vote on or rank the groups   7  Story Mapping  Story mapping is a personal favorite of mine  and is a great way to document the MVP by organizing and prioritizing user stories  The idea in a nutshell is that you first create task oriented story cards and group them into a workflow  You then arrange the cards in priority order for each group  The final step is to draw a line  often with tape  across all the stories to divide them into releases sprints  I m oversimplifying  so there are lot of great resources to learn more  including articles and presentations  Jeff Patton now has a new book about this topic as well   Suggestions for Prioritizing  Your good product management skills will come into play during the process  I have a few suggestions regardless of the prioritization method you choose   Approach prioritization as a team activity  not only is does it create buy in on the team  you get different perspectives  It s also a lot more fun   Limit the number of items you are prioritizing   focus on the biggest items rather than the details   Categorize and group initiatives together into strategic themes  for example   improving satisfaction  for a particular persona would be a good way to group    Before you begin prioritizing  it s helpful if you understand the customer value for each initiative  The customer value should be rooted in evidence that you ve gathered from customers rather than your opinions   Before you begin  have a rough estimate of cost  Even T shirt sizing of  small   medium  and  large  will be helpful during the process   Finally  here is the presentation from ProductCamp,"[1183 1253 1364 325 101 328 1142 1164 502 1417 508]"
1184,training-dataset/product/718.txt,product,The Product Manager vs  The Strategist   The Startup   MediumThe Product Manager vs  The Strategist  How the people behind the roles that shape your world think   Your life is curated   The coffee you re drinking  the videos you re streaming  and that pair of Converses you re wearing   all your choices were driven by what was available and desirable  But who put those options there  Who decided that Nestle should create an espresso machine  Who made Youtube a household name  Who told Nike to purchase Converse   Product managers  PMs  and strategists drive such decisions  and thus shape your world  Both choose which problems to solve and which goals to go after  Both turn grand visions into tangible goods and market realities   At the moment  their worlds are disparate  PMs and strategists see things through different lens and maintain often opposing priorities  But they re actually two halves of a functional whole  to address the range of challenges modern markets present  both perspectives are necessary to win and keep winning   Most companies value one or the other  and keep the two worlds separate  In such a system  PMs and strategists provide competing perspectives  rather than empower one another to create exponential wins for both customers and the business   To understand how the two can collaborate  we must first understand how the product manager and the strategist think   How do product and strategy relate   Product connects customer needs with business goals  to produce goods and services that people use and buy  enabling the company to compete  As a field  it has become significantly more important to effective competition within the past few decades  particularly as the tech industry has risen  The direction can come from the top  PMs execute on executives  visions  or from the bottom  PMs weave features into marketable stories    Strategy considers the external and internal landscape to identify market gaps and opportunities  enabling the company to compete  As a field  it s often held close to the executive team  The role is mature  but the nature of strategic work has changed significantly in past decades  competitive advantage has shifted from being the best in the world at a particular thing to being the most adaptable to evolving markets and customer needs   When the two come together  companies often find breakthrough successes  Perhaps one of the clearest recent examples of this is the Nespresso system  the product addressed a strong  mostly unmet  need for high quality but also high convenience espresso  while the strategy enabled Nestle to sustain growth through subscription sales and hardware licensing   To put it simply  both product and strategy aim to fulfill a company s why   Product begins with the what   Strategy begins with the how   So how does each role tend to think at each stage   Note the following is simplified for clarity  there are many exceptions  The definitions of both product management and strategy are fuzzy and ever evolving  so consider this a starting point to enable better collaboration  rather than a set of hard line distinctions   Breaking in to the market   Product managers find gaps of unmet needs using customer research  They identify problems with the strongest market impact by prioritising the list by highest pain or widest reach  For example  Youtube allowed customers to share and consume large video files by simultaneously downloading and watching them  aka streaming   rather than having to wait for the entire file to download first   a particularly important need given the speed of the 2005 Internet  Product managers pursue solutions to impactful customer problems  which then produce value for the business through direct or indirect sales   Strategists find gaps in the market via competitive analysis  They identify the biggest opportunities by a  considering what highly successful competitors are doing which they could do better  or b  what areas competitors might have missed which they could easily address  For example  Trader Joe s realised that rather than selling as a cheaper alternative  they could reframe products of their own label to be a marker of quality and relevance to the interests of their customers  Strategists determine which opportunities can produce maximum new customer and or business value   Breaking through to the top of the market   Product managers win by a  addressing important unmet needs  or b  addressing met needs better than all their competitors  to the point that they drive customers to switch products  Correspondingly  their company s business model is designed to win through sales  direct or indirect  that correlate with the success of the product  For example  the iPod  while not the first digital music player  introduced the Shuffle feature and was the first to display names of songs instead of filenames  creating a superior music listening experience  Product managers focus on a clever what      Strategists win by capturing opportunities in unique ways  They have figured out a  how to sell the same things cheaper  e g  through strategic partnerships or complementary revenue streams  or b  how to create new value from what they ve already got  e g  by addressing new markets   For example  Uber accomplished both of these simultaneously by realising they could provide cheaper taxi services by turning their customers into suppliers  via UberX  Strategists focus on a clever how   Scaling success   Product managers scale their solution by meeting the needs of wider audiences  As their products are adopted by more diverse customers  they adapt their products to these new customers  who have different needs  This is known as the Technology  or Product  Adoption Curve   Strategists scale their solution by improving their business model to undercut competitors and create new value  They might forge new partnerships to cut costs  identify new marketing channels by which to reach customers  or find new revenue streams for the same opportunities  A useful tool for identifying these opportunities is the Business Model Canvas   Maintaining a competitive advantage at the top of the market   Product managers continue to create new or complementary features and products to to address evolving customer needs  Once they ve solved one customer problem  they might unlock related or adjacent customer problems  For example  as Google became a dominant email provider with Gmail  the offer of a matching calendar  and eventually a suite of productivity apps  was a natural progression of user needs   As competitors catch up and markets reshape and customer expectations change  PMs evolve their products  continuously searching for today s most relevant needs  To advance  adaptability is key   As competitors catch up and markets reshape and customer expectations change  PMs evolve their products  continuously searching for today s most relevant needs  To advance  adaptability is key  Strategists continue to find new ways to create value for the business and for customers as competitors  markets  and customers change  For instance  once they ve created a set of strategic partnerships for one product  they might realise they could leverage this network to easily create another one  Amazon did this  for example  by turning their internal virtual server system   which was created to increase Amazon s retail efficiency   into an external product that acts as its own revenue stream  Amazon Web Services   As new competitors enter and markets grow or shrink and customer expectations change  strategists continuously search for new ways to gain the edge  To advance  flexibility is key   Reconciling product and strategy  Some companies  particularly within tech  have figured out how to leverage the best of both worlds   Facebook  for example  is widely believed to have originally won the market by creating exclusivity around social networks  a strategic decision rather than one that directly solved a need  But this exclusivity was created around real life networks  a decision which  knowingly or not  addressed a customer need by enabling people to use their real identities and create an online life that complemented  rather than adjuncted  their real lives  Fast forward a decade and Facebook is building drones to bring Internet access to remote areas  a strong customer need   addressing the strategic problem that they ve saturated their accessible markets  Facebook has arguably mastered the balance of product and strategy  crafting solutions that empower their business by solving problems for their customers   Amazon is  perhaps controversially  another elegant example of this balance   its commitment to passing profits back to customers in the form of low prices gives it a strategic advantage almost impossible to crack  even when competitors attempt to temporarily take on losses   and this business model only remains sustainable as long as it is a market leader  So Amazon has created a cycle in which  1  it takes the lowest profits  so 2  it has the lowest prices  so 3  it has the most customers  which 4  keeps it alive despite having lowest profits  Customers needs are met in the best way possible through a strategy that is incredibly difficult to replicate   These examples and the interplay between product and strategy that we see today is only the tip of the iceberg  Most modern companies still prefer or excel at one or the other  and the roles rarely speak  often lacking understanding or awareness of the other   Imagine how much more value we could create  to businesses and customers alike  if we changed that  More on how we got here at this post  and how product and strategy should play together in the next coming post,"[1184 881 101 635 716 1253 1215 328 650 549 1134]"
1188,training-dataset/product/1017.txt,product,3 Pillars of the Most Successful Tech Products3 Pillars of the Most Successful Tech Products  If you ve started a tech company to make a lot of money  chances are you re bad at math or simply delusional  Statistically speaking  your odds of a big time payday are somewhere between zero and almost zero         Ninety two percent of startups fail within three years  Only one percent of apps in the Apple App Store are financially successful  And even for the fortunate few companies that raise venture funding  seventy five percent will fail to generate a return on investors  capital   Why do some companies scale to millions of users while others wallow in obscurity  What explains the runaway success of a company like Facebook while a startup like Viddy  a mobile app for video  attracted millions of users and millions of dollars in financing  only to lose both   When it comes to startup success  there s never a magic bullet  Yet as the British statistician George Box once wrote   All models are wrong  but some are useful    Perhaps the hardest part about running a new business is knowing what to prioritize  There are hundreds of decisions to make  and keeping sight of what s important and what s not is a constant challenge  But when it comes to helping teams stay focused  I have found one model to be extremely useful  it s called the GEM framework  The origin story of the framework is uncertain but I ve heard a similar model was first used during the early days of LinkedIn   A company s job is to find a sustainable way to deliver value to customers  employees  and shareholders  To do this  the company must never lose sight of its GEM  its growth  engagement  and monetization         Growth  Growth is all about how a company finds new users or customers  Fundamentally  it s about getting the right message in front of people who need what you have  I call these messages  external triggers   External triggers are delivered through various channels  including television commercials  salespeople  emails  or word of mouth   Some external triggers  like one satisfied customer telling another about your product  cost you nothing  Others  like running ads on Google or buying billboards along the highway  can cost big bucks   There s nothing inherently better or worse about one external trigger versus another  What matters is whether the trigger fits your business  Viral growth is wonderful but difficult to engineer and sustain  Meanwhile  buying media can produce a steady stream of customer interest but can be expensive  The growth question to answer is   Are we getting better at drawing the attention of people who need our product   And quantifying the answer to that question means tracking the number of new users or customers over time as well as the cost of earning their attention   It s important to recognize that growth is a process and a practice  not an end state  Companies satisfied with their growth strategy are at risk of losing customers to their competitors  The Growth Hackers I know manically look for new channels and relentlessly test how many potential customers can be found and for what cost   Growth question   Are we getting better at drawing the attention of people who need our product    Growth metric  Number of new users or customers  and the cost of finding them   Engagement  With some products and services  customer engagement is naturally infrequent think of the way people buy real estate or book vacation travel  Other businesses require constant  habitual engagement to survive  Apps like Facebook  Slack  Salesforce  and Snapchat need to become a habit  or else they go out of business  If the service isn t used often  these products become less useful  and eventually customers never return   Retaining customers means keeping them engaged  whether they re checking in on an app or checking out of a purchase  Some businesses depend on repeat customer engagement more than others  But most critical for investors  founders  and employees is to understand what brings people back   To track engagement  companies should calculate the percentage of people using their product or service frequently enough to be classified as  retained   For some products it s once a year  for others it s once an hour  The question  Are we getting better at engaging people who need our product   is answered by calculating the growth in the percentage of retained customers   Engagement question   Are we getting better at engaging people who need our product    Engagement metric  Percentage of retained users or customers         Monetization  Finally  companies need to turn some of the value they create into cash or they go out of business  There are many ways to capture value  Companies can charge a subscription fee  sell a one time purchase  or create marketplaces where they take a share of the transaction between buyers and sellers   When it comes to monetization  the most crucial question is   Are we getting better at capturing the value we create   The metric here is profits  But it s essential not only to ask how the company is doing today  but also to understand how much untapped demand exists for the product  This is the only way to predict whether a company will be sustainable in the near term and to make bets on how big the company can get in the future   This is where people get  lucky  with startups  While skill  diligence  and process drive user growth and product engagement  predicting future markets is notoriously tough so much so that being smart can actually be a disadvantage   Smart people tend to try to predict future markets by reading industry reports  designing models  and running numbers  However  with access to similar information  people tend to come to similar conclusions  That s why being right isn t enough  Paradoxically  if you are right and everyone agrees with you  competitors will see the opportunity too  enter the market  and eat away at your profits   Therefore  when it comes to monetization over the long term  there s only one way to achieve it  you ve go to see a future market others don t  Next  if you can spot the big untapped market on the horizon  you ve got to  as Warren Buffett advises  protect it with  unbreachable  moats    There are only five ways to defend your market from competitors  economies of scale  network effects  regulatory protection  brand  and habit   Without a big unseen market and a way to hold on to it  future profits are no sure thing   Monetization question   Are we getting better at capturing the value we create    Monetization metric  Profit   A Necessary Trinity  Growth  engagement  and monetization are interlinked  and each is insufficient on its own   The most highly engaging  habit forming product will fail if it s used only by a small number of people who pay too little for the service  The overwhelming majority of apps in the App Store are never found by a critical mass because the companies behind them have failed to find a way to profitably draw users  attention   Similarly  an amazing growth strategy using the latest viral hacks is pointless without a way to retain and profit from the growth  Viddy  the video sharing service and Snapchat predecessor  shocked Silicon Valley in the spring of 2012 by acquiring nearly three million users in a month  But shortly after investors ploughed  30 million into the company  it became clear the app was a leaky bucket that could not retain its users   Finally  huge market potential is useless without a way to profitably reach and engage customers  For example  music streaming services like Spotify and Pandora are a daily habit for millions of people  but if song owners manage to extract all the value by imposing stricter copyright terms  they have the power to destroy the streaming services   Of course  businesses have to worry about all sorts of other things  see Alex Osterwalder s Business Model Canvas for a more detailed analysis   But thinking through the GEM framework is extremely effective for keeping teams on track   As Tomasz Tunguz  a partner at Redpoint Ventures  told me  these three criteria  help make sure the team is allocating resources correctly   When it comes to monitoring and regularly communicating what matters  the GEM

1191,training-dataset/business/1061.txt,business,Amazon s Friction Killing Tactics To Make Products More SeamlessThe day before Kintan Brahmbhatt s 10th birthday  he stayed up late  gripped with excitement  so he could open his presents  After tearing off the wrapping on one package  he was overjoyed to find a bright red  remote controlled toy car inside  Brahmbhatt placed the car on the floor  With a smile on his face  he inched the joystick forward   The race car didn t move   As it turned out  the toy didn t come with batteries  nor were there any in the house  At that hour  there was no way to get them  Where Brahmbhatt lived  there were no stores open late  Deflated and disappointed  he went to bed   This was Brahmbhatt s earliest brush with what he calls friction   anything that gets in the way of a customer and a task  Put another way  it s any obstacle that prevents a user from trying or using a product or service  Since the failed spin on the race car  Brahmbhatt s built a career based on taking friction out of technology  often in remarkably innovative ways  At Amazon  he s helped develop and define the product strategy behind Amazon Music subscription services and music on Alexa  the voice recognition technology behind the company s smart speaker  Echo  He also previously headed the company s IMDb Everywhere initiative  which produced the  X Ray  feature that automatically clues viewers into the names of the actors in any given scene  Before that  he helped build what became Skype for Business at Microsoft   In this exclusive interview  Brahmbhatt takes us through how to detect and anticipate points of friction through monitoring steps in a customer s journey with your product  He shares the three stages of the product experience where customers are most vulnerable to experiencing friction  Brahmbhatt also walks through strategies to reduce friction  or  if it s unavoidable  how to mask it   Defining Friction  Friction can manifest in a number of ways  ranging from overly complicated sign up procedures to difficult to navigate menus  According to Brahmbhatt  there are three types of friction   Friction due to unfamiliarity  A customer s first time experience with your product automatically contains friction when they don t know how to use it  This is one of the biggest hurdles to get over when launching a new product   Friction by design  There are times when you have to intentionally build friction into a product  If your product has a learning curve  you ll have to design that experience thoughtfully   Friction due to misalignment with human behavior  Here s where design can come back to bite you  Poorly placed app controls  failing to anticipate how consumers will use the product and badly designed navigational tools will cause this   While the first two types of friction are easier to anticipate and control  the third category includes cases that are unintentional or emerge unexpectedly   I got a mega shock when we launched music services on Alexa  Customers were trying to find music in ways none of us had ever imagined  We d been prepared for people making specific song requests   Brahmbhatt says   But the problem with new releases is that people don t necessarily know the name of every song  The voice commands that customers asked Alexa were more conversational than we d expected  It was   Play the latest single by Adele  or  Play the new album by Adele   Or for Sia s  Chandelier   they d ask for it by the lyric    Play one two three by Sia     As a product line   or a music service   evolves  more points of friction can arise   Customers would say  skip  after asking for a U2 song   Alexa would cue up the band s latest tune  when the listener really wanted to hear music from the 1980s  We were missing the point in addressing the customer s intent  There was so much innate friction in the customer s ability to get the music they wanted to get   Brahmbhatt says   The goal here is really about anticipating those friction points in the customer s mind   and if you can t  then finding and alleviating them quickly  This isn t easy  You have to study failure points   for us  it was the number of customer requests that were not fulfilled  or the number of songs cued up that were skipped    Despite best efforts to anticipate and address friction  know that there will be times you don t find out about a point of friction until it s too late for a customer  In Brahmbhatt s early days working on digital medical records project Securamed  an early user traveled to Mexico on vacation and found herself in need of medical attention  Unfortunately  Securamed stored records in English only  and her Spanish speaking doctor was unable to use them  It was an example of unintentional friction   which you frequently see in new products  The team later added multi lingual capabilities  and use of the product climbed as a SARS outbreak hit Asia   When building products  you re always either removing  adding or masking friction   Where Friction Hides  So how do you catch friction before it manifests  First  know where to find it  This is where knowing your customer s journey comes in  You ll want to hone in on the specifics  but for any product  there are three stages to how a customer interacts with your company s offering   Before first contact  This is the easiest one to spot   At the very beginning of your product s life  the customer isn t aware it even exists  Your goal is to convert them from being unaware to being interested  It s all about anything you can do to remove the friction that s preventing your ideal customer from knowing you re out there   Brahmbhatt says   You can measure awareness by looking at your market segment share and other leading indicators  like press and social media mentions  When the press is writing about your industry  are they mentioning your product or service  Look at web and app store traffic  installs  number of reviews and the quality and sentiment of the reviews  Work with your marketing team on improving these metrics    Sign up   one  transition  task  Once someone is aware of your product  more potential for friction enters the picture   As the user moves along in the journey of your product  they go from being interested to being a customer  or at least somebody who s tried it at least once  You want them to sign up and then perform one meaningful task   Brahmbhatt says   So often startups lean on how many signups they ve had  but if customers don t engage with it in some meaningful and measurable way  they re unlikely to return  For example  if it s a healthcare app  maybe the goal is for the user to sign up and book their first doctor s appointment  This task sets expectations for a future engagement    How to choose your  transition  task   You don t want it to be too complex  Focus on the behavior that you want the customer to repeat   Brahmbhatt says   Pick the action that helps a user repeat the task over and over again  In the case of a healthcare app  it s booking an appointment or asking a question to the physician  In banking  it s signing in to check your balance for the first time  In music  it s about playing the first song   so that you can get suggestions for the next song    First moment of delight  Now that people are engaged  this is your opportunity to impress them   This is where you transform someone from being an occasional user to being a fanatic customer  To add the delight factor  look for counterintuitive patterns in your data  Look for failed use cases that you would have expected to succeed  With Alexa  we saw that customers  demeanor became more casual when it came to music   Brahmbhatt says   Now that people are engaged  this your opportunity to impress them  We made it so that it would play music inspired by what they d recently listened to  Or in December  it would contextually cue up holiday music  When Alexa responded to these casual voice commands and played music that customers loved  they were delighted and were more likely to come back and use it again    Indifference generates the highest friction for new products   Power Up Three Listening Posts  No one would argue with the advice that one should listen to their customers  But when and where can be harder to determine  because ultimately you re trying to intercept key moments that illustrate human behavior  Once you do  your goal is to conform to it or change it   First I ll say that it s very hard to change human behavior  Unless it s absolutely necessary  I try to avoid changing behavior on day one  It can be a gradual journey where it takes days or even months depending on the type of behavior   Brahmbhatt says   However  it s doable  You have to observe existing human behavior and map your products to it    According to Brahmbhatt  there are three types of listening posts   Natural Habitat  Think the Nature Channel  There are a myriad of tools that allow product teams to monitor customers in app  but don t neglect getting in the field  That can mean getting invites into offices  retail stores or living rooms   all depending on your target customers   Shadow your customers  It s inexpensive and very easily doable by small start ups  You don t really need to observe 1 000 people   five or so will do   says Brahmbhatt   While researching  we d watch how people read books or how families listen to music  We d see customers rewind a song by a few seconds to listen to a particular lyric  or using X Ray to jump to a particular scene to see Alfred Hitchcock s cameo  These trends were once counterintuitive to us  Observing your customers while they use your product gives you a glimpse into the role your product plays in their life  and there s a treasure trove of information there    Mentions and Reviews  Feedback can be explicitly expressed  like app reviews  social media mentions and customer emails  but it can also be something you tease out of the data   Examine your usage metrics and dig for atypical trends  Pay particular attention to high frequency actions and recurring patterns  You might find that people gravitate to a certain part of your app  or are repeat buyers of certain products   Brahmbhatt says   As we were figuring out how to enable customers to buy something via voice  we realized that some customers may need to look at a picture or read a detailed description before making the final decision  We found out that if a customer had bought a product before  his anxiety about buying it again is reduced dramatically  Now  if I ask Alexa to buy toilet paper  she ll ask me if I want the same 36 pack of Cottonelle I bought last time  All I need to say is yes  and the product shows up at my doorstep    The Industry Standard  Find the expectation that s been set in your customers  minds for existing products and services   That bar is the current path of least resistance  It could be the search bar always being on top  or the menu being on the left   that s what your customer s muscle memory will gravitate towards  You  of course  also want to know about larger trends industry wide  so that you can offer a service that s competitive   Brahmbhatt says   Friction plays a pivotal role in the launch of a new product  Customers must perceive the value of your product to be very high  and the corresponding effort to try it out has to be very low  The next best alternative to your customer trying your product is to do nothing at all    Always migrate your audience to the path of least resistance   Three Steps to Eliminate Friction  Think about friction as the simplest way for your user to get where she wants to go   This is what we re trained to do as human beings   take the easiest route  Reducing friction is all about creating a path of least resistance   says Brahmbhatt   But that doesn t mean you re always changing customer behavior  You re splintering off from it  To do so  ask  what s the closest path to existing behavior that you can create  How can you get a user to complete a task in a more efficient way  but which still maps with her existing behavior    These are the steps Brahmbhatt recommends for cutting friction from your product   Reduce anxiety  Two factors cause anxiety  decisions and loss  The Amazon Music team faced both when music began to migrate from physical CDs to digital   Customers were stressed out about choosing whether they should buy a CD or vinyl  or purchase an mp3 instead  It created cognitive overhead and friction in the act of listening to music  People couldn t decide  and having to added anxiety   Brahmbhatt said   There also was the fear of loss  Some of our customers had purchased CDs that were worth hundreds of dollars since 1998  Should they just lose it in the migration to digital  They could rip the CD  but that would take a lot time and effort  So we launched AutoRip  which automatically gave customers MP3 versions of CDs and vinyls they d purchased  Customers were thrilled  and we eliminated two causes of anxiety  decisions and loss   with one product launch    Remove avoidable steps  When designing your product  ask yourself if you need the customer to make a decision   Make a list of all decisions a customer needs to make in order to complete a task in your product  Then question each one  For example  in a healthcare app  since your home address is already in there  the app could automatically select a clinic based on proximity to your location  That takes the friction and anxiety of choice out of the process   Brahmbhatt says   When setting up a music player  a customer could choose the streaming bitrate   a measure of audio quality   of up to 256 kilobytes per second  kbps   We asked ourselves two questions   first  if the customer absolutely needed to make that decision or whether we could pre select it for the user  To reduce cognitive load  rather than calling it 256 kbps  we called it  high   We offered options that were easy to understand   low  medium  high and then added a pre selected choice of  auto   You as a customer didn t need to worry about making that decision  It was already taken care of for you    Another way to get at avoidable steps is to ask yourself these questions  in this order   How many decisions are between a customer and completing a task   Are each of these decisions absolutely necessary   If so  can you make the decision for the customer by pre selecting an option   If not  and the customer absolutely needs to make that decision  how can you simplify the decision process   If there are multiple decisions  could you combine them into one decision  Can you present the most important decision first to the customer   How can you preserve the decision once it s been made so that you don t have to ask the customer again in the future   Mitigate context switching  Context switching often happens when a customer must navigate away from your app or site to complete a task  It s the point at which your customer will abandon your product   To solve this  create points where customers don t have to switch contexts  For instance  Buffer and Pocket have Chrome extensions that allow you to operate their services from your web browser  and they do it beautifully  Look at some of the most successful apps out there  The check in button on Foursquare was always apparent no matter where you navigated in the early versions of the app   Brahmbhatt says   Allow customers to easily switch back and forth between the primary task   in Foursquare  that was checking in   and the secondary task  which was browsing restaurants  In early days of Kindle  we noticed that some customers would leave the book to look up words in the dictionary  so the team built that function into the Kindle app  Along similar lines  customers would also navigate away from movies to look up actors on IMDb  We addressed that by allowing them to easily find out the actor on the screen while watching a movie or a TV show on Amazon video  Instead of teaching customers a new UI action  we automatically showed names of the actors on screen whenever the user hit pause while watching the video    Sometimes there s no way to avoid context switching   If you absolutely have to do it  then do it gracefully  When customers switch between listening to music on their computer versus the Echo at home  we make it easy to recall recently played songs  Audible also syncs seamlessly with the Kindle  so that you can pick up an ebook from the same spot where you left off in the audiobook   Brahmbhatt says   The top two issues around context switching are continuity and recall  Customers want to be able to recall what they did earlier   a movie they watched  a song they played  They also want continuity  so letting the customers pick up from where they left off is critical    Kintan Brahmbhatt  How To Mask Friction  Friction is unavoidable in some cases   If there s just no way to avoid it  mask it  When we launched AutoRip  the app would take a few seconds to load the large music collection for customers who had purchased thousands of songs in the past  While it loaded  instead of showing a simple progress bar or a spinner  we masked that moment of pause by greeting the customer with a useful welcome message to explain the service   Brahmbhatt says   Friction may be added by design to produce later benefits   For subscription services  it is often effective to place the friction upfront by requiring the credit card on file so there s no extra step needed at the end of the trial in order to subscribe  Host verification on Airbnb  or presenting terms and conditions are other examples where friction is introduced by design in the customer journey  A little friction can also lead to increased usage and loyalty  For instance  customers who up or down vote a song on a radio station feel more invested in the station they ve helped curate   Brahmbhatt says   If they ve done some work to inform their experience  it increases the likelihood of repeat usage  Customers feel they were involved in building something that they enjoy  It s important to pick the right place to go when you re adding friction intentionally  Identify the most commonly repeated actions and get new customers to perform the first iteration of those actions  Playlist creation is an example of this  Customers who create a playlist by investing some effort in the music app end up using the app more frequently    Add friction to create a sense of ownership   carefully  The goal isn t for the user to do a task  but to do it in the most satisfying way   Striving for a More Frictionless World  Friction can be a powerful deterrent between a customer and your product  It s typically introduced by a lack of familiarity or misalignment with human behavior  Start to combat it by mapping the three stages of friction  before the first contact  the signup process   during which you want the customer to complete one task   and the first moment of delight  Then set up listening posts for observing your customers and teasing counterintuitive insights out of the data to discover where friction is occurring  Finally  cut friction by reducing customer anxiety  cutting avoidable steps and preventing context switching    A customer s experience with your product should be smooth and seamless  Start with the customers and work backwards  Listen to and observe your customers closely  Find the potholes and bumps in the road  Where do they get slowed down or tripped up   Brahmbhatt asks   Carve out the path of least resistance for your customer  Always stay true to what ll take friction out of the process   products that falter are often ones where this has been neglected  It takes effort  but it s worth it  And it s not always as hard as you might think  Sometimes all that stands between your product and a moment of delight is a pair of batteries    Photography by Bonnie Rae Mills,"[1191 549 365 494 328 1164 888 322 881 705 1142]"

deal on your house  you ll learn 42 tricks to make your price seem lower   PDF Bonus  This article is 9 368 words  Click to   This article is 9 368 words  Click to download the full PDF so that you can reference it later   Step 1   Influence Their Perception   All our knowledge has its origin in our perceptions     Leonardo da Vinci  Nothing in this world has concrete meaning  At the end of the day  price is merely a perception  Nothing more  Nothing less   In this section  you ll learn pricing techniques that will subconsciously influence people to perceive your price to be lower   all without changing the inherent magnitude   But first you need to understand how people evaluate prices   Get access to the full video when you subscribe to the blog  Prime a Small Magnitude  You can influence people s memory for your price  When people compare your price to a reference price  you can influence them to pull a lower price into that comparison   Why would people do that  Because our brain is lazy  Adaval and Monroe  2002  explain that     price information about a product is unlikely to be coded into memory in terms of exact numerical digits but  rather  is coded spontaneously in more general magnitude terms  e g    low    high    Thus the numerical price is susceptible to the influence of its original context when people attempt to reconstruct it later    pp  585   With such a hazy memory  you can influence people to recall a smaller magnitude  How  Here are a some useful tactics   Tactic 1  Reduce the Left Digit By One  For the past few decades  marketers have used charm pricing   prices that end in 9  99  or 95   And the results speak for themselves  Check out Gumroad s sales   When people see those positive results  they often credit the 9 s in the price  However  there s another culprit responsible  the left digit   Charm pricing is most effective when the left digit changes  A one cent difference between  3 80 and  3 79 won t matter  However  a one cent difference between  3 00 and  2 99 will make a huge difference   Why is the left digit so important  Because it anchors the perceived magnitude   Our brains encode numbers so quickly  and beyond consciousness  that we encode the size of a number before we finish reading it  Thomas and Morwitz  2005  explain that     while evaluating  2 99   the magnitude encoding process starts as soon as our eyes encounter the digit  2   Consequently  the encoded magnitude of  2 99 gets anchored on the leftmost digit  i e    2  and becomes significantly lower than the encoded magnitude of  3 00   pp  55    Bonus Tip  You could emphasize the new base digit by visually minimizing the digits after the decimal   Tactic 2  Choose Prices With Fewer Syllables  Don t overlook the auditory version of your price  It may seem irrelevant  but syllabic length influences price perception  Coulter  Choi  and Monroe  2012    When we encounter stimuli with many syllables  we need more mental resources to process that stimuli  And that principle applies to numbers  If we expend a larger amount of mental resources to process a number  we falsely infer that the magnitude must be larger   The flipside is more important  people perceive prices to be smaller when they contain fewer syllables   But Nick  When I see a price  I don t say it out loud  I just read it   Same here  But according to research that doesn t matter  When you read a price in written form  your brain nonconsciously encodes the auditory version  Dehaene  1992   You don t even need to verbalize the price in your mind   your brain encodes it either way   Still skeptical   Coulter et al   2012  found a positive relationship between syllabic length and perceived magnitude  Even if two prices have the same written length  e g    27 82 vs   28 16   people perceive the phonetically longer price to be higher in magnitude   Tactic 3  Display Prices in a Small Font Size  Your brain has a universal conceptualization of size  Thus  there s a blurred overlap between VISUAL size and NUMERICAL size   That s why customers perceive your price to be smaller if you display your price in a smaller font size  Coulter   Coulter  2005    I explain the research in this video   My pricing eBook is 9 368 words  Click to download the PDF for free   In a layout  position larger elements around your price  Those elements will reinforce a smaller visual magnitude  which will reinforce a smaller numerical magnitude   The reverse works for discounts  Since you want to maximize the size of discounts  you should display those numerals in a large font size   Tactic 4  Remove the Comma  Researchers found that removing commas  e g    1 499 vs   1499  can make your price seem lower  Coulter  Choi  and Monroe  2012    Why does that happen  Although physical length plays a role  there s another principle involved  We already discussed it  Can you think of it   When you remove the comma  you reduce the phonetic length of your price    1 499   One thousand four hundred and ninety nine  10 syllables     One thousand four hundred and ninety nine  10 syllables   1499  Fourteen ninety nine  5 syllables   Tactic 5  Use Words That Are Related to a Small Magnitude  Be careful when choosing the language near your price  Certain words can taint people s perception   For example  Coulter and Coulter  2005  presented participants with various descriptions for an inline skate  Some descriptions emphasized a  Low Friction  benefit  Other descriptions emphasized a  High Performance  benefit   Even though participants rated those benefits as equally important  participants were more favorable toward the price when the description contained  Low Friction    When you choose the language near your price  choose words that are congruent with a small magnitude  e g    low    small    tiny     Tactic 6  Separate the Shipping and Handling  If you sell products online  you should usually separate shipping and handling fees   With  partitioned pricing   i e   separating a price into multiple components   you anchor people on the base price  rather than the total cost  Morwitz  Greenleaf    Johnson  1998   When people compare your price to a reference price  they ll be more likely to pull your base price into the comparison   Hossain and Morgan  2006  tested that possibility with eBay auctions  They set up auctions for music CDs  and they analyzed different bidding structures   Some auctions offered a low opening bid with a shipping cost  e g    0 01 with  3 99 shipping    Some auctions offered a higher opening bid without a shipping cost  e g    4 with free shipping    In the end  auctions with low opening bids  plus shipping charges  attracted more bidders and generated more revenue  Oh and Clark and Ward  2002  found similar results with auctions for the  Charizard  Pokemon card   Tactic 7  Offer Payments in Installments  Likewise  when you give people the option to pay for your product in smaller increments  rather than one lump sum   you anchor people on the smaller price   Suppose that you re selling an online course for  499  By offering payment installments  e g   5 payments of  99   you taint people s comparison process  They ll be more likely to compare your installment price   99  to a competitor s lump sum  e g    500    a huge difference that makes your offering more appealing   But don t get the wrong idea  People aren t stupid  They know that comparing  99 and  500 isn t accurate   Luckily  it doesn t matter  People often compare reference prices subconsciously  Muzumdar   Sinha  2005   So your installment price has a good chance of sneaking into their comparison   Tactic 8  Mention the Daily Equivalence  Similarly  you can reframe your price into its daily equivalence  e g    0 87 day   That framing influences people to perceive a lower overall price  Gourville  1998    You should still make your regular price the primary focus  Simply mention the daily equivalence  That low number will anchor people toward the lower end of the price spectrum   Having trouble reframing your price into a daily cost  No worries  You can achieve the same effect by comparing your price to a petty cash expense  such as a cup of coffee  Gourville  1999    Tactic 9  Be Precise With Large Prices  Thomas  Simon  and Kadiyali  2007  analyzed 27 000 real estate transactions   What did they find   Buyers pay more money when prices are specific  e g    362 978 vs   350 000    Is it because of the negotiation aspect  If someone asks for a very specific price  wouldn t buyers perceive less room to negotiate   That s what I thought  But nope  Researchers ruled out that possibility  Surprisingly  the real culprit involved priming a small magnitude   Think about it  When are you more likely to use precise values  Answer  when you re dealing with small numbers  e g   1  2  3    Due to that association  precise numbers trigger an association with small values   thus influencing people s perception   Increase the Fluency of Your Price  When determining the numbers in your price  you should also consider processing fluency   Processing Fluency   The ease and speed in which we process information   When we can quickly process information  it feels good  And our brain misattributes that pleasantness to the context   That s why you should increase the fluency of your price  This section will explain how   Tactic 10  Position Low Prices Toward the Left  When designing a layout  you should position your price toward the left  Coulter  2002    It sounds odd  but hear me out   Research shows that directional cues are associated with certain concepts  For example  your spatial concept for  up  is metaphorically associated with good qualities     the righteous go  up  to Heaven  whereas sinners go  down  to Hell  In the media  movie critics give good movies  thumbs up  and bad movies  thumbs down    people who smoke marijuana  get high   but when the euphoria diminishes  they  come down     Meier   Robinson  2004 pp  243   Due to our association between  up  and  good   priming the spatial concept of  up  can trigger associations with  good   Meier and Robinson  2004  found that people recognized positive words faster when those words were positioned toward the top of a screen  and they recognized negative words faster when they were positioned toward the bottom    The same applies to numbers  Dehaene  Bossini and Giraux  1991  found that people conceptualize numbers on an imaginary horizontal line  with numbers growing larger from left to right   In their study  they presented participants with digits ranging from 0 and 9  and they asked participants to indicate its parity  i e   whether it was odd or even   As expected  people responded faster to smaller numbers when using their left hand  and vice versa   In other words  people responded faster with the hand that matched the same side of their mental ruler   How does that finding relate to pricing   Since we conceptualize smaller numbers as belonging on the left  positioning prices toward the left can trigger people s conceptualization for a smaller magnitude  Coulter  2002    However  don t jump the gun  You shouldn t position ALL prices on the left only prices that people associate with the left  i e   low prices    Conversely  you should position high prices toward the right   a position that s congruent with a high numerical magnitude  That congruence will increase processing fluency   Lastly  we focused on horizontal direction  But we also associate numbers with vertical direction   with smaller numbers positioned toward the bottom  You could probably achieve the same effect by positioning low prices toward the bottom  or bottom left    I explain the research in more detail here   My pricing eBook is 9 368 words  Click to download the PDF for free   Tactic 11  Expose Customers to Two Multiples of Your Price  This tactic is pretty neat  King and Janiszewski  2011  showed participants the following pizza advertisements   The first two ads offered unlimited toppings   an economically better deal  However  people evaluated the other two ads more favorably   Why  Because those ads incorporated multiples of the price   It seems absurd  But rest assured  psychology can explain it   In our brain s associative network  we store common arithmetic    Over time  children are drilled on simple problems so that an association develops between operands  e g   2 x 6  and results  e g   12   These stored associations are called  number facts   Baroody 1985   Stored number facts enable a child  and later an adult  to respond effortlessly to simple arithmetic problems    King   Janiszewski 2011  pp  328   Because of those associations  exposure to two numbers  e g   2 and 6  increases processing fluency for the sum  e g   8  and product  e g   12    When the ads contained multiples of  24  e g   3 and 8   participants could process the price of  24 more easily  The price simply felt right  They misattributed that ease and pleasantness with the attractiveness of the offer   Use that insight for your own product  Wherever you display your price  incorporate multiples of that price    15   3 Day Sale for  5 Off    3 Day Sale for  5 Off  120   Get 4 Weekly 30 Minute Coaching Calls    Get 4 Weekly 30 Minute Coaching Calls  500  Get 5 Bonus PDFs for Free   100 Value   One caveat  include two   and only two   multiples  If your price is  12  a wide assortment of multiples  e g   2  3  4  and 6  will reduce fluency  To increase fluency of  12  use two multiples that result in the sum  e g   6   6  or product  e g   4 x 3    Tactic 12  Use the Right Amount of  Roundedness   One aspect to consider is the  roundedness  of your price  Round prices  e g    100  are processed fluently  whereas non rounded prices  e g    98 76  are processed disfluently   Could one choice generate more sales  Researchers think so   Wadhwa and Zhang  2015  found that round prices   because they are fluently processed   work better for emotional purchases  When consumers can process the price quickly  the price  just feels right    The researchers also found the opposite to be true  Consumers need to use more mental resources to process non rounded prices  So those prices seem more fitting with rational purchases   Despite the direct evidence  I ll propose a caveat   Even if your purchase context is emotion based  you should still avoid rounded price intervals  e g    100   5 000   People assume that those prices are artificially higher  as if they were plucked from thin air  Janiszewski   Uy  2008    So where can roundedness help  That principle can help you determine whether to add cents to your price   If your purchase is based on EMOTION  then leave out the cents   If your purchase is based on RATIONALITY  then add some cents   Tactic 13  Tailor Prices Toward Names and Birthdays  This tactic is bizarre  But a surprising amount of research supports it   Coulter and Grewal  2014  found that customers prefer prices that contain the same letters in their name or birthday     consumers like prices  e g    fifty five dollars   that contain digits beginning with the same first letter  e g    F   as their own name  e g    Fred    Mr  Frank   more than prices that do not  Similarly  prices that contain cents digits  e g    49 15  that correspond to a consumer s date of birth  e g   April 15  also enhance pricing liking and purchase intentions    pp  102   The principle is implicit egotism  Pelham  Carvallo    Jones  2005   We all possess an innate self centeredness  We subconsciously gravitate toward things that resemble ourselves   including the letters in our name or the numbers in our birthday   Some researchers suggest that we make important life decisions based on that principle  People named Dennis are more likely to become dentists  and people named Louis are more likely to live in St  Louis  Pelham  Mirenberg    Jones  2002    If you need to give someone a custom price quote  it might not hurt to slightly adjust the price to match that customer s name or birthday  perhaps after a quick glance at their Facebook page    Tactic 14  Show Prices at the Optimal Time  What should you display first  your product or your price   To answer that question  Karmarkar  Shiv  and Knutson  2015  gave participants  40 in shopping money  The researchers used fMRI to analyze their brains while they shopped for online products   Turns out  the first exposure   price vs  product   influenced the criteria that people used when deciding whether to buy   When products were displayed first  participants based their purchase decision on the product qualities   When prices were displayed first  participants based their purchase decision on the economic value   If you sell luxury products  you want people to base their decision on your product qualities  You don t want them to consider the economic value  Thus  for luxury products  show the product  and THEN show the price   Roger Dooley gave the example of Tiffany s jewelry  On their website  they emphasize the jewelry before revealing the price   Even when they reveal the price  they visually deemphasize it   as if it s unimportant and negligible   The opposite is true for utilitarian products  e g   a pack of AA batteries  USB drive  flashlight   Participants were more likely to buy those products if they encountered the price first  With that exposure  people were more likely to appreciate the economic value of the purchase   Tactic 15  Display Red Prices to Men  Puccinelli et al   2013  found that men are more likely to buy products when prices are displayed in red    Men seem to process the ads less in depth and use price color as a visual heuristic to judge perceived savings offered by the store    Puccinelli et al   2013  pp  121   Because men use heuristic processing to evaluate ads  when they encounter a red price  they re more likely to base their decision around the red price   and the red price alone     when price information in retail ads is emphasized  e g   by making it red   compared to other product attributes  the ability for people to process the other attributes of the ad  e g   photo quality of products  is diminished    Puccinelli et al   2013  pp  121   That red price became a focal point of attention   and thus the only information that men used to evaluate their purchase  More importantly  because men associate red prices with savings  they relied more heavily on that belief   Those findings also align with my research on color  In my color article  I explain why red increases arousal  which triggers heuristic processing    Maximize Their Reference Price  The past two strategies helped you lower the perceived magnitude of your price  However  you can achieve the same effect by maximizing the perceived magnitude of reference prices   This section offers a few tactics   Tactic 16  Start Negotiations With a High Precise Number  Due to anchoring  it s no shocker that sellers get more money by starting negotiations with a high initial offer  Galinsky   Mussweiler  2001   That high number establishes an anchor point  pulling the final settlement closer   Not only should you start with a high initial price  but you should also use a precise value  In one study  Janiszewski and Uy  2008  asked participants to estimate the actual price of a plasma TV based on the suggested retail price   either  4 998   5 000  or  5 012   When participants were given precise values   4 998 and  5 012   they estimated the TV s actual price to be closer to that range  When the suggested price was rounded   5 000   participants believed the actual price to be much lower   When an anchor is precise  we adjust our estimate past fewer units  Why  You can thank your mental ruler  As Thomas and Morwitz  2002  explain    If adjustment is viewed as movement along a subjective representational scale  then the resolution of this scale might also influence the amount of adjustment  X units of adjustment along a fine resolution scale will cover less objective distance than the same number of units of adjustment along a coarse resolution scale    pp  121   That insight works particularly well in eBay auctions  When creating your auction  you can generate more revenue by establishing a high reserve price   a price that needs to be met in order for the item to be sold  Higher reserve prices anchor people toward the higher end of the price spectrum  resulting in more revenue  Kamins  Dreze    Folkes  2004    Tactic 17  Expose People to Higher  Incidental  Prices  Given our tendency to assimilate toward an anchor point  could exposure to high prices   even for unrelated products   anchor people toward the higher end of the price spectrum  Would those people pay a higher price for your product   Nunes and Boatwright  2004  tested that possibility  On a boardwalk in West Palm Beach  they sold music CDs  Every 30 minutes  the adjacent vendor alternated the price of a sweatshirt on display   either  10 or  80   What happened  You guessed it  The sweater s price anchored people toward the respective ends of the price spectrum  When the price of the sweatshirt was  80  shoppers paid higher prices for the CDs   If you re selling items on eBay  you might want to mention some of the other items you have for sale  the more expensive items  of course    Tactic 18  Expose People to Any High Number  Anchoring not only works for prices  but it also works for any number  regardless whether that number is a price   Here s a striking example  Ariely  Loewenstein  and Prelec  2003  showed participants various products  e g   cordless keyboard  rare wine  Belgian chocolates   They asked participants whether they would purchase each product at the dollar amount equal to the last two digits in their social security number   After receiving a YES NO answer  researchers then asked participants to state the exact dollar amount they would be willing to pay   Remarkably  the researchers found a direct correlation between the social security number and the price that people were willing to pay  Here s the data for one of the products  a cordless keyboard   How can you apply that finding  Should you simply ask customers to contemplate a high number  Not quite  Luckily  your job is easier   Anchoring effects occur subconsciously  so consumers don t need to contemplate a numerical anchor  In fact  Adaval and Monroe  2002  subliminally exposed people to a high number before displaying a price  That exposure caused people to perceive the subsequent price to be lower   The takeaway  Even if customers don t consciously notice your numerical anchor  they just need to be exposed to it   If you run an online store  you could simply mention your total number of customers near your price  When people generate their reference price  that high number will trigger an anchoring effect  and their reference price will be higher    Tactic 19  Raise the Price of Your Previous Product  If you re launching a new  more expensive  version of your product  how should you price the old product   Some businesses lower the price to gradually phase it out of the market  Surprisingly  though  that strategy is often the wrong approach   Baker  Marn  and Zawada  2010  suggest raising the price of your old product  By raising the price  you raise people s reference price  thereby enhancing the perceived value of your new product   You ll be releasing the new product into more favorable conditions   If you lower the price of your old product  you set yourself up for failure  You reinforce a lower reference price  which makes your new product seem more expensive   Tactic 20  Sort Prices From High to Low  You can influence customers to choose a more expensive option if you sort products by descending price  i e   from high to low    Suk  Lee  and Lichtenstein  2012  tested that claim in a bar  Over an 8 week span  and 1 195 beers   the researchers alternated the sequence of beer prices  They maximized revenue when they sorted prices from high to low   Thanks to a simple change in sequencing  the bar owners now make an extra  0 24  on average  for every beer sold   But why does that happen  The researchers proposed two reasons   Reason 1  Anchoring   Reference Prices  When consumers evaluate a list of products  they use the initial prices to generate their reference price   If the initial prices are high  customers generate a higher reference price  When customers use that reference price to evaluate the options  all of the options seem like a better deal   Reason 2  Loss Aversion  As humans  we focus on losses  Whenever we choose an option  we lose benefits from the options that we didn t choose  And that hurts   Depending on your pricing sequence  i e   low to high vs  high to low   customers perceive different losses when they scan down the list of products   When you sort products by ascending price  i e   low to high   customers view each new product as a loss in price  With each new option  they re gradually losing the ability to pay a lower price  Thus  they feel motivated to minimize that loss by choosing a lower priced product   But here s the flipside  When you sort products by descending price  i e   high to low   customers view each new product as a loss in quality  Thus  they feel motivated to retain a higher quality  and more expensive  product   But here s a caveat  those customers need to associate price with quality  Without that association  the effect diminishes   Suk  Lee  and Lichtenstein  2012  conducted some follow up studies  including a lab study with pens   and they found similar results  So the findings should generalize to other contexts  e g   eCommerce products    For example  based on results from numerous A B tests  you might be able to increase revenue by arranging pricing plans from most expensive to least expensive   Tactic 21  Position Prices to the Right of Large Quantities  Suppose that you re selling a product bundle  Which order is better    29 for 70 items  70 items for  29  Give up  Research shows that the second presentation is more effective  Bagchi   Davis  2012    However  there are two conditions   1  The unit price calculation must be difficult  With a difficult calculation  customers use heuristics to make their purchase decision  Specifically  they use the first piece of information to guide their purchase decision   If the first item is PRICE   customers focus on COST      customers focus on   If the first item is QUANTITY  customers focus on BENEFITS   2  The item quantity must be larger than price  When the quantity is larger  an anchoring effect occurs  Customers anchor on the high quantity  e g   70   and they falsely infer that the price is an attractive deal   Obviously you should only use this pricing tactic if it makes sense for your product  As the researchers warn     offering larger packages without understanding consumers  perceptions can be a dangerous proposition  and bigger isn t always better    Bagchi   Davis  2012  pp  71   Emphasize the Gap Between Reference Prices  The previous strategies either  a  minimized the perceived size of your price or  b  maximized the perceived size of reference prices   This next strategy will help you maximize the perceived distance between your price and a reference price   Tactic 22  Add Visual Contrast to Sale Prices  When you compare your price to a higher price  people are more likely to buy your product because they feel less motivated to research the decision  Urbany  Bearden    Weilbaker  1988   They ve already done their homework   But here s a neat trick to optimize that comparison   If you visually distinguish your price from a reference price  e g   using a different font color   you trigger a fluency effect  Consumers will misattribute that visual distinction to a greater numerical distinction  Coulter and Coulter  2005    That fluency effect not only works with font color  but it also works with physical distance  When your price is horizontally farther away from a reference price  people perceive a greater numerical distance  Coulter   Norberg  2009    And don t forget about font size  Smaller font sizes are especially effective when they re positioned next to a larger reference price  Coulter   Coulter  2005    Tactic 23  Offer a Decoy Option  Oftentimes  people use your own products for reference prices  To ensure that their comparisons are conducive  you should consider adding a  decoy option    You might be familiar with the infamous study  In Predictably Irrational  Ariely  2008  describes a strange offering from Economist magazine  One day  he noticed three subscription options   Web Only    59     59 Print Only    125     125 Web and Print   125  At first glance  it seemed like the  print only  option was a mistake  Who would choose that option when you could choose a web and print subscription for the same price   But Ariely noticed an underlying motive  He conducted a study to test his hunch  And he was right  The  print only  option made a huge difference   Without the  print only  option  people couldn t accurately compare the options  How much should you pay for a web and print subscription  Who knows  Most people chose the web option because it was cheaper   However  the  print only  option helped people compare those two options  Because it was a similar  yet worse  version of the  web and print  option  people could easily recognize the value of the web and print subscription  With more people choosing  web and print   a more expensive alternative   the Economist generated 43  more revenue   When you offer different versions of your product  people will naturally compare those options  To guide people toward the more expensive version  you can take the same approach   By adding a similar  yet worse  version of your expensive product  you influence the comparison process  Suddenly your expensive product becomes more appealing   Step 2   Motivate Them to Buy  Even if you reduce the perceived magnitude of your price  customers might be stagnant  You should give them a nudge   This section will teach you some pricing tactics that can motivate people to buy  You ll learn how to  a  reduce the  pain  that customers associate with paying and  b  use discounts properly   Reduce the  Pain of Paying   Each time we purchase something  we feel a sense of pain   often referred to as the  pain of paying   Prelec   Loewenstein  1998    More specifically  the pain emerges from two factors   The SALIENCY of the payment  e g   we feel more pain if we see money leaving our hands  The TIMING of the payment  e g   we feel more pain if we pay after we consume   See my video for a summary of tips   Considering those two factors  you can see why Uber   a ride sharing service   revolutionized the taxi industry   In traditional taxi rides  the saliency of payment is very high  You see a meter constantly rising  Each minute evokes an increasingly painful sensation  Plus  at the end of the ride  the taxi driver makes you pay by cash or credit card  So  Much  Pain   Uber is different  No visual meter  No physical payments  Everything is automatically charged to your card  Much less pain   Credit card processing is one tactic to reduce the pain of paying  but you can reduce that pain in other ways too  This section will give you a few ideas   Tactic 24  Remove the Currency Symbol  The pain of paying can be triggered pretty easily  In fact  the dollar sign in your price can remind people of that pain  and it can cause people to spend less  Yang  Kimes    Sessarego  2009    But don t get too trigger happy  Before you start removing dollar signs  you should consider the overall clarity of your price   Oftentimes  you need a dollar sign to indicate that your number is  indeed  a price  In those cases  don t risk clarity by removing the dollar sign  Only use this tactic in formats where customers will expect a price to appear  e g   restaurant menus    Tactic 25  Charge Customers Before They Consume  When possible  your customers should pay before they use your product or service  Prepayments benefit all parties involved   For one  you won t be delivering your product or service without being compensated  You ll be more likely to get paid  Pretty helpful   Second  people will be happier with your product  When people prepay  they focus on the benefits they ll be receiving  which numbs the pain of paying  If they ve already experienced the benefits of your product  their payment becomes significantly more painful  Prelec   Lowenstein  1998    That insight can be helpful with monthly subscriptions  If you charge customers monthly payments  you should charge them at the beginning of the month  and frame your message in a forward looking manner    Avoid sending receipts at the end of a month  or summarizing the previous month s payment   You ll just be rubbing salt in the wound   Tactic 26  Attribute Bundled Discounts to Hedonic Products  To reduce the pain of paying  consider bundling your product  When you offer a packaged product  people can t attribute a specific dollar value to the items within your bundle   Related Resources  Five Ways to Use Psychological Pricing   Arie Shpanya  Ideally  the added product should be hedonic  rather than utilitarian  Since hedonic purchases trigger more guilt  Khan   Dhar  2006   a bundle reduces that guilt  especially when you attribute the discount to the hedonic product   As Khan and Dhar  2010  explain     framing the discount on the hedonic item provides a justification required to reduce the guilt associated with the purchase of such items  However  since no such guilt is associated with the purchase of utilitarian items  framing the discount on utilitarian component of the bundle has little additional impact    pg  18   If you can only add a utilitarian product  then describe a hedonic use for that product  Khan and Dhar  2010  found that people were more likely to purchase a bundled lamp and blender when the description emphasized a hedonic use for the blender  e g   making exotic cocktails  compared to a utilitarian use  e g   making healthy shakes    Tactic 27  Don t Bundle Expensive and Inexpensive Products  You should also avoid bundling expensive and inexpensive products  Inexpensive products reduce the perceived value of expensive products   Brough and Chernev  2012  asked people to choose between a home gym and a 1 year gym membership  Roughly 51 percent of people chose the home gym   a pretty even split   However  when the researchers bundled the home gym with a free fitness DVD  only 35  of people chose it  The fitness DVD reduced the perceived value of the home gym   Tactic 28  Shift the Focus Toward Time Related Aspects  When describing your product  avoid references to money  Instead  mention a concept that has a much greater benefit  time   Mogilner and Aaker  2009  conducted an experiment with a lemonade stand  They alternated three signs advertising the stand  each emphasizing a particular quality   TIME    Spend a little time and enjoy C   D s lemonade      Spend a little time and enjoy C   D s lemonade  MONEY    Spend a little money and enjoy C   D s lemonade      Spend a little money and enjoy C   D s lemonade  NEUTRAL   Enjoy C   D s lemonade   Participants were told that they could choose how much they wanted to pay   anywhere between  1 to  3   The results were clear  the  time  sign outperformed the others  Those people paid twice as much  and the sign attracted twice as many people    The researchers attributed those results to a personal connection with the product    Because time increases focus on product experience  activating time  vs  money  augments one s personal connection with the product  thereby boosting attitudes and decisions    Mogilner   Aaker  2009  pg  1   When writing copy  emphasize the enjoyable time that people will spend with your product  Not only will that message make your offer more appealing  but it ll also distract people from the pain of paying   Tactic 29  Create a Payment Medium  What do casino chips and gift cards have in common  They both reduce the pain of paying   By creating a separate medium between your customers  money and their payment  you distort the perception of paying  They ll know that they re paying  But it won t feel like it   Why  Researchers find that  with the presence of a medium  people are too lazy to calculate the conversion between the two currencies  Nunes   Park  2003    So here s a cool idea  When new customers open an account with your business  you could require them to deposit a refundable  10 into their account  to be used for your services    Since the money is refundable  customers might not give too much additional resistance  More importantly  that payment medium will distort the essence of that money  Once it enters a separate medium  it won t feel like money  and people will be more willing to spend it    Tactic 30  Avoid Language Related to Money  You could also strengthen that perception by referring to that money as   Your Company  Balance   or any name that avoids connotation with real currency    If you implement that strategy  you might also want to match customer deposits by a certain percentage  For example  if a customer deposits  10 into their account  you could match it by 10   which would bring their account value to  11    By matching their deposits  you trigger two benefits   First  and most obvious  you incentive customers to deposit more money   Second  you create an off balance conversion between their money and account value  Dreze and Nunes  2004  explain that payment mediums become more effective when consumers have trouble converting the values    With increased exposure and experience  the conversion between two or more particular currencies can  in theory  become second nature  If this were the case  we would expect that combined currency prices across the currencies lose their efficacy    pp  72   Tactic 31  Emphasize the Inherent Costs of Your Product  Customers care about the perceived magnitude of your price  i e   whether it s high or low   But they also care about the perceived fairness of your price   Even if your price is low  customers could still perceive it to be unfair  Likewise  customers could still perceive high prices to be fair   depending on a few factors   One factor is your pricing method  Consider two types of pricing   Cost Based Pricing   Prices based on cost factors  e g   costs of materials     Prices based on cost factors  e g   costs of materials  Market Based Pricing  Prices based on supply and demand  e g   competition   Customers perceive cost based pricing to be fairer than market based pricing  Xia  Monroe    Cox  2004   That s why you can increase the perceived fairness of your price by emphasizing the inherent costs of your product     consumers have little knowledge of a seller s actual costs and profit margins Therefore  sellers  making the relevant cost and quality information transparent helps    Xia  Monroe    Cox  2004  pp  9   Emphasize your product s  top of the line  raw material or any other cost based input  That information will trigger a more empathetic perception of your price   Tactic 32  Add Slight Price Differences to Similar Products  You might be familiar with the paradox of choice  When more options are present  people feel less likely to choose an option   Once people choose an option  they lose the benefits offered in the other options  Because of loss aversion  they postpone their decision   especially when more options are present  because they d be losing more benefits    That insight led to a similar finding  people are more likely to choose an option if the potential options are similar  Sagi   Friedland  2007   If options are similar  then people will receive similar benefits with any option  So loss aversion is lower   But let s question that insight   In one study  Kim  Novemskey  and Dhar  2012  asked two groups of participants if they wanted to purchase a pack of gum  Each group had two options   GROUP 1   Exposed to the same price  e g   63 cents     Exposed to the same price  e g   63 cents  GROUP 2  Exposed to a price difference  62 cents vs  64 cents   Despite a trivial difference  people were much more likely to choose a pack of gum when a price difference existed   So why did that happen  Shouldn t the first group be more likely to choose an option   since the gum was priced similarly   Surprisingly  no   When the gum shared the same price  customers perceived the packas to be less similar  Paradoxically  adding a small price difference increased the perceived similarity   Weird  right  I ll explain   When two products share the same price  people can t immediately distinguish those products  As a result  they seek out differentiating characteristics  Thus  the product differences become more salient   However  when you add a slight price difference  you reduce the need to search for differences  Customers can differentiate the products based on price  Because customers focus less attention on product differences  the two products maintain a higher degree of similarity  And that similarity makes people more likely to choose a product   Tactic 33  Use More Frequent  Yet Smaller  Price Increases  The easiest way to control price perception is through the just noticeable difference  JND    Just Noticeable Difference   The minimum amount of change that triggers detection  i e   the difference that s just noticeable   If your price is  11 99  an increase to  12 99 will be less noticeable than an increase to  19 99   Duh   In theory  that concept is intuitive  Obviously people notice larger price increases   In practice  however  that principle is very counterintuitive  Since businesses avoid price increases  they save that tactic as a last resort  They wait until it s absolutely necessary to raise their price   However  if you reach that point  then you ll usually be desperate for revenue  You won t be able to increase your price by a tiny amount  You ll need to increase it by a noticeable amount   So what should you do   If you know that you ll need to increase your price eventually  you should use more frequent  yet smaller  changes  Avoid waiting until the moment of desperation   With more frequent price increases  you also avoid reinforcing a concrete reference price  If your price stays the same for years  then people will become accustomed to your price at that specific level  Once you change your price  people will be more likely to notice   Tactic 34  Downsize a Feature Besides Price  You can use the just noticeable difference in other ways   Food marketers know that customers are pretty familiar with prices  So they often avoid price increases by reducing the physical size of their products  e g   potato chip bags  candy bars  etc     By reducing physical size  food marketers lower their costs and increase their margin  More importantly  they increase their revenue without raising their price  or alerting people to negative changes    If you downsize your product  reduce the size of all three dimensions   height  width  and length   by an equal amount  Consumers are less likely to notice a change in all three dimensions  Chandon   Ordabayeva  2009    Use Discounts Properly  If not used properly  discounts can actually harm your business  In fact  some people suggest that you should never use discounts   That advice is pretty extreme  You can use discounts you just need to use them properly   Where can you go wrong  If used too frequently  or too deeply   discounts can make customers more price conscious moving forward  They ll keep waiting for the next discount   Discounts can also lower the reference price for your product  causing people to buy less in the future  because your price will seem high    Reducing the frequency and depth of discounts can help  However  this section will give you a few other pricing tactics   Tactic 35  Follow the  Rule of 100   Earlier  you learned that people can perceive different magnitudes for the same price  depending on the context   Discounts are no different   When you offer discounts  you want to maximize their perceived size  That way  people feel like they re getting a better deal   Consider a  50 blender  Which discount seems like a better deal  20  off vs   10 off   Do the math  Both discounts are the same monetary value  However  one discount has an advantage   So how do you pick  Jonah Berger  2013  suggests following the  Rule of 100    Give PERCENTAGE discounts when your price is under  100    and give ABSOLUTE discounts when your price is over  100   In both cases  you ll be choosing the discount with the higher numeral  which inflates the perceived magnitude of your discount    Tactic 36  Provide a Reason for the Discount  To maximize the effectiveness of a discount  explain why you re offering it   For example  every day low pricing stores refer to supplier price cuts    In advertising rollback prices  EDLP stores  e g   Wal Mart  often convey the message that additional cost savings they are able to obtain from suppliers are being passed on to customers  presumably to minimize the negative effects of promotions    Mazumdar  Raj    Sinha  2005  pp  88   By providing a reason behind your discount  you reinforce the temporary and provisional nature of it  Since the price is abnormal  people will be less likely to incorporate it into their internal reference price   Tactic 37  Offer Discounts That Are Easy to Compute  Earlier  I explained how people associate precise numbers with small values  Thus  you can influence people to perceive large prices to be smaller when you use precise numerals  Thomas  Simon  and Kadiyali  2007    With discounts  however  you want to maximize the perceived magnitude  That s why choosing discounts with precise numbers can hurt you  Those precise numbers will make your discount seem smaller   Indeed  Thomas and Morwitz  2006  found that people perceived the difference between 4 97   3 96 to be smaller than the difference between 5 00   4 00  even though the difference is roughly the same    To maximize the perceived size of your discount  use rounded values  Customers should be able to compute the discount more easily   Tactic 38  Offer Discounts Toward the End of the Month  Soster  Gershoff  and Bearden  2014  found evidence for a bottom dollar effect   Bottom Dollar Effect   We feel the pain of paying in accordance with the depletion of our budget  We feel more pain when we have fewer funds in our budget   Suppose that you have a monthly budget of  300  If you spend  10 on a movie ticket  you will feel more pain toward the end of the month   when your budget is nearing depletion   This effect influences willingness to pay and purchase satisfaction  Soster  Gershoff    Bearden  2014   You re more likely to buy a product  and be satisfied with it  when you have more money left in your budget   Use that insight to plan the timing of promotions  For example  discounts  or price related promotions  will be more effective toward the end of the month   when budgets are nearing exhaustion   Likewise  you could offer free trials toward the beginning of the month   when monthly budgets are higher     if a marketer s goal is to attract new customers or generate word of mouth  initial satisfaction with trial is important  So  promotions of these types might be better timed at the beginning of the month  or immediately after consumers receive tax refunds  in order to ensure that budgets are not approaching exhaustion at the time of purchase    Soster  Gershoff    Bearden  2014  pp  672 673   However  this tactic assumes that customers are using monthly budgets  Always consider your target customers  and their type of budget      consumers may construct their mental budgets differently on the basis of individual circumstances  e g   college administrators may budget for the academic year  assistant professors may budget for the semester  college students may budget for the week     Soster  Gershoff    Bearden  2014  pp  673   Plan your promotions accordingly   Tactic 39  Position Sale Prices to the Right of Original Prices  Oftentimes you ll be displaying a sale price next to the original price  If so  which placement is more effective    25  19   19  19  25  The answer  The first placement   25  19  Biswas et al    2013  found that customers perceive a larger discount when the sale price is positioned to the right of the original price   Why does that happen  Based on numerical cognition  we can subtract two numbers more easily when the smaller number is positioned on the right   The researchers dubbed it the subtraction principle   They also found that it alters the perception of discounts  When a sale price appears to the right  customers can calculate the discount more easily   enlarging its perceived magnitude   But one caveat  the discount should be moderate in size  If your discount is either very low or very high  you might want to place the sale price on the left     at both very low discount depths and exaggerated discount depths  retailers should use sale price display locations that hinder initiation of the subtraction task  This is because when consumers calculate these discount depths  they may either suspect the retailer of opportunistic motives  in the case of very low discounts  or question product quality  in the case of exaggerated discounts     Biswas et al   2013  pp  63   Tactic 40  Only Give Discounts on Low Priced Products  Discounts can be harmful  When you end a discount  you might cause people to  a  choose a competitor s product or  b  wait for the next discount   But when and why do those harmful effects occur   The answer lies in the positioning of your brand   whether it s high quality or low quality  Wathieu  Muthukrishnan    Bronnenberg  2004    When retailers retract discounts on premium products  demand shifts toward lower priced products  However  when retailers end discounts on lower priced products  demand remains the same     higher quality  higher regular price brands are less likely to be chosen after posting and retracting a price discount  whereas lower quality  lower regular price brands will continue to divert buyers away from higher quality brands after the discount is retracted with no detrimental impact on their own initial customer base    Wathieu  Muthukrishnan    Bronnenberg  2004  pp  652   That effect occurs because of price saliency    A price discount posted by a brand not typically assumed by consumers to compete on the basis of price  i e   a discounted higher quality  higher price brand  is particularly likely to be perceived as unusual and should cause price salience causing an immediate increase in the amount of attention paid to price information and  ultimately  an increase in the weight accorded to the price attribute in subsequent choices    Wathieu  Muthukrishnan    Bronnenberg  2004  pp  657   In other words  when premium brands retract discounts  customers will still be focusing on price  Thus  they ll consider price more heavily in their purchase  Since the product is already priced high  the perceived cost will seem even larger   The takeaway   If you re competing on price  feel free to give discounts   However  if you re competing on quality  you should avoid discounting  so that you deemphasize price   Instead  remain focused on the attributes and quality of your product   Tactic 41  End Discounts By Phasing Them Out Gradually  Marketers generally use two types of pricing strategies  hi lo pricing and everyday low pricing  EDLP      managers might regularly charge  999 for a television  put it on sale for  799 for a week  and then raise the price back to  999 after a week  Alternatively  some retail managers choose to employ an EDLP tactic and price the television at  919 every week    Tsiros   Hardesty  2010  pp  60   Tsiros and Hardesty  2010  found benefits for a new strategy  steadily decreasing discounts  SDD   Instead of retracting a discount entirely  gradually return the price to the same base level    Our research supports the use of an SDD tactic  in which the television described is discounted to  799  and then instead of returning it to its original price all at once  the retailer offers at least one additional sale  such as  899    Tsiros   Hardesty  2010  pp  60   The researchers found positive outcomes on multiple metrics  An SDD strategy led to   Higher revenue  Study 1   Higher willingness to pay  Study 2   Greater likelihood of visiting a store  Study 2   The researchers even conducted a field study  Over a 30 week span  they alternated between three strategies for a  24 95 wine bottle stopper at a kitchen appliance store   With the SDD strategy  customers developed an expectation of higher future prices  which increased their anticipated regret     the  steadily decreasing  part of the discount is fundamental in providing consumers with a signal for higher future prices  which encourages them to buy now    Tsiros   Hardesty  2010  pp  59   The researchers found no detrimental effects on store or brand image   Tactic 42  Offer Discounts With Low Right Digits  If your regular price and sale price share the same left digit  your discount will seem larger if the right digits are small  less than 5    Based on numerical cognition  we compare numbers in relative terms  All else equal  a  10 discount will be more appealing for a  50 item   compared to a  500 item   even though the absolute discount is the same  Tversky   Kahneman  1981    A similar process occurs when you compare small numbers  e g   0 4  with larger numbers  e g   6 10     The Weber Fechner Law is based on people s tendency to compare disparate digits  and  hence  price reductions  in relative terms  For example  because 3 is 50  greater than 2  and 8 is 14  greater than 7  the absolute difference between 2 and 3 is perceived to be greater than that between 7 and 8  even though their absolute differences are identical    Coulter   Coulter  2007  pp  163   Thus  the perceived magnitude will seem larger for small numbers  compared to larger numbers   Coulter and Coulter  2007  conducted a few experiments  and they found support for that claim  Even when the absolute discounts were larger  people still perceived them to be smaller   Assuming that the left digit remains the same in the original and sale price  a discount will seem larger when the right digits are smaller   Conclusion  Did you trudge through the entire article  Then you re a brave soul  my friend  And you deserve a pat on the back  I spent a ton of time researching and writing  so I hope you found the insights helpful   Did you skip to this conclusion  No worries  The article is

end with one final tactic   the most important tactic in this list   If you still have trouble justifying your price to customers   even after implementing the strategies in this article   then you might not have a pricing problem  You might have a problem communicating the value of your product   Instead of adjusting price  adjust your value proposition  Improve the perceived value of your product or service   What makes it special   How is it better than other products   Why would customers enjoy it   Oftentimes  you can solve your pricing problem by communicating value more effectively   With that tactic   and all of the other psychological pricing strategies in this article   you should be able to justify your price more easily   Ready to tackle another in depth article

1212,training-dataset/product/1160.txt,product,10 Data Backed Product Tips to Skyrocket User Satisfaction  This article is part of a book called  How a Product Manager Can Keep Customers Happy when Releasing a Major Product Update   The road to churn is paved with idiocy and tales of incomprehension  Having driven on it  let me tell you that it makes the potholes in central Detroit look like lilly pads  Product managers can repave this road and regain user loyalty by following the ten points of enlightenment spelled on here  Think Descartes  Locke and Bacon   if they were captains of the industry  instead of philosophers  These articles of enlightenment can be applied when a new product  update or feature are released  Sound bombastic enough  Let s take a closer look   1  Learn from End Users  Like Descartes  constant search for perfect wisdom  there are learning opportunities around us at all times  Software vendor Primavera thoroughly studied their end users  Their users rewarded them by elevating their project management software to the top of the market place  The company grew to such an extent that Oracle decided it was too good an opportunity to miss  and bought it  Success   2  Translate User Feedback into Product Specifications  E commerce site Shop Direct found out from usability studies that their customers found it annoying to have to specify a payment option each time they purchased something on the site  The advances in human thought that come from usability studies  With this ingenius insight  the product management team at Shop Direct put together a checkout optimization project to solve this problem   3  Test Those User Interfaces  Product managers are not the end users and cannot decide in their place  Instead they must run user interface tests for representative feedback  including country specific issues where appropriate  Bupa  the private health insurance company  ran tests around the world to make sure its UK based labs got the input they needed to make better company software   4  Always Map Features into Clear Benefits  Mobile app development companies that make successful phone apps know how critical feature mapping is  The mobile apps that gain widespread acceptance are typically those that offer just one or two key  very useful functions to users  It is as simple as human nature according to Locke who believed that simplicity was one of the keys to personal happiness  One of the most popular apps of all  the flashlight app  which does exactly what its name indicates  bears witness   5  Make Signup and Installation as Easy as Possible  If users are blocked at the first hurdle  any further discussion of usability is pointless  Google understood this from the beginning  Its home page has just its logo and a search field  No more   and no less  Locke argued that we as humans are blank slates that we fill with our own thoughts ideas and emotions  In an already crowded mind why fight for more real estate with overly complex ideas and technologies   6  Release Good Features Earlier  While quality is always important  a time to market advantage can be gained by releasing good features now instead of later  If they are not quite as polished as you want  a good online help or support system can still have users raving about them  John Deere  the agricultural equipment company  used an agile software development approach to do just that and bring new functionality to its employees in 2 4 weeks  instead of 12 18 months   This is a close resembalence to the unfinished Utopian novel  New Atlantis  by Francis Bacon  The technological advancements achieved by the Bensalemites mirrors our own  Only with proper testing and careful consideration can we work with speed   7  Provide Onscreen Contextual Guidance  Users with questions about using software want answers now  They want mini guided tours to get results immediately  It is a reality of the enlightenment ideal of human exceptionalism  We think therefore we are  and if we all are we are all important and our individual needs and wants matter   A software solution like WalkMe lets a vendor or corporate IT department put that valuable help information in just the right places for user satisfaction and product take up   8  Easy Error Recovery  Mistakes will happen  But that is no reason to abandon users to their fate   SaaS data storage and backup solution providers like Box are increasingly implementing new versions to keep prior copies of files  If users lose or damage the latest copy  there are always more available from which to start again without errors   As Locke famously said  It is one thing to show a man that he is in error  and another to put him in possession of truth    9  Easy to Start  Stop and Start Using Again  Users may not use a product every day  but still need to be hyper productive when they do use it  MailChimp  the online emailing solution  offers an interface that is simple  attractive and intuitive  There are clear calls to action to help users speed towards the results they want and helpful animated pointers to show them the way   Put your users in control of their own destiny while providing them with the message best suited to their needs   10  A Support Team that is on the Mark   Smart use of contextual help can immediately solve over 90 percent of all queries  The other 10 percent may need a more personal touch  Cloud software vendor FileCloud has produced eminently usable software  yet also gets rave reviews for the enthusiasm and competence of its support team   The rise of New Science during the Enlightenment undermined ancient thought and ideas  Our new technology is doing the same  If we follow along and learn carefully  we ll be able to conquer many  if not all  business challenges   This article is part of a White Paper called  How a Product Manager Can Keep Customers Happy when Releasing a Major Product Update    The book covers a range of topics  including   Chapter 1  7 Mistakes Product Managers Make that Cause Customers to  Churn   Chapter 2  10 Data Backed Product Tips that Will Skyrocket User  Satisfaction   Chapter 3  4 Tools

1214,training-dataset/product/668.txt,product,Successful customer onboarding never stopsAs your product evolves and changes over time  you ll invest money and time in new features  big product launches and expensive release cycles  Despite this  the vast majority of new features flop   because they never get used  Fun fact  when Microsoft asked their users what they wanted added to Office  they found 90  of the requested features were already there  They had just done a terrible job of onboarding the right users on to the right features at the right time  That s because when we think about onboarding we usually don t think beyond signup  In reality  your onboarding is just getting started  You haven t turned users into experts  and they haven t yet given up all the other products they used before yours  As we discuss in our book  Intercom on Onboarding  if you only focus your onboarding efforts on new signups  you re leaving a massive opportunity on the table   passionate  engaged customers   For example  let s say somebody has been using your product for six months  They re totally engaged and up to speed  But then you release a brand new feature that can make them even better  That s an onboarding opportunity right there  Ultimately  the best onboarding retains customers over time by continually showing them how to get the most out of your product  We recently experienced this when we launched our new feature  Smart Campaigns  Front loading your users with information will make sure  they never get past the first few hurdles  We knew it had the potential to improve almost all our customers  definition of success   personal customer communication at scale  This gave us a significant onboarding opportunity   we could deliver more value to our existing customers  The challenge was that Smart Campaigns was not an easy concept to understand  If the beta period taught us one thing  it was that a certain amount of hand holding was required  The easy path would have been to ignore this and send a once off feature announcement email to all our customers  But that meant we risked it becoming a feature only a few customers ever looked at   That s why we set out to carefully and consciously onboard existing users to Smart Campaigns  Our approach was to make just enough information available at every turn  but also stay out of the way  Here s a few ways we did that  Onboard in context It s a common mistake for companies to launch features in products without any context  Your goal should never be just  get it launched   Your goal is  get it used   That s why the right time to promote an improvement is not only when someone is in your product  but when they re in a position to use it  For Smart Campaigns  we announced the new feature to customers when they arrived in the messaging area of Intercom  via an in app announcement  That message contained a video with a high level overview of the feature and instructions to get started  Like all good onboarding messaging  it s closely modeled on just in time information   teach in the moment when specific information is actually useful   Use educational content to onboard When explaining new concepts  it s important to give users a sense of what success looks like  It s a familiar technique used in onboarding   giving users educational content as a blank slate  Take Trello  for example  Users are given a welcome board with pre made to do cards  with each card explaining a different interaction  They use content and the interface to teach you how to use the product  Not only is it a great way of providing a warm and human experience to your product  it encourages action and tees your customers up for success from the word go  This is a far better approach than saying   Your campaign is empty and that s all I m going to say   You would never say that in person to your customer  so why say it in your product  When a customer encounters a campaign for the first time  there is an example campaign created when they get there   with best practice tips and links to helpful guides  Then  when a customer creates a new campaign  and sees a blank campaign for the first time  we signpost them to a guide for creating engaging messages  This is easily dismissed  but it s helpful content in the right place at the right time for those who need it  Anticipate the next questions In education  the more you hold someone s hand  the less their brain will engage  The same goes for onboarding   if you keep spoonfeeding users solutions  don t be surprised when they can t pick up a knife and fork  That s why it s better to give information as gradual hints  so new users can more deeply retain what they ve learned  One of the best ways to do this is to center information around the intent of the customer  For example  when a customer creates a new campaign  by clicking on the create button they ve shown intent  With new users interested  now is a good time to start sharing more advanced information like best practice guides  This type of careful consideration really does drive engagement  Gradually expose features over time Onboarding users to a new feature requires the same skill as onboarding them to a new product  You wouldn t welcome new users to your product by asking them to do complex tasks only a pro user would be able to do  So don t overload users when you re onboarding them to a new feature either  Think about a game like Super Mario Bros  At any given point  only the necessary parts of the game are on screen  allowing players to gradually and naturally understand what s going on around them  As you make progress  only the next piece of relevant information is exposed  Imagine you saw the entire level as soon as you started playing  Front loading your users with information will make sure they never get past the first few hurdles  For example  Intercom users don t need to know about our keyboard shortcuts until they ve been in the inbox for a while and have started to deal with a heavy load of user conversations  It s certainly not a day one announcement  Similarly they probably don t care about our bulk data export feature until they re tracking a bunch of data,"[1214 1282 999 709 222 1239 322 244 353 790 325]"
1215,training-dataset/product/682.txt,product,Product market fit in complex markets  an experience from cleantech96 Flares 96 Flares    Getting to product market fit is  the only thing that matters  to start ups  according to Netscape co founder and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen  The principle is that a product should  fit  the needs of a market for the company to scale and be successful   But how can this be achieved if some signs point towards your firm already having product market fit  while some point the other way  I want to focus on the time prior to achieving product market fit  drawing on my own experience in the cleantech space   a fragmented  complex and immature market  I hope my insights are useful to anyone in a complex market or managing a product that has historically been driven by individual customer requests rather than market needs   When trying to reach product market fit  many companies focus on the product by adding new features as quickly as possible to satisfy growing customer needs  Features may be built for a given customer or based on a limited understanding of the market  Moreover  incoming customer requests may outpace what the firm has the capacity to build  It can be tempting to push and try to serve as many customers as possible  across a large share of the addressable market  But this may make it more difficult to achieve it product market fit   What s your initial market   I think a better approach is to grow market share where the firm has fit or can get it quickly  Achieving product market fit in an initial market can serve as a base to expand into more market segments  and eventually the total addressable market  in the future  Generally speaking  cleantech firms focus on an oversized addressable market  as PayPal founder Peter Thiel pointed out on a James Altucher Show podcast in 2014  Thiel said that many firms in cleantech view the broad market as their initial target  but do not have a product that suits the various needs of such a large  complex space   Thiel advises start ups to think of the market as concentric circles  each representing a bigger share on the way to the total addressable market  Focus all efforts on the first circle and win there  then expand into the next segment and then the next while growing the scope of the product to serve each segment  Facebook  for example  started serving students at Harvard before growing to other universities and then opening up to everyone  Along the way  it added new capabilities to the product to satisfy these new market segments   Companies that don t focus on an initial market will have a variety of challenges  First  many of the product features may resonate only with specific clients  a collection of features that fit specific personas  not a market  The problem may get worse if these early clients request features that serve their needs  but aren t aligned with the market  These problems may appear as long sales cycles due to gaps between market needs and product capabilities  marketing resources spent developing a value proposition that tries to direct customers away from the gaps  and customer support resources that over manage users who are underwhelmed with the product  A recent Chasm Group post noted that one deadly sin is  target customer mix up    when the early adopter customer is fundamentally different from the mainstream customer  I would argue this is especially true in complex  fragmented markets   The total addressable market  broken into concentric circles representing various segments   Build out a taxonomy  If your firm is in such a situation  what should you do  From a product point of view  the first step is to build out a taxonomy of the key personas or jobs to be done in the market  Before looking at what the product can do today or what it could do in the future  survey the users in the market  their tasks  and where they have unmet needs  If initial customers  rather than the market have historically directed your firm  this will be an illuminating exercise  Through interviews  research and observing target users  you can collect enough information to place the personas and or jobs into an initial market  a series of market extensions  or the total addressable market  Within a given persona  or a job to be done  there will be complex and simple use cases  and it is important to track all of them  In cleantech  for example  there are a range of user needs around tracking energy performance in buildings and identifying anomalies  Some are basic and conducted by all building and energy managers  and these fit into the initial market  while others are only conducted by specific industries or building types  and these fit in a market extension   More generally  some users will be completely served by a solution that addresses only what is in your initial market  and these should be your primary initial focus   Jobs  organised by market segmentation into a taxonomy   Once this taxonomy is complete  it can be compared to your existing product  Try to determine how complete your offering is within the initial market and identify gaps that may be keeping some customers and prospects from fully embracing it  If the product is not complete in the initial market  does it solve some of the most painful problems  or do users have other concerns that outweigh the value that your product provides  Additionally  does the product solve problems broadly  or just a few of the simplest possible use cases  Some of these questions can be difficult to answer  especially in complex  fragmented markets  But you may find that your product is just a few features away from providing significant value to the initial market   Once the taxonomy has been created  comparing it to current product capabilities will identify product gaps and help determine if product market fit has been achieved  This product is performing some jobs across a broad market  but is not focused enough to have product market fit   An experience in cleantech  I first went through this exercise about five years ago  when I was managing a niche building energy management software product that supported a small set of consulting clients  The goal was to grow this product into a robust software as a service application for a wider market of commercial building operators  The product was first developed for the consultants to automate some tasks and was provided to end users as the business grew  Many features had been developed to support specific clients instead of typical users in the market  For example  one client had a unique data collection process that started before there were other options to acquire this information  Every few months  users could manually enter energy data records and the main office could track the process  This client liked the process and requested product enhancements to improve it  But  across the market  other clients now realised that they could instead capture this data directly from a utility or through a third party  and did not value software that would help manage this same internal collection process  This legacy client was an edge case and my taxonomy made this very clear  Prior to having the taxonomy  the prevailing wisdom was that  there must be other clients who do it this way   The taxonomy showed that automated data collection fitted into our initial market  because all potential users of this software first needed an efficient way to capture the energy performance data of their buildings   The taxonomy also showed that the target addressable market   enterprises with energy management needs in building portfolios   was too broad for the feature set  The current offering solved some problems for some users in some parts of the market without having a true focus  There are so many different kinds of buildings and strategies to manage energy and it would take years to support them all  Had we tried  sales cycles during this time would have been tough and new clients being on boarded would have identified the gaps  Without the taxonomy  it had been hard to identify these gaps  many of the existing clients were satisfied  but their needs were not shared by other users in the market  In short  product market fit had not been achieved   Refocusing the product  So we reduced our focus to multi site building operators with well instrumented facilities and a staff of energy professionals  The product was refocused on a few specific jobs that these building energy professionals would consistently view as pain points  With the taxonomy  I also knew that additional segments of the market would require many of the features being built for the initial target  For example  building managers that did not have large technical teams also needed to collect data electronically and store it in a single place  But  in addition to the needs of our initial market  they also needed more insight about what to do because they lacked a team to synthesize the information   By focusing on a smaller initial market  we wanted to gain more market share and provide better solutions for this core set of users  Once the sales and marketing wheels started turning within this smaller initial market  future product development could expand our focus   One influence for this plan was Geoff Moore s Crossing the Chasm  His beachhead strategy  in which a firm focuses on a subset of the total addressable market on the way to reaching early majority clients  is quite appropriate  By looking at a limited market  and building a complete product offering  firms can build that beachhead  Our focused development efforts enabled us to build this beachhead  and this solidified an initial market and served as a base to grow into additional market segments   Focusing first on the market  and building a product plan around its characteristics can be a great strategy for firms seeking to grow in complex and fragmented markets  Moving from feature persona fit amongst an initial set of customers to a solution that has product market fit requires a detailed understanding of the various segments within the total addressable market,"[1215 1134 617 80 23 129 1142 324 716 151 1257]"
1222,training-dataset/product/1352.txt,product,Before You Create Your Product  Create Your Value PropositionYour value proposition matters  It is the face of your product and how customers perceive your company  But most founders decide to create their value proposition after they create their product   Why is that   A few weeks ago  I wrote a post   How to have your customers build your product for you   that covered a variety of topics  including the importance of your value proposition  In the short guide  the first step was to create your value proposition before you create your product  This post is a deeper dive into the subject of value propositions and how you can create one that won t land your company in the startup graveyard   In order to create a successful value proposition for your company you will need to identify three elements  What you want  what your customer wants  and what will generate revenue  Determining these three components will help your company avoid potential obstacles in the future and stay on the path to success  Here is how you can get started   What You Want  What Motivates You   What most founders don t realize is the importance of creating a company that agrees with their personal mission  You are going to be the one that drives the company  and if you don t even like it  how can you expect your customers to   First and foremost  you need to create a product that you can see yourself working on for the next 5 10 years of your life   Why   Because that is how long it usually takes startup founders to create a great success in a company that they start  If you don t think that you d like your product 5 years from now  consider creating one that you will   Almost all successful startup founders will tell you the same  Founder Institute Mentor George Deeb explains this idea well   Passion is one of those intangibles that drives an entrepreneur  gets them through the good times and the bad times  and ultimately dictates the success of any startup  If you are not passionate about what you are building  you might as well pack up your bags right now  as your startup will never work    Being passionate about what you re doing may be more important than you think  In order to do this  list three motivating factors  other than money  that you have for starting your company  If you struggle to come up with three non monetary reasons for launching a startup  you may want to find another idea   Once you are able to identify what motivates you and what you re passionate about  you should begin to set clear goals for your company   What Do You Want for Your Company   All startup founders have goals for what they want to achieve with their company  Many want to get funded and achieve a massive exit while others just want to focus on making the world a better place with their offering   Regardless of what you want for your company  you should have defined goals as they will dictate the way you approach your business  Everyone goes about setting goals in different ways  but here are some good questions to keep in mind   Do you want to get funding and have an exit   Do you want to bootstrap and avoid investor pressure   Will you focus on gaining a large user base   Will you focus on generating revenue   What are the most important things for your company to deliver to the end customer   Depending on how you answered these questions  you may approach your business in a variety of ways   As you continue building your company  keep your answers to these questions in mind as they will guide you when making important decisions   What Your Customer Wants  The main indicator of the health of a startup is the quality and quantity of your customers  If your company can acquire and keep customers  you have much greater chance to succeed  generate revenue  and acquire funding   So why then do so many founders get caught up in building their company and lose touch with their customers  You can spend months building a product  but if you fail to remember what your customer wants  you risk having your product fail  Don t fall into this trap   Initially  customers will not care about your company  They won t care about all of the hard work that you ve done and all of the late nights that you spent building it  The only question that your customers will have is  What s in it for me    Once you can answer that question is when you can start getting them to care about your company and your product   Your value proposition will do exactly that  as it will influence what your customers think about your company and your product  Here is how you can ensure your value proposition aligns with what they want   Research Your Competition  One of the best ways to discover what your customers want is to determine what products they currently use that are similar to your company s offering   Once you ve identified your competition  you can begin to search for reviews on those products  What do the customer reviews say  Try to pinpoint some of these key elements   Obvious things that customers want  but are missing from existing products  Existing features that customers want executed better  Features that customers don t like or want removed  User experience complaints  Customer service complaints  Now you can build your value proposition and your product to capitalize on features that are missing in your market  This will also help you come up with an impactful selling proposition   Be Empathetic to Your Customer s Plight  Many startups are created because the founder is also the ideal customer  They want a better product in the market that they would use themselves  so they go and create one  If you are that kind of founder  you will understand this subject with ease   If you are not one of those founders  put yourself in your customer s shoes and ask yourself  if you were your customer  what would you want out of your product   Once you identify some things that you think customers would like about your product  create a few hypotheses so you can test them in customer interviews   Interview your Customers  Once you have some hypotheses about what your customer would want from your product  you can begin to interview your customers to validate them   The slideshow below will help you better understand what your customer wants and includes a customer interview outline you can use to gather feedback for your company   What Will Make You Money  If you can put together what you want and what your customers want into your company s value proposition  you are on the right track  However  there is still one more detail to consider   Ultimately  your company needs to have a plan to make money  In many situations  inexperienced founders will back themselves into a corner because they create something that both they and their customers like  but just does not have the revenue potential to turn into a successful company  Many founders often neglect to focus on monetizing  and instead concentrate on acquiring funding to pay their bills   Monetization should not be ignored  When raising a funding round  your company will still need a large amount of revenue potential   So how can you tweak your value proposition to represent a product that has great revenue potential   Symmetric vs  Asymmetric Model  Munjal Shah  CEO and Founder of Like com  acquired by Google  explains revenue potential of startups in the video below  showing the difference between  high intent  low traffic products  and  low intent  high traffic products   These two types of products are also broken down into having a symmetric and an asymmetric plans   High Intent  Low Traffic Product  An example of a high intent  low traffic product would be most products in the SaaS industry  Let s use Salesforce com as an example  Their company has a symmetric revenue model because their users pay for their services directly  They also are considered low traffic because there is no way that they could ever reach a market as large as  say  Facebook s  However  they are considered high intent because the traffic and leads that they do get are very likely to buy their product   High Traffic  Low Intent Product  Now  for a high traffic  low intent product we will use Facebook as an example  They reach a huge market  and are one of the largest websites on the internet  But how often do you log into facebook with your credit card in your hand ready to buy something  Probably not very often   Their revenue model relies on their ability to acquire large amounts of users and essentially let advertisers pay to get in front of their audience  This is an asymmetric model because the users of the site are not the ones paying for it  the advertisers are   In addition  as Munjal explains  there is  nirvana   which is to target a large market with high intent  Create your company s value proposition to target one of the 3 successful quadrants in the chart below  and you ll be setting yourself up for success  Here is an updated version of Munjal s chart   Will Your Value Proposition Land You in Death Valley   Sadly  a large majority of startups land in death valley  They neither target the high traffic sector  nor do they target the high intent sector  If you start building your company from day one to target the right sector  you will likely be able to create a lasting and successful company   See this in action  Just like the example used in my post   How to Have Your Customer Build Your Product For You   let s tweak the Founder Institute s value proposition to show an example of how changing your value proposition can change the focus of your company  Each value proposition shown here could be used for a slightly different version of the company  Let s see why we settled on  Make the Leap from Employee to Entrepreneur    A Free Entrepreneur Training Program   Asymmetric  Low Intent  Moderate Traffic potential  We are still helping entrepreneurs  and our customers would like it  but what about revenue potential  This value proposition would force us into a free model  With an asymmetric model  it would be a tough job to get enough users and traffic to make a meaningful amount of revenue and become a successful company  A value proposition like that would be likely to set us up for failure   Entrepreneur training for Broke Founders   Symmetric  Low Intent  Moderate Traffic Potential  We are still helping entrepreneurs succeed  but with a symmetric model our revenue potential wouldn t be effective because  Broke Founders  are likely to have low buying intent  Since we are not targeting a broad market  our traffic potential would not be so great either  Once again  we would be setting ourselves up for failure   Make the Leap from Employee to Entrepreneur   Symmetric  High Intent  Low Traffic  When we decide to specifically target employees that would like to become entrepreneurs  we are targeting a market that has a high buying intent  This allows us to continue to grow and be successful because we ve decided to create our product based off of something that we re passionate about  our customers love  and has the desired amount of revenue potential   Conclusion  Don t create your value proposition after you create your product  Create it first   If you are able to overcome these 3 hurdles with your value proposition  before you build your product  you will be setting your company up for success  Most founders create their company around a value proposition that only sounds good to them  Don t ignore your customers and don t ignore your revenue potential while you establish the direction of your company and product  Now get out there and create a successful company,"[1222 888 509 704 431 101 328 1253 126 23 881]"

1231,training-dataset/product/1218.txt,product,How to Find   Test the Best Price for Your ProductSo you ve built an amazing product  You ve developed a full scale launch plan  and a marketing strategy that s going to attract customers in droves  There s just one more thing you need to figure out   How much should your product cost   Learning how to price a product is an incredibly important yet too often overlooked phase of your startup  a phase that too many companies have struggled through despite having an amazing offering  However  with enough research  trial  and error  any startup can develop the perfect pricing formula that keeps customers coming while maximizing profits  and this in depth guide will get you started   Product Pricing Strategies  To help you get a better understanding of how to begin pricing your product or service  start by familiarizing yourself with some basic pricing strategies used by numerous startups  In the article   There Are Only 3 Pricing Strategies For Your Startup   Tomasz Tunguz outlines the only three pricing strategies he thinks that startups should employ  according to Madhavan Ramanujam  Board Member Partner  Simon Kucher   Partners    Maximization  Revenue Growth    This approach is designed to maximize revenue growth in the short term  and should only be employed when there are no distinctions between customer segments  willingness to pay  and when the optimal short term and long term prices are equal  Revenue maximization is ideal for mid market software companies who negotiate for the highest possible price in each sale  Penetration  Market Share    Penetration pricing requires a company to give their offering a low price to acquire the dominant market share  Startups that employ this tactic should begin by pricing low to reduce adoption friction  grow quickly  then move up market after broad adoption has been cultivated  Skimming  Profit Maximization    The skimming method involves first charging a high price for a product  then gradually decreasing it after building a customer base  Skimming is not as common among software startups  as few companies build software that are readily accepted upon launch  and even fewer have built software that have customers already willing to pay high prices   The previous three pricing methods are certainly worthy of consideration  and any of them will provide a solid foundation for a company s pricing strategy  Once you ve decided on the overall pricing direction for your startup  it s time to get more specific with how you set out to put your pricing plan in action  Martin Zwilling s article   Top 10 Product Pricing Models For Startups   describes some of the most commonly used pricing strategies  Below are some of the highlights   Portfolio pricing   If your company offers multiple products and services with their own costs and utilities  then portfolio pricing is for you  Keep in mind  however  that because of its inherent complexity  this model requires expert management to work   Tiered or volume pricing   Tiered pricing is common among companies that have products that may have one to hundreds of thousand of users  as this method allows companies to price their product by user group ranges or volume usage ranges   Competitive positioning   This model consists of pricing products low in specific markets to drive competitors out  and pricing high where competition is low  But remember  if you re competing with other startups based on price alone  don t expect your company to last long   Feature pricing   If you sell a basic version of your product or service that can be offered at a low price  you can charge more for models with additional features and capabilities  However  this approach requires costly development and testing  and your offering needs to be a good value at each level   Razor blade model   With the razor blade model  you offer a basic version of your product  often below the market cost  with the intention of generating revenue from supplies to complement your product  But because this model needs considerable funding to implement  early stage startups should wait before using this one   Determine Your Product s Price Range  Once you ve determined which pricing strategy is ideal for your company  it s time to focus on picking the right price range for your company s offering  While identifying the perfect price for your product or service may seem like a mystifying and intimidating endeavor  Sequoia Capital has some stellar advice on this very task in their article   The Sequoia Guide to Pricing   Here are some of the most valuable points   Start by forming a hypothesis  Many startups create products that don t yet have any competitors  which makes setting a price more difficult  To combat this  companies should hypothesize what they think their ideal price is  and use A B testing and other analytics to measure it  while also taking into account input from customers and employees  and what the competition  if any  is doing with their pricing   Increase the perceived value of your product  Founders should concentrate on the gap between their price and how much value customers think it delivers   the perceived value   which can be increased through better marketing of the product s key features  emphasizing their additional worth over the free or lower priced versions   Let your product s price tell a story  The price for a product or service can greatly affect customers  perceptions of its quality  which is why offerings with a higher price tag are usually seen as better quality  Try horizontal assortment  which is to offer multiple products at similar prices  or vertical assortment  which is to offer versions at multiple prices   Check your pinch points  Determine which customers consider your offering a good deal and those who would be willing to pay more by monitoring how they interact with your product  By doing this  you can discover which aspects  functions  and features matter the most to your most devoted users  the ones who would be willing to pay extra to access them   Optimize for ideal first impressions  Because customers don t often rely on logic to make purchases  it s recommended that your offering looks as great as possible to reduce the possibility of your target clients to talk themselves out of making a purchase  But don t trick potential customers into thinking that your product is better than it is  and if we have to explain why that s wrong  you shouldn t be an entrepreneur   Rather  the goal is to emphasize the value of your product  as well as its uniqueness and superiority over competitors  in a way that s clear and upfront   Click on the image below for a full checklist on testing your product price   For a lean startup approach to product pricing  Omar Mohout  Professor of Entrepreneurship at Antwerp Management School  has created a useful resource that delves into the topic   In general  startups should err on the high side of any pricing ranges they set  It s much better to price too high than to price too low  Pricing too low can hurt your brand  as products that are described as  cheap  or  inexpensive  are often seen as low quality or unreliable  However  lowering the price on a product from a high price can be seen as a brand improvement   How to Test Your Product s Price  After you ve settled on a pricing model and have established price range for your offering  it s time to test your price and determine what the next steps should be  One of the easiest ways to assess a product s price is through A B testing  details of which you can find in the VWO article   Stop guessing  Use A B testing to determine ideal price for your product   by Paras Chopra  Below are some of the highlights   Offer different products at different price points   Depending on your offering  your company should ideally present different products  features  plans  solutions  etc   each with a different price  For example  set a price for your base model  then present another product that has twice the value  additional features  functions  etc   for twice as much  and offer another product that has half the features of your base model but is only 20  cheaper  If the conversion rate for your original base model is the same as the cheaper model  despite having only a slightly higher value   then that means that your customers are willing to pay more for your offering   This process will take time and may need to be iterated numerous times  but that s to be expected with most startup  experiments   Remember  add extra value to your product when you are testing a higher price  and remove value when you are testing a lower price  depending on the what it is you re offering   In short  the purpose of this process is to ascertain the price sensitivity of your target market  Once you ve homed in on this factor  you can now offer your product or service at a price that customers are willing to pay while maximizing your revenue   Measure your revenue  not your conversion rate   During the price testing phase of your startup  it s important to keep in mind that the goal is not to necessarily increase your offering s conversion rate  but to increase your offering s revenue  It s easy to assume that a higher conversion rate means increased revenue  but that s not always the case   For example  your company may offer numerous products  or only one  that sell incredibly well  However  if your products have a small price  you may need to sell a considerably high number of products to make a profit  This problem may be compounded by the manufacturing  development  and maintenance costs of your product  as well  Inversely  selling a higher priced product but at low numbers may be enough to maximize your profits  so it s essential to focus primarily on the overall revenue your product generates        Price Product Retail Value

1239,training-dataset/product/988.txt,product,5 key lessons for successful user onboardingLeading designers and product thinkers agree that first time user experience is the most critical component of a product s flow   Julie Zhuo  Design Director at Facebook  says   No one cares about the thing you ve designed until they get past the beginning   And Scott Belsky  Founder of Behance and Partner at Benchmark  says   The first mile of a product experience is increasingly neglected over time despite becoming more important over time     The beginning    first mile of a product   and  first user experience  relate to what a new user experiences after signing up  This is commonly known as user onboarding    User onboarding is the process of increasing the likelihood that new users become successful when adopting your product    Samuel Hulick of UserOnboard com  How can you improve the chance that your users will be successful  Here are the key lessons   1  Decide who s responsible  Do not let the responsibility for user onboarding fall through the cracks  Without ownership  your product s onboarding will be an uninspired afterthought   Teams assign accountability depending on their size and maturity  For early stage startups it might be one of the founders  For mid stage teams it could be a product manager  marketing team member  customer success rep  designer  or someone else  Later stage teams may have a dedicated team   Ideally the same person or team works on all aspects of onboarding  This includes the first experience after signup and for new features  redesigns  etc  This will ensure a consistent experience for users and better alignment with company objectives   2  Understand that behavior requires motivation  ability  and triggers  Whoever designs the onboarding needs to understand some fundamental user psychology  BJ Fogg is a behavioral scientist who founded the Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford  He explains that behaviors are a consequence of 3 factors   Necessary motivation  that makes a user want to achieve a desired result  Suitable ability  for the user to achieve that result  Effective triggers  to prompt the user to undertake actions to achieve it   There is a relationship between these 3 components that results in a behavior occurring  Here s how that translates more directly for products   Here  value proposition proxies motivation  and interface proxies ability and prompts proxy triggers  When there is high motivation  users will act with prompts even if the interface is confusing  If there is low motivation  users won t act even if the interface is intuitive   It s important to understand this relationship so that all the focus isn t on creating an  intuitive  interface  Users are still assessing the benefits of your product after signing up  So you need to convey the value proposition  the why  before explaining features  the how    3  Figure out your  aha  moment  The  aha  moment is the time when a user internalizes the value your product provides  It s the moment when they re ready to buy  especially if they re on a free trial  or deepen their relationship with the product  become a fan share with friends give access to more data etc    Getting to  aha  should be the goal of your user onboarding  This applies for both product onboarding and also feature or redesign onboarding   You may not be able to articulate the  aha  moment today  so the first step is to generate a hypothesis and test it  Identify the main value proposition or differentiator of your product  You may consider the most used feature or what fans get most excited about  Test your hypothesis using surveys or user tests   Once you re confident  map out the steps users need to get there and how long this typically takes  Then consider the following 2 questions   Is this the right path  Are there unnecessary steps in this path  Which steps lead to the greatest fall off  What would be the shortest path to wow  Do users know how to get there  Is there clear direction on what to do next  and why   What do users need  motivation  ability  triggers  to get to the next step   The first question is about improving the design of your product  The second part is about building a user onboarding flow  You can see examples of both in this list of teardowns   4  Use a combination of channels  There are 3 main techniques used for onboarding new users  email  in app messages  and product tours  Use a combination of these channels to motivate  teach  and engage your users   Emails are great for transactional messages and re engagement  For example  signup success or newsletters and announcements  Email is the only way to access inactive users  so don t overload it in case they unsubscribe  However  it s out of context  Users may read your email on a different platform or on the move  so it s hard to prompt specific actions  Instead focus on developing motivation and explaining benefits   In app messages are essentially emails with context  for active users  Use in app messages to deepen understanding of your product and for important announcements or updates  They don t prompt product actions easily  so stimulate conversation and self discovery  Ensure the content is easy to digest in text and media format   Product tours consist of a variety of in product prompts  This can include takeovers  modals  hotspots  tooltips  and notification bars  Use these to highlight parts of the interface and encourage users to act  They are often designed poorly  which leads to a bad reputation  Users should find product tours compelling  valuable  and enjoyable  They should help users achieve their goals  not your goals   If you don t have the engineering capacity to build these in house  use one of these tools   5  Analyze and iterate quickly  It s incorrect to think of user onboarding as a set and forget flow  User onboarding isn t something that you can build once and then revisit in 6 months  Consider it a feature that needs fine tuning to increase engagement  or a function  e g  marketing  that needs new experiments  You ve set a goal and now you  or whoever is responsible  should measure and test variations   Don t be overwhelmed you can identify your goal  sketch out flows  figure out points of engagement  and build a flow within a day  Be lean and build a first draft that you can then test and iterate  Continual improvement is necessary to get an optimized user activation rate   Want to learn more  Check out this collection of the best user onboarding advice from around the

a pricing change with the raise  Amplitude would be free for customers tracking fewer than 10 000 000 monthly events  In Amplitude CEO Spenser Skates s words   We re giving away the same thing that Mixpanel charges  1 000 a month for   emphasis added    Mixpanel charges based on  data points   with seven tiers ranging from free for 25 000 points to  2 000 mo for 20 000 000 points to enterprise

pattern  lead with that  and if you have a business model innovation that s really unique  you ll get massive leverage    Invert  always invert    Carl Jacobi  A common example of this was illustrated by the Amplitude vs  Mixpanel showdown above  Give away what every other company is charging for  and you ll steal customers away from your competition  You ll shrink the size of the market from dollars to pennies  but that s great if you can take all the pennies   This is exactly what Sean Ellis did with LogMeIn  At that time  all of the products to do remote screen sharing were heavyweight and cost a lot of money  Noticing that pattern meant that LogMeIn could go into the market and dominate by leading with a freemium business model and moving fast by not reinventing the wheel on product   The size of the market shrank  but it was still large enough to build a big business around  the marketing got a lot easier and cheaper  and that made it possible to take a much greater share of the market   Copycat to consolidate the market  In competitive markets  there is a lot of product overlap  It s nearly inevitable that your product will be derivative of other products in the market and share a lot of the same features and functionality   These markets are trending toward consolidation in the form of the all in one SaaS the one stop shop that bundles every tool you need to do your job  Your product is going to be a suite of tools  and that means it ll necessarily look like a lot of other products  For example  Hotjar wants to provide every tool for website insights in one place  and it s bundling together features from Crazy Egg  Qualaroo  ClickTale  SurveyMonkey  and Ethnio   That means that if you want to grow  win the market  and be the all in one SaaS left standing you need to add more features  more functionality  and do more for the customer  Your product does more and more jobs  Doing more jobs drives upgrades  new customer acquisition  and growth  By copycatting a competitor s features strategically  you eat their market share until you ve gobbled up the whole market   Back to Business Basics  Never hurt anyone  You should never lie  cheat or steal  For example   Do not propose an investor meeting to get intel on a company that you intend to copy  Do not hack a company to look at their user data  Do not rip a company s HTML and CSS and pass it off as your own  Otherwise  it s business   We all want to win  and we all want to make money  We shouldn t preclude ourselves from doing something great for our business based on an emotional response to copycatting or an opinion someone else will have about your business for copycatting   I used to think of copying as just a bad thing  and I was close minded  I didn t think about it enough to understand how it could help me  The big lesson for me is to withhold judgment and be more open to uncomfortable strategies and frameworks  That will help me grow as a founder   SaaS has gotten so much more competitive over the years  and it s only going to get more competitive  To win  you re going to have to get aggressive tactically  For your customers  your team  and your family  you re going to need to take the mentality that you ll do whatever it takes to win  as long as you re not hurting anyone   What to Do When You Get Copied  Getting copied is a reality and it ll happen  so you should be prepared   When you find yourself on the other side of copycatting  just remember one thing   Stay focused on your customers   You have the best information on what the market needs  which you get from communicating directly with customers  That s your advantage over a copycat  and you need to make the most of it   How MailChimp disrupted its own business model by going freemium  MailChimp launched in 2001 and has been around for over 15 years  The arrival of the cloud around 2006 2008 could ve disrupted their entire business by enabling a copycat to build the same product  on top of cheaper infrastructure  and give it away for free   But that never happened  because in 2009  MailChimp turned its own business model upside down by going freemium  It created a free plan for up to 500 subscribers  a number that s now increased by 4x to 2 000 subscribers   MailChimp made the call by observing how the cloud was making its own infrastructure cheaper and analyzing the data it had on its customers that no one else had  Over the previous eight years  MailChimp had made multiple pricing changes and gathered tons of data on how that would affect revenue  upgrades  downgrades  etc   In founder Ben Chestnut s words   When we launched our freemium plan in 2009  you betcha we used that data to see what would happen if we cannibalized our  15 plan   The year they went freemium  they increased their paying customer count by 2 5x and their profit by a whopping 7 5x   How Intercom builds with a jobs to be done mentality  What makes Intercom so hard to copy is that it s been created with a relentless jobs to be done focus  Intercom built a single workflow for managing customer communications  through two core mechanics people and conversations  Intercom s specific products and jobs that it does Acquire  live chat   Engage  marketing automation   Learn  in app messaging and email  and Support  help desk  all operate through that single framework   Step back and look at the bigger picture  and you ll see that Intercom s framework gives it the potential to scale up to meet nearly any form of business communication with customers  And because the core mechanics are the same for each specific product  Intercom can also scale inside the organization to anyone in the company   Contrast that with copycats that tack on an additional tab in the dashboard for each product that it copies   That s what makes copying Intercom as futile as copying Facebook  Intercom s jobs to be done focus has meant that it s not just an app  it s a platform   Resources  Whether you re copying or being copied  you re in direct competition with another company  and that can be incredibly uncomfortable for most founders   But that doesn t mean you have to turn into a mean person or a bad person to compete  Don t get angry   Here are some resources and examples to get you started in thinking strategically about what you can do to win   Free freemium as a model  All in

1247,training-dataset/business/70.txt,business,The characteristics of modern customer supportCustomer support has undergone some dramatic changes over the past ten years  We ve moved from call centers  to ticket based helpdesks  to increasingly personal types of customer support   Instead of a drain on resources  customer support is now seen as a clear differentiator and competitive advantage  Better customer support beats the products competing against yours   We call this  modern customer support   and its characteristics are actually pretty straightforward  If you re prompt  if you re answering questions with the right product knowledge and if you re doing it with a tone that backs up your brand  then you re providing good customer support   For a SaaS company today  this type of modern customer support can be delivered by focusing on three things   Hire great people that are really excited about your product Give them tons of product knowledge Teach them how you talk to customers  Whether you describe your team as customer support  customer service or customer success  start with these three simple things and it s hard to go wrong   Modern customer support is expensive  But it s an investment   Einstein described compound interest as the eighth wonder of the world   Those who understand it  earn it  Those who don t  pay it   While modern customer support isn t a revenue generating tool  it is something that pays off for your brand in the long run   For example  the safest way to invest in the stock market is to put away the same amount of money over a regular period of time  If you don t adjust your behavior  and keep your investments really diversified  you ll eventually build a fortune  The same goes for customer support teams  If you want a great support team you need to keep investing in it  and keep adding to the team at the right rate so that the work is getting done properly   A mistake a lot of companies make is that they don t continue to invest in support  and the customer experience suffers as a result  But as Henry Ford famously said   If you need a machine and don t buy it  then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don t have it   The same is true for support  If you need another agent and don t hire them you ll pay the full cost of hiring them   in the form of business lost due to poor support   but still won t have an additional team mate  So always plan your hiring in proportion with the growth of your customer base   The importance of consistency  A key ingredient of modern customer support is consistency  Every customer support experience should be an absolute reflection of the way the CEO talks  the way your product talks  or the way your marketing team talks  A customer should never feel like they re getting a different experience in your onboarding  and then a different experience with customer support  It should all be seamless   Yet the mindset of a sales team in one place  customer support in another  and the product team way over somewhere else has been hardwired into company DNA for decades  Thankfully there has been a tide shift in recent years  for most decent SaaS companies and startups anyway   They ve realised customer experience isn t just an adjunct piece of the organisation that can be tacked on at the end  It has to be made a priority from the very start  and from the senior leadership down  The likes of Tony Hsieh from Zappos have made it abundantly clear   taking ridiculously good care of customers pays off in the end   Make it a priority from the start  Zappos  culture of customer support didn t happen by accident  It started with customer support having a seat at the top table of the organisation  I don t think it s a coincidence Intercom s founders made a customer support person their fourth hire  By spending so much time designing and building  they knew they weren t doing a great job answering Intercom s very earliest customers  If they didn t give those customers a great experience  they weren t going to tell other people about it and build that cycle of organic growth   By having dedicated customer support early  it s also easier for them to stay connected to the product and to know everything about it  Bringing in customer support retrospectively automatically creates a sort of division   That said  it s always possible to build a bridge between your support and product teams   It just takes strong product and support leadership to make it clear that it s really important  For example  Paul  our VP of Product is an incredible champion of our customer support team  He always reminds the Product team how much they depend on the information that comes from our customers  Customer support supplies and filters the raw data  and the product team synthesizes it and then puts it to good use building great product   What this means for your business  The benefits of modern customer support are two fold  it reduces churn and provides word of mouth driven growth for your business   The first one is obvious  If you give your customers a crap customer experience  or if you refuse to invest in customer support and let it degrade over time  you ll see a slow migration of users to a competitor who looks after them better  Good customer support is one of the best ways of avoiding churn for any company,"[1247 328 1014 1389 1026 756 1058 10 384 549 1164]"
1249,training-dataset/product/990.txt,product,Why you should write your interface firstThis is an excerpt from Making a Product Designer  an InVision e course by Scott Hurff   Imagine if you d witnessed the birth of the Macintosh project in 1979  Disco  Bell bottoms  Anticipation for The Empire Strikes Back   But in a dingy office in Cupertino  you d have seen the implementation of the first commercial graphical user interface  The invention of the one button mouse  The creation of some of the most essential  foundational apps in computing   But  even more powerfully  you d have been exposed to the idea that the computer could be something used by regular people and not just scientists or engineers   This was a huge step in thinking at the time  Computers are business machines  went the conventional thinking at the time   Not only was Jef Raskin there  but he started the Macintosh project at Apple  Seeing that the Apple II was still too complex for everyday use  he believed that the computer could be as easy to use as a home appliance   So Jef decided to define the guiding principles of what a so called easy to use computer should be  And in his book The Humane Interface  he revisited and refined his ideas about human computer interfaces   Jef believed that the success of a product s interface was dependent upon how well the designer understood 2 parties  the human using it  and the capabilities of the machine on which the software ran   One of his core beliefs was that a designer should start designing the UI with    copy   The place to start the implementation is to list exactly what the user will do to achieve his or her goals and how the system will respond to each user action   In other words  a product s interface begins with a list of how a customer will move through your product and what they ll see along the way   Yes  the guy who started the Macintosh project also started the trend of writing out one s interface first   Why   Because starting with copy focuses you on the customer and the dream product you re creating for them  You re not worried about which font you should use  the border radius on your dialogs  or the interaction convention of the week   But a lot of us get this backwards  We get sucked into the dopamine rush of inventing novel interactions and layouts  worried too much about impressing our peers in the product design community   By doing so  we risk becoming more artist than problem solver   There s obviously a place for beauty in a product  Aesthetics are known to build trust  understanding  and comfort amongst customers  But aesthetics aren t the first thing that we as product designers should tackle   In an interview I conducted with Jon Troutman for my upcoming book How Product Designers Work  Jon told me about how he uses this exact process to begin all of his design work   And it starts in the unlikeliest of places  TextEdit    I like to start in TextEdit as a content inventory canvas  where I start to type things out that I know are going to be on the page or in the app   said Troutman   Writing out your interface first forces your app s content to be well written  There s no filler content  no lorem ipsum  and no copy created solely because the design needs a gap to be filled   Troutman will then turn these words into rough HTML prototypes that can be clicked through  It s a quick and dirty way to test if a flow feels right   Jason Zimdars  a designer at Basecamp  uses a similar method   UI design starts with words   he wrote   Writing first makes me treat UI as a conversation  How would I tell a friend what they can do here and how    The traits of good interface copywriting  Here s the beauty of starting your design with words  it can help you set the tone of your product especially if you ve researched your audience as we discussed in the previous lesson   These early words are the foundation on which the walls of your interface will be built  So they d better be good  Here are 3 broad principles that you can use to make sure your copywriting starts off on the right foot  er  key   Who s the audience   Who s using your product  How comfortable they are with your product on any given screen  Are they just now being introduced to your product s capabilities  or are they veteran customers  Have they paid for anything yet  or are they on a free plan   Use the jargon you found while researching your customers to ingratiate yourself with them  What words and terminology will be most recognizable   But don t mistake your customer s jargon for your own  Internal terms like project nicknames  error codes  acronyms  inside jokes  or placeholder copy have no place in your product s interface  Your job is to make it make sense for your audience  not for you   In what tone is it written   Good interface copywriting isn t overly technical  vague  or laden with branded or internal buzzwords  It s helpful and forgiving  and it s aware of when it s delivering good or bad news   So take the opportunity to speak to the people who are using it  and in what mindset they ll be   Is your product for stock brokers  Teenage girls  Book authors  Eco conscious mothers  The tone in which you write should be conscious of this  Humor  seriousness  playfulness  precision  and other tones each have their place   The ultimate tone to strike  though  is that your product is capable of fulfilling its promise that it can be relied upon to do the job it said it can do   What s the context   Is it a landing page  A signup form  Settings  The first time a customer sees a screen  Your shipping policy  In response to something on which they explicitly took action   Good interface copywriting takes into account where a customer is reading  And it helps them to decide action they should take next  if any  Most of the time an interface is presenting information to a person so they can make a decision  Be as clear as possible about which decision might be best for your customer in this context   Effective interface copywriting also takes into account the limitations of the context  For example  if you re sending information via text message  you should be courteous and write your message in less than or equal to 160 characters   Be the newspaper editor you ve always wanted to be  The best way I ve heard the copywriting process described is to act like a newspaper editor  You re trying to create short  direct  easily absorbed text that succinctly describes a situation  The goal is to make it quickly absorbed without any effort so your customer knows what to do next,"[1249 151 1121 970 1239 23 999 325 205 559 328]"
1253,training-dataset/product/25.txt,product,20 Product Prioritization TechniquesPrioritization is a top concern for most Product Managers  It s by far one of the most popular topics on PM blogs  Q A sites and other online communities   Although it s not what we are hired to do  it s something that we have to do to achieve our real goal  creating successful products that bring value to our customers and to the business   The need to prioritize comes from a very simple fact  we just don t have enough resources to work on everything we can come up with   Thus  we need a process to determine the sets  and sequence  of things that should be done on the product to deliver the most value at each point in time  given our constraints   If we break this statement down  a core group of questions then need to be answered   How can we know what s valuable  How valuable is it  Valuable to whom   How can we define the set of things that should go together in a product release  How should we sequence those releases   How can we get the necessary buy in to follow through and get these things to the market   How can we know if our assumptions are right  Are we on the right track  Are we really delivering value  Could we do any better   What this guide is all about  If you search around  you ll find countless articles with recommendations  techniques and approaches to this very hard problem  However  each method s usefulness will depend on the specific product or project where it s applied  Your prioritization needs may vary vastly   Here s what you will get from this guide covering 20 popular product prioritization techniques   A map  in the form of a Periodic Table to help you make sense of what each technique has to offer   to help you make sense of what each technique has to offer  An overview of each method   with graphics and links to more in depth resources      with graphics and   5 commonalities and takeaways from all these methods   The Periodic Table of Product Prioritization Techniques  When I started working on this guide  I immediately felt the need to visually organize all of these techniques in a way that made sense and showed the context in which each of them is valuable   With this mind  I found two dimensions that fulfilled these requirements and the result was the sort of Periodic Table you see below     The horizontal axis tracks how oriented a method is towards getting input from the inside or the outside world  In other words  how much it depends on data and opinions from people external to the core product development team   This dimension reflects the fact that sometimes you need involvement from the outside  e g  end customers or stakeholders within the company  to help you prioritize  However  in other cases you might want to follow a simpler process with the development team or by yourself   The vertical axis shows how quantitative is the method prescribed by each technique  That is  how much of it is based on expert  personal  opinions instead of some kind of metric  classification  voting or ranking   Some people feel more comfortable around quantitative approaches and being supported by numbers  either for themselves or for people  higher up    In other instances  you need to work on the qualitative side if what you re trying to achieve is not quantifiable or if it doesn t make sense in your context   Every technique was placed in the table taking into consideration what I believe to be their relative positions along these two dimensions  Individual locations might be debatable  but I think this is a good starting point to navigate them   The next section presents an overview of each technique  including pointers to other relevant and in depth resources   This is an extensive read  so if you don t have the time right now  get it as a PDF eBook sent to your email   You will also get the Kano package and more Product Management resources   An Overview of Product Prioritization Techniques  External   Quantitative Techniques  The Kano Model  Noriaki Kano  a Japanese researcher and consultant  published a paper in 1984 with a set of ideas and techniques that help us determine our customers   and prospects   satisfaction with product features  These ideas are commonly called the Kano Model and are based upon the following premises   Customers  Satisfaction with our product s features depends on the level of Functionality that is provided  how much or how well they re implemented    with our product s features depends on the that is provided  how much or how well they re implemented   Features can be classified into four categories      You can determine how customers feel about a feature through a questionnaire   Satisfaction vs  Functionality  Kano proposes two dimensions to represent how customers feel about our products      one that goes from total satisfaction  also called Delight and Excitement  to total dissatisfaction  or Frustration      and another called Investment  Sophistication or Implementation  which represents how much of a given feature the customer gets  how well we ve implemented it  or how much we ve invested in its development  The Four Categories of Features  Features can fall into four categories  depending on how customers react to the provided level of Functionality   Performance  Some product features behave as what we might intuitively think that Satisfaction works  the more we provide  the more satisfied our customers become   Some product features behave as what we might intuitively think that Satisfaction works  the more we provide  the more satisfied our customers become  Must be  Other product features are simply expected by customers  If the product doesn t have them  it will be considered to be incomplete or just plain bad  This type of features is usually called Must be or Basic Expectations   Other product features are simply by customers  If the product doesn t have them  it will be considered to be incomplete or just plain bad  This type of features is usually called Must be or Basic Expectations  Attractive  There are unexpected features which  when presented  cause a positive reaction  These are usually called Attractive  Exciters or Delighters   There are unexpected features which  when presented  cause a positive reaction  These are usually called Attractive  Exciters or Delighters  Indifferent  Naturally  there are also features towards which we feel indifferent  Those which their presence  or absence  doesn t make a real difference in our reaction towards the product  Determining how customers feel through a questionnaire  In order to uncover our customer s perceptions towards the product s attributes  we need to use the Kano questionnaire  It consists of a pair of questions for each feature we want to evaluate  One asks our customers how they feel if they have the feature      The other asks how they feel if they did not have the feature  The first and second questions are respectively called the functional and dysfunctional forms  To each  how do you feel if you had   did not have this feature   the possible answers are  I like it  I expect it  I am neutral  I can tolerate it  I dislike it For each answer pair  we use this table to determine the category where the respondents falls  letting us know how he or she feels about the feature  From the individual responses and resulting categories you can go into two levels of analysis  Discrete   each answer pair is classified using the table above and feature s category will be the most frequent across all respondents     each answer pair is classified using the table above and feature s category will be the most frequent across all respondents  Continuous  each functional and dysfunctional answer gets a numerical score  which can then be averaged over all respondents and plotted on a 2D graph  As a general rule of thumb  features should be prioritized such that this order is followed  Must Be   Performance   Attractive   Indifferent   There are a lot more details that are worth exploring about this method  I wrote an extensive  in depth guide to the Kano model that explains the entire process and gives you a step by step guide on how to use it     Quality Function Deployment  Quality Function Deployment  QFD  is another method originating in Japan and originally described by Yoji Akao in 1966 for the manufacturing industry  When reading on this subject  there s a lot of very dry content  but it has an interesting application in our field   The most valuable thing that QFD brings to the table is a way to help us focus on product features viewed from different angles  in particular  the customer and the company  There are many dimensions of analysis and this method yields a decision matrix shaped like a house  which is why it s also called  house of quality    This great article by Jeff Sauro describes how to use QFD for digital products  Here s the gist of the process   Identify customers  wants and needs  Produce a list of things that are potentially valuable to your users and customers  Do some internal brainstorming  interview current and past customers  survey the competition and any other way to get new task and requirement ideas that you come up with  These are called the  What s   Identify the  Voice of the Customer   It s now time to know what s more important to the customers  out of all the other options  Be mindful that simply asking people to tell you what they consider to be most important  usually yields some kind of  everything  response  To avoid this  you can ask them to select the top 5 out of a larger pool of options  Use the percentage of respondents that picked each task as the importance weight factor for the Voice of the Customer  Identify the How s  The Voice of the Company   Create a list of concrete features  fixes and enhancements that relate to the tasks that customers want  Items may come the product backlog or may be new ideas resulting from the customers  feedback  These are called the  How s   Relationship between  Voice of the Customer  and  Voice of the Company   Establish an impact relationship between what customers Want and How the company proposes to fix it  That relationship should be scored in a non linear scale  so differences in impact are more accentuated  These are common values that should be defined for each Want   How combination  9   Direct and Strong relationship    Direct and Strong relationship 3   Moderate relationship    Moderate relationship 1   Weak indirect relationship    Weak indirect relationship Blank   No relationship Generate Priorities  Priorities come from the highest impact Features  across all customer requirements  This is obtained by multiplying each requirement s importance by each feature s impact  A feature s score is the sum of these values  The highest priority items will be those with the highest scores  Examine Priorities  Using this method  there should be enough differences among features to determine which are most important  It will also show if any customer want is not being solved by a how  this is perfectly fine  as long as the want is not an important one   This is how a QFD matrix looks like  following Sauro s method  I recommend reading the original article and grabbing the handy spreadsheet  to help tabulate everything     Opportunity Scoring  This technique comes from Anthony Ulwick s Outcome driven Innovation  ODI  framework   The framework builds on the core precept that people buy products and services to get some job done  That is  it s the expected outcome that matters  Clayton Christensen s jobs to be done concept shares this line of thinking and it s been a hot a topic that has gathered a lot of attention lately   One of the main conclusions from this is that customers are not very good sources of solutions  because they aren t subject matter experts  However  their input is extremely valuable in understanding the outcomes they want from the product   Through User Research and other methods  we can build a list of desired outcomes for the product  Then  we need to ask customers to score each outcome on how important it is for them and the degree to which it is satisfied on a scale of 1 to 10  Given these  Ulwick proposes an Opportunity Score that is given by this formula   What comes out from this are the most interesting opportunities for innovation  in particular areas with high importance and low satisfaction  It may also be used to identify areas where costs can be reduced  i e   customers are highly satisfied but don t rank them as important  which could mean wasted resources    These results may be plotted on a graph  providing a visual aid to better understand where opportunities reside   Buy a Feature  Buy a Feature is a fun innovation game that can be played collaboratively or individually  Here s how it works   A set of features that need to be prioritized are presented to a group of buyers  our customers   Each buyer gets a budget of play money to spend on features  Each feature is priced according to some measure of cost  complexity  effort  actual cost to develop  etc     as long as it s the same criteria for all features  you can use any one you prefer  Each player s budget should be between a third to half of the total cost for all features  It s possible to play the game in one of two ways  Individually   Players are told to use their budget to buy the features that are most important to them     Players are told to use their budget to buy the features that are most important to them  Collaboratively   Using a pricing scale that makes some features too expensive for individual buyers to purchase  This forces collaboration and negotiation between players to buy features that are valued by multiple players  As players buy features  collect the money and ask them to explain why they re buying it  The game ends when the money runs out or when players have bought all the features they re interested in  explain to them beforehand that it s OK for money to be left over    This will yield a valuable set of insights on the most important features for customers  as we can analyze which features got bought the most  the reasons for their purchase and which collaborative bids were made on expensive items   To get more data  multiple instances of the game can be played  in groups of 8 people at most   Also  for large feature sets  you can set up a championship where popular features are bubbled up through multiple phases of games   Buy a Feature is best played in person due to its collaborative character  but there are online solutions if that s what you need   Check out this article for a more detailed game explanation and templates for feature cards and play money notes   A side note for Project Managers  This method is also very useful for internal or consulting projects that are not exposed to the market  by involving stakeholders as the buyers in the game  It s a great way to build strategy for the project  consensus on what s most important  and communicate to stakeholders the notion that features have different development costs   External   Qualitative techniques  Story Mapping  Story Maps were first introduced by Jeff Patton in this 2005 article and followed up by another one writing up his more recent experience  Both are excellent reads that I can t recommend highly enough   The main idea behind Story Maps is that single list product backlogs are a terrible way to organize and prioritize the work that needs to be done  A richer structure is necessary   In very broad strokes  a Story Map is organized like this   There s a horizontal axis that represents usage sequence   User stories  or  tasks   are placed along this axis  in the sequence in which they are performed by the user     The vertical axis stands for criticality   User stories  or  tasks   are arranged vertically as to how important they are  from top to bottom   Equally important stories can be kept at the same height  but keep in mind that  in general  it s important to differentiate stories  relative importance to be able to create better release plans     Groups of related user stories can be grouped as Activities  Create a vertical line to separate groups of stories from others  For example  an activity may be  managing email   with  send an email to one or more addresses  being a user task  Activities sit above the vertical axis and don t have any usage sequence  they  just are    these activities compose the major attributes for the product and can t be prioritized  think  you can t prioritize a car s motor over its wheels      There are many advantages to this kind of backlog organization  but the most relevant to prioritization and execution are these   It s a visual tool that lets customers  stakeholders and development team members share a common understanding of what the system does   It very clearly defines how to incrementally release product iterations that deliver complete working releases with increasing sophistication   this is Alistair Cockburn s concept of the walking skeleton  To define releases  create horizontal lines along the map  selecting stories with equivalent criticality levels  This leads to complete end to end versions of the product and consequently to faster delivery and market validation  crucial at the MVP stage      In my personal opinion  the main drawback for this structure  and the necessary time investment to create and groom it  is that it s too heavy for projects or products in highly dynamic contexts  That is  when visibility into the future shape of the product is not great  e g  sub 3 to 6 months   I prefer a different  but related  approach     MoSCoW  The MoSCoW method is a prioritization technique used in multiple management fields to reach a consensus on what s more important to stakeholders and customers   The term is an acronym with each letter standing for one of the possible prioritization categories  with Os added to make it memorable   Requirements are thus classified as   Must have   these are critical and must be included into the product  If even one isn t included  the release is considered a failure  These can be downgraded if there s agreement among stakeholders   have   these are critical and must be included into the product  If even one isn t included  the release is considered a failure  These can be downgraded if there s agreement among stakeholders  Should have   these requirements are important but not crucial for the release  They re the first level of  Nice to have   and generally share the importance of MUST requirements  without being so time sensitive   have   these requirements are important but not crucial for the release  They re the first level of  Nice to have   and generally share the importance of MUST requirements  without being so time sensitive  Could have   these requirements are desirable but not necessary for the release  They re usually low cost enhancements to the product  Due to their lower importance  they re the second level of  Nice to have  features   have   these requirements are desirable but not necessary for the release  They re usually low cost enhancements to the product  Due to their lower importance  they re the second level of  Nice to have  features  Won t have   these are considered to be the least critical or even not aligned with the product strategy  They are to be definitely dropped or to be reconsidered for future releases   This method offers a quick and simple prioritization solution  The problem comes with its lack of grading within categories  For instance  how can we know which SHOULD or COULD requirements are more important than others  Because of this limitation  the MoSCoW method is probably better suited for internal projects instead of products with many customers   talking to a handful of stakeholders about prioritization subtleties will always be easier than a larger scale contact with end customers     Prune the Product Tree  Another innovation game from Luke Hohmann  Prune the Product Tree is about shaping the product s direction towards market needs  but also understanding if some product areas are being left behind   The analogy in the game is that the product is a tree that will be pruned to our liking  Although gardeners do this by cutting parts of the tree  the goal is to shape   it s not about the cutting   Here s how it works   Draw a large tree on a whiteboard or sheet of paper   Thick limbs represent core product areas and its outermost branches represent currently available features   Write potential new features on some Post It notes   Ask customers and stakeholders to place their desired features on the tree  thus defining its next phase of growth   From here you may extract valuable data points  Is the tree growing in a balanced way  Are specific areas growing disproportionately larger  Are previously under developed areas growing now   Having a shared view of the entire span of the product with customers can be very insightful when planning new releases  From this visual balance you derive relative value among features  understand which strategic shifts might need to be done and which areas of the product are good candidates for being dropped in the future     Speed Boat  One final innovation game in this overview  I find this one particularly interesting because it focuses on a different kind of prioritization  identifying which are the least liked features in the product   If you ask people to tell you about their grievances on the product  you may be in for a dose of frustration  Creating a  let it all out  kind of session with customers can generate a large amount of feedback with a lot of noise   If you instead ask the same thing with a controlled and positive turn  you will be able to get to the truly important customer complaints  And that s the premise for this game  It goes like this   Draw a boat on a whiteboard or large piece of paper   This is a speed boat  and it should go really  really fast   Unfortunately  it s being held back by some anchors   The boat is the product and anchors are the features that customers feel frustrated with   Ask customers to write on Post it notes the features they re not happy with and how much faster they estimate the boat could move without those anchors   Each anchor and speed estimate will give you a measure of  pain  which you can later prioritize for improvement   Hohmann s insight is that although customers may have complaints  they re almost never all out against the product  Most of the time they want to succeed using it  despite their frustration  That s why creating this gamified outlet is more effective   it sidesteps the groupthink that may arise in a  share your complaints  session  and frees people to express their opinion with less bias   Internal   Quantitative Techniques  Financial analysis  Product initiatives and projects are often undertaken with a specific goal of increasing revenues or reducing costs  Also  many organizations require a business case for new product features  For these and similar situations  it s necessary to do a financial analysis of candidate development themes  Those with the best financial outcomes are then prioritized   We ll explore common metrics for evaluating financial returns  but I suggest reading more on the subject if you re interested in this kind of analysis and prioritization  as it gets complex pretty rapidly  Mike Cohn s excellent book  Agile Estimating and Planning  dedicates an entire chapter to this topic   There are 4 kinds of financial goals we can expect as a consequence of improving the product in some way   New Revenue   new income that is projected to be generated     new income that is projected to be generated  Incremental Revenue   additional income from existing customers by now being able to charge for an upgrade or additional services     additional income from existing customers by now being able to charge for an upgrade or additional services  Retained Revenue   income that s not lost because customer churn is reduced     income that s not lost because customer churn is reduced  Cost Savings  any type of operational efficiency that is gained inside the company   These goals can be estimated over a given timespan for each theme we re trying to prioritize  giving us the total projected revenue they will generate   The problem is that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow  An initiative that returns  10K   20K   30K over three quarters is less valuable than one with the same returns in reverse order  More sophisticated comparison methods are needed  We will go over three measures enabling us to answer these questions    How much of today s money will we have after X amount of time  if we invest in this project    What s the return on this project in percentage terms     How long will it take to earn back this investment    By analyzing these metrics in combination  teams can make investment decisions for the future of the product based on the company s financial priorities and desired outcomes  Still  take these quantitative methods with careful consideration   they re all based on revenue and cost estimates  and we all know how easily those can be wrong  willfully or not    Net Present Value  NPV   How much money would be need to put in the bank so by the end of 1 year we d have  10  This is what s called the Present Value of some amount and it depends on the interest rate the bank is paying  like so   For a 5  interest rate  we d need to put  9 52 in the bank today to have  10 in a year  Moving future amounts to their present value is called discounting   When evaluating alternative projects in which to invest  companies consider an Opportunity Cost in place of an interest rate  It represents what s not earned as a consequence of investing in something else  If a company usually gets a 15  return on its projects  then that s the opportunity cost against which an alternative project should be compared to   A product initiative will produce a sequence of cash flows over time periods  e g  months or quarters   Each of them must be discounted to their Present Value  PV   The Net Present Value is the sum of these items over some time period  and is given by this formula   This method allows a company to prioritize between projects by providing an answer to this question   How much of today s money will we have after X amount of time  if we invest in project A or project B    Internal Rate of Return  IRR   Internal Rate of Return is a measure that expresses the return on a project in percentage terms  In other words  it shows how quickly an investment will increase in value   IRR is defined as the interest rate at which the NPV is equal to zero  It s hard to calculate manually  but spreadsheet apps come with this formula  making it trivial to get to   you just need to input the necessary investments and cash flows over time   From this value  you get a project s return and can compare it to others  However  this shouldn t be taken in isolation to make decisions  as the overall NPV or the investment time it takes may be important decision factors   Discounted Payback Period  The final factor to take into account is how long it will take to get back the investment  For this  we look at the running total of the sum of discounted cash flows  When it turns positive  it means the investment has been recovered   What this number doesn t tell us is how much money will be made  However  it is useful to measure the level of risk associated with a project  The longer it takes to make the money back  the riskier it is  Depending on the company s financial conditions and risk tolerance  this can be a critical factor     Ian McAllister s Framework  I don t think this framework has an official name  hence the uncreative one I m using   Given its author s experience and the huge popularity it has on Quora  it s well worth including in this overview  Here s how it works   Define the important themes for the product or business  Create a list of the most important themes  e g  customer acquisition  engagement  activation  ARPU  and select the top three  Prioritize and resource the themes  Define the relative priority for each theme and how much resources you want to invest in each  team members  marketing  etc   Generate project ideas  Use projects ideas you already have for each theme and come up with new ones  Keep in mind the Pareto principleand focus on the 20  of the project that will get you to 80  of the desired outcome  Estimate each project s potential impact  Work out the impact you expect from each project  in very broad terms  think order of magnitude similar   Estimate each project s costs  With your team s  and relevant stakeholder s  help  come up with an estimation for each project s costs  Prioritize project within each theme  Set priorities considering the projects with the best impact to cost ratios   You should check out Ian s original answer for more details and to read about the multiple benefits he finds in this framework  Out of those  the one that jumps out to me as the most useful is to resource themes independently  That is  pick the important themes and assign team members and other resources beforehand  This sets you free from constantly struggling to prioritize very different themes that you may be developing in parallel     Impact on Business Goal  Another way to look at prioritization is to align it with business goals and Lean best practices  One cornerstone of the Lean Startup movement is the concept of Validated Learning  As Eric Ries puts it        to treat everything we do as entrepreneurs as an experiment   as a scientific experiment designed to help up figure out if we are actually on the path to a sustainable business    Following this line of thinking  Dave McClure introduced the AARRR metrics for startups  They re centered around 5 stages in the customer lifecycle   Acquisition   users come to the site   product     users come to the site   product  Activation   users enjoy 1st visit  signup     users enjoy 1st visit  signup  Retention   users come back multiple times     users come back multiple times  Revenue   users  activity leads to revenue for the product     users  activity leads to revenue for the product  Referral  users like product enough to recommend to others   These stages are a funnel through which  potential  customers advance  The goal is to broaden the funnel as much as possible between stages   When defining features for the product  associate a business objective from one of these stages  There may be features or enhancements expected to improve Activation or Revenue  for example  Prioritization then becomes a matter of answering these questions   which business goal are we trying to improve at this moment   which features are expected to have the biggest impact on that goal   Depending on the kind of metric or goal you re targeting  it s probably best to focus on testing and optimizing just one at a time  This makes it easier to measure the results of what was done and use that to decide what to do next  move on to another metric or keep improving the same one   Specially for early stage products  this kind of framework brings a single minded  quantitative and business aligned focus to prioritization  which can be very helpful     Value vs  Risk  One classic way of prioritizing is to compare the Value of what is to be done to some other measure of tradeoff  Usually that measure is Cost  and we ll go over that in the next section    However  Mike Cohn also talks about considering Risk as a prioritization factor in his book  which I ve found to be an extremely valuable approach for new products and initiatives   Features are scored in two dimensions  Value and Risk  There are no prescribed ways to estimate value  and for that you may use one of the other techniques presented here  As to Risk  there are multiple kinds  but we re usually concerned with   Schedule risk  e g   this might not be done by the time we need it     e g   this might not be done by the time we need it   Cost risk  e g   this might cost more to run than what the business case allows     e g   this might cost more to run than what the business case allows   Functionality risk  e g   we might not be able to do this    There s a constant struggle between high risk and high value  What should be done first  On one hand  if you avoid risky items and go for high value first  you might develop a large part of the product before hitting a major roadblock  On the other  if you focus on working on high risk items first  you might end up doing unnecessary work on features that turned out to be less valuable   The goal is to look for a balanced approach  going for High risk High value first  Low risk High value second and finally Low risk Low value  High risk Low value items are best avoided   Value vs  Cost  This is a very common prioritization technique with the advantage of also being very simple  Features are scored on their Value and Cost of implementation  Those with the best ratios will have higher priority   Also called Bang for the buck  the inherent ROI like analysis in this method feels intuitive and is also embedded within other prioritization techniques   The main goal with this method is that we try to maximize value deliveryover time  That is  for a given release timeframe  we work on the most valuable items we can fit in the period   To visualize this technique  use a Value vs  Cost graph  Scatter plot all features being considered  with regards to their score in each dimension  Then  prioritization rankings will be visible as the slopes of the lines going from the origin to each feature  The higher the slope  the higher the priority   However  one thing to look out for is the tendency to prioritize low cost  low value items  which have good Value Cost ratios   As Teresa Torres writes    If you use time to build to prioritize what to build next  you ll end up with a product full of easy solutions    As usual  just carefully consider what comes out of prioritization methods and use them as guidelines and not definitive answers     Scorecard  The Scorecard is another popular technique  The goal is to prioritize features over a set of criteria that have been negotiated with stakeholders  Here s Daniel Elizalde s sensible take on the subject   Start with a clear strategy that has been validated by users  Select the features that are most related to the overall strategy for the next release  Define a criteria and weights for scoring  Meet with stakeholders and fine tune the criteria and weights  Go over all candidate features themes and assign a score  e g  from 1 to 100  on their respective impact for each criterion   Another way to allow full use of the point scale is to identify a feature theme that is considered to be in the middle of it for each criterion  Then  score all other features in comparison to that one  a shorter scale  from 1 to 5  will work best in this approach   The scorecard can be a useful exercise for companies to evaluate what they believe is the relative impact on strategic objectives for a group of possible new features   There is however very valid criticism for this method   Is it scoring the right things   i e  are scoring categories really aligned with the product strategy    Are weights and scores  cooked  to prioritize features already favored by opinion and politics  while at the same time give the appearance of objective analysis   It can lead to fragmented products  unfocused from their Unique Value Proposition   Theme Screening  Theme Screening is related to Scorecards  but its focus is on evaluating themes and features in relative terms  The workflow is similar   Define the criteria under which to evaluate features and themes  For each criterion  choose a  baseline  feature theme  A good baseline theme is one that is likely  but not guaranteed  to be chosen for the next release  For each feature theme  score it in comparison to the baseline  a     if it has a higher impact than the baseline  a  0  if it s neutral and a     if it has lower impact  For each feature theme and scoring criterion  calculate its Net Score and rank features by this value   Perhaps by having a bit less confirmation bias  in the form of criteria weights and scoring scales   this method can sidestep some of the drawbacks of scorecards  Also  if considering a single category for ranking  this can be the scoring tool for other prioritization methods that focus on features  impact on a given business metric or the product s Unique Value Proposition   Internal   Qualitative Techniques  Classification Ranking  This kind of ranking is one of the most straightforward  and naive  that we can use  It is however useful for very small and internal projects   The process is simple  each feature is classified into some category  and then a ranking is produced  Categories must be sortable in some way  e g  1 2 3 4 5  High Medium Low   It s related to MoSCoW  but as it s typically based on personal   expert   opinions  I ve classified it on the Internal side of methods  You can use it with other stakeholders but the ambiguity of categorization will almost certainly lead to trouble  Better keep it to yourself if you use it at all     Systemico Model  The Systemico model aims to provide a framework to prioritize entirely in terms of Value to the customer and view that process as something that is systemic and holistic  hence the name    Product requirements are made visible in terms of how they address user goals and engagement levels   The team behind this model has found it to be of particular usefulness  when working on new products and domains that need to be customer and or user centric  especially when there is little or unknown validated learning    This model is related to Story Mapping  as it also creates a two dimensional grid that makes it easy to visualize the scope of the product and the different priority levels   User Goals   The first dimension is User Goals  The product is defined not in terms of What it does but in terms Why some functionality is necessary     The first dimension is User Goals  The product is defined not in terms of What it does but in terms Why some functionality is necessary  User Engagement   The second dimension uses user engagement as a measure of the interaction level between the user and the product  There are four degrees  in decreasing urgency   Core   Features to satisfy users  basic needs  These are baseline expectations for users in this product space  Use   New and improved features to increase the product s usability  Without these  the product has minimal appeal to the user  Engage   Functionality drawing the user to have more interaction with the product and entices her to come back in the future  Explore   Features that build a stronger connection between the user and the product as they promote going beyond simple interactions     The second dimension uses user engagement as a measure of the interaction level between the user and the product  There are four degrees  in decreasing urgency    User Stories are then placed within the corresponding User Goal and Engagement levels  As User Stories themselves may carry additional value and cost attributes  this model turns into an easy to explore multi dimensional system   Just as in Story Mapping  it s possible to create a release plan that creates increasing value for the customer  and at the same time gather feedback before investing heavily on a given feature set   Another Value Mapping approach  The kind of Value Maps that the Systemico Model and Story Mapping create are incredibly useful  They let us visualize different impact levels that features may have on some user goal or activity  leading to easier release planning   If these approaches show Impact across Product Areas  the Intercom team proposes a prioritization scheme based on Impact on User Base  That is  focusing on what s used the most by a majority of the product s user base     Stacked Ranking  The typical backlog is a flat list of items  This guide covers many techniques on how to organize it differently and how to prioritize it  Most of them will produce a stacked ranked list of themes or features to develop   However in many instances  probably the majority   this stacked ranking is based upon a Product Manager s own  expert  opinion  In other cases  this list is based on conversations and talks with stakeholders   This kind of prioritization in not inherently wrong  it s just not right for user focused value creation  Due to its widespread usage  it deserves a mention in this guide but its position in the table aims to reflect that this as opinion based and internally focused as it gets     Feature Buckets  The Feature Buckets technique by Adam Nash is also very popular on Quora   Adam believes that feature prioritization varies a lot across different product types and industries and that s why he emphasizes that this technique was thought specifically for consumer internet products   Feature concepts should be placed in one of four buckets   Metrics Movers   Features that will move the target business and product metrics significantly  There should be specific goals and strategies behind the decision to invest in a product or feature  things like AARRR metrics come in handy here      Features that will move the target business and product metrics significantly  There should be specific goals and strategies behind the decision to invest in a product or feature  things like AARRR metrics come in handy here   Customer Requests   These are features that have been requested directly by customers  They are usually incremental enhancements  but it s important to consider them or else risk alienating users or miss important feedback coming from their usage of the product

that are included for strategic reasons related to learning or future goals  e g  experimentation and data gathering    A well balanced product release should typically include features from all of these buckets  The framework is not explicit as to the appropriate distributions among these buckets and to how to prioritize internally within each  These implementation details are left up to the Product Manager to define     KJ Method  One final Japanese technique in this overview  The KJ Method is a technique devised by Jiro Kawakita as a group process to establish priorities  It quickly produces  objective group consensus out of a collection of subjective  opinionated data   It s on the Internal side of techniques as the way its usage is described is mostly targeted at stakeholders within the same organization   UIE describes an 8 step process for any group size in under an hour  First  ensure you have the following preconditions   Removable sticky notes in two colors   Room with lots of wall space   One person to be the facilitator  moving the group from one step to the next    Whiteboard or flip chart for the final ranking step   With all of the above  the facilitator follows this process   Determine a Focus QuestionThe focus question drives the results  Every session will have its own focus question  e g   Who are our users     What goals do users have when they come to our site    etc   Organize the GroupPeople in the group should be from different parts of the organization  to get more diverse perspectives  Put Opinions  or Data  onto Sticky NotesPutting one item on each sticky note  each group participant is asked to brainstorm as many items as they can think of  Put Sticky Notes on the WallEach participant puts their sticky notes up on the wall in random order  They also read other people s contributions  If they think of something else that should go on the wall  at any time  they can just add it to the collection  Group Similar ItemsOnce everyone has added their contributions to the wall  the facilitator instructs the group to start grouping similar items in another part of the room  Naming Each GroupEach participant is asked to assign a name to every group  using the second color of sticky notes  Voting for the Most Important GroupsParticipants are asked to individually use their own viewpoint to choose which groups he or she believes are most important to answering the focus question  Ranking the Most Important GroupsThis is the final and most important step  All individual sticky notes are placed on the whiteboard and ordered by number of votes  Participants can combine similar groups  which adds their votes and moves them up the ranking  When three to four groups have much higher ranking than the rest  the facilitator may stop the exercise   Because of the combination of free individual opinion through voting and the enforced unanimous consensus in the final step  this method can quickly converge to a group buy in of priorities  This helps any teams that depend upon stakeholders  participation and agreement on the product strategy and priorities   Key Takeaways  After going through all of these techniques you will have probably noticed that they each have contexts in which they make sense to be used and others when they don t  As much as we d like to  there are no prioritization silver bullets and we have to choose whatever is more appropriate for our product  team  industry  etc  At the same time  there are important commonalities among these methods that are worth pointing out   Let s go over the most important takeaways from this fascinating task we call Prioritizing   1  Prioritize at a high level  Essentially all prioritization methods work with high level features  themes  and user goals  This is important for a couple of reasons   The focus is on providing value to the user and not the minutia  at least at first    You don t waste as much time if when the strategy changes   After working out the strategy and high level priorities  the team should take care of finding the best tactics to get there   2  Set goals  measure and adjust  Another common characteristic among many techniques is their focus on Effectiveness  They have an underlying notion that our motivation to prioritize is that we re going after some goal with a measurable effect  impact  ROI  usage  improved business metric  etc    The objective is not to set priorities and ship them  The objective is to constantly be aware if what we re doing is really adding value and working out as expected  when it s not  we will at least have some clues as to what needs adjustment   3  Don t do it alone  Prioritization should not be a solo effort  With the exception of very simple methods  almost all of them involve someone else in the process  Be they customers  stakeholders or team members  it s very rare that the Product Manager alone will set the overall priorities  We re just in charge of a process and the product belongs to the team   Getting the most external input we can gets us buy in and confidence that what gets prioritized is effectively valuable  And even then  we re only sure after measuring the actual results   4  Quantitative vs  Qualitative  Quantitative does not mean better than qualitative  and vice versa    For instance  a common pitfall when using quantitative prioritization methods is that people associate numbers with precision and confidence  Seeing formulas  ratios and rankings usually makes us feel more assured as to the robustness and objectivity of some type of analysis  but these can be gamed  You should keep this in mind both for yourself and when presenting results to other people   these things are guidelines and not infallible outcomes   Know what you re getting out of the method and when to use it  These things are tools  not oracles   5  External vs  Internal  The External and Internal distinction that we ve used in this guide relates to how much external involvement there is in the prioritization process  The scale goes something like this  You   Team   Stakeholders   Customers   Again  it all depends on the results you re trying to get  I ve personally found it useful to think about it in these terms   External techniques are better for prioritizing abstract outcomes    are better for prioritizing   Internal techniques are better for prioritizing concrete solutions   The value of External techniques  In broad terms  external techniques are most useful when you re trying to navigate through a large set of candidate features  looking to   Identify the most valuable ones for your customers   knowing their baseline and performance expectations and also what delights them   Getting buy in and consensus from a group of key stakeholders in larger organizations   Gauging which features are not bringing value or actively displeasing customers so you can decide wether to improve or to drop them   Getting clients in consulting projects to participate and sign off on the development strategy and release plan   Since you re dealing mostly with  the outside world  is only natural that discussions and prioritization here happen at a more abstract level of user outcomes  goals and high level features   The value of Internal techniques  Because you re involving people that are closer to the product and technology  these techniques are best for prioritizing among more concrete and problems  That is  they re less exploratory as end users are less involved  if at all   Thus  they work best whenever you have to   Further refine the results obtained from one of the more externally oriented techniques   Prioritize a set of features and ideas that you re confident are aligned with the product strategy and customers  expectations   Work on internal projects without much  or no  contact with the market   Quickly prioritize low level features and requirements   With all of these techniques and takeaways in hand  it s now up to you  Mix and match them  Make changes  But above all  go out and build great products   If you ve made it this far and found this guide helpful  it would be great if you could share it with friends and colleagues that you think might also appreciate it  Also  if you have any comments or questions  just get in touch,"[1253 1183 1142 916 1164 1417 642 101 325 431 126]"
1257,training-dataset/product/228.txt,product,Pros and Cons of Market Research Tactics86 Flares 86 Flares    When it comes to capturing the public s imagination  few works of fiction have ever done it as well as the movie Jurassic Park did almost 25 years ago   I couldn t believe it s been that long either  The special effects were insane for the time  but even more amazing was how the way they resurrected dinosaurs seemed so scientifically plausible  Silly as it was  the Mr  DNA sequence showing how the scientists in the movie extracted dinosaur DNA from fossilized mosquitoes and then used frog DNA to complete the gene sequence kind of makes the entire movie work    Frog DNA  is a concept I return to every now and then with my colleagues  If the reasoning behind a feature hasn t been validated somehow through user feedback  it s frog DNA  That is  it ought to be right  but we made a few logical jumps to get there  We all do that from time to time  especially when we don t have the contacts or the time to vet ideas with potential users  But it s a dangerous thing to add to your product   As the product manager survey results that we published on Mind the Product suggested  listening to the market doesn t happen enough among enterprise software designers  So in the absence of a Rolodex of contacts  you ve got to take it upon yourself as the product owner to use all of the means at your disposal to capture feedback on an idea and understand the pros and cons of each   Join Sales Calls  This is probably the most common means of gathering market feedback by product managers  and with good reason  I try to listen in on at least one sales call every day just to hear what problems the prospect articulates and how they react to our pitch  It s a great  low cost way to learn  Just be aware that your sample is biased in favor of those who are already in your pipeline   the ones who presumably feel a pain already  That s only a tiny sliver of your addressable market  You ll have a harder time learning from sales calls how the other 80  of the market survives without your solution today   Talk to Existing Customers  The biggest advantages of getting feedback from existing customers are the fact that they know your product already and so you can skip right to the new idea you ve got  The downside is that this sample is even more biased than your sales pipeline  Existing customers have a stake in your product supporting their existing work flow  Customers may value predictability over enhancements  which gives you false signals about where the value lies   Attend Conferences  In my experience  conferences have been better for gathering competitive intelligence and looking to the horizon than getting cold  hard feedback on your product  especially if networking in ballrooms doesn t come easily to you   Still  the right conference can be a great way to meet contacts if you have the budget and time to attend them  When you add up flights  hotels  and conference fees  the cost benefit ratio can get out of whack quickly  so choose your spots carefully or you ll blow through budget without much to show for it   Recruit a Panel From a Traditional Expert Networking Firm  Depending on how specialized your product is  expert networking firms can be a great way to acquire industry knowledge from people with rare expertise  These services usually aren t geared toward helping you find everyday users and buyers though  And at anywhere from  8 12K to recruit a focus group  the cost puts it out of reach for many small and mid size projects  However  tools like Zintro offer a more cost effective alternative for finding consultants who can help you with market research   Survey the Market  If you have a website that gets significant traffic  website polls can be a great way to get quick feedback on what the market thinks  and there are lots of free web polling widgets out there  If you want to talk to people who aren t your customers yet  or if you re targeting a more general population segment  Google consumer surveys lets you spin up a survey fast and collect results for anywhere from  0 10 to  3 00 per

1278,training-dataset/product/542.txt,product,The right way to challenge your competitorsSeth Godin once said   Your fair share isn t going to be yours unless you give the public a reason to pick you   At Intercom our product marketing team has been evaluating a tactic called comparative marketing  The goal  help prospective customers answer the question of how Intercom is different than our competitors  Although this seems straightforward  there is more to successful comparative marketing than meets the eye  At the Inside Intercom World Tour in Boston  I explained what led to our decision to pursue this strategy and shared some research about what makes this work  as well as five things you should consider when doing comparative marketing at your company  You ve probably heard that great products sell themselves  This is a myth  You ve probably heard that great products sell themselves  This is a myth  It s not hard to find examples of better products losing to better marketing strategies  Take a look at the format wars between Betamax and VHS  or more recently between HD DVD and Blu ray  and you can see that having a better product doesn t guarantee you will come out on top  You need more than just a great product to win  and your marketing efforts can play a big role in your success  or lack thereof  At Intercom  marketing has a broad range of responsibilities spanning the customer lifecycle  Our marketing efforts begin at creating initial product awareness then continue all the way to retaining and delighting our customers  As product marketers  our role is to help convince people to buy our products by clearly showing how they can be hired for a Job to be Done  For the past four years this has been our core focus  Our commitment to continuously improving the clarity of our positioning is one of the factors that has helped drive our significant growth   But company growth creates new challenges  One interesting result of our increased brand awareness is a shift in the questions prospects are asking us  We get fewer people wondering what Intercom is or our how our products work  and more folks interested in how we compare to specific competitors  As a product marketing team our job is to provide prospective customers with the information to answer these questions  This led us to evaluate and create comparative marketing assets  What is comparative marketing  Essentially comparative marketing is publicly comparing your product to your competitor s product with the intention of convincing buyers to pick you over them  This tactic can be used to influence a buying decision when someone is either hiring a product for the first time or evaluating a switch from their existing solution  According to Persuasive Advertising by Professor J  Scott Armstrong at Wharton  a meta analysis of 77 empirical studies on the effects of comparative advertising found that this tactic increased a buyer s intent to purchase a product by 22  on average  The best recent example of the impact of comparative marketing comes from Apple s  Get a Mac  campaign  which ran from 2006 to 2009  When Apple launched this campaign their computer sales were on the decline and Macs were getting outsold roughly 60 to 1 by PCs   Then Apple launched  Get a Mac   In the first month of the campaign they sold 200 000 more Macs than the previous month  They ended 2006 with a 39  increase in sales  Adweek named  Get a Mac  the best campaign of the decade  Apple has been eating away at PC s market share ever since   Another interesting thing about comparative marketing is how commonly it s used to influence customers  purchasing decisions outside of software  Literally every day you are exposed to this tactic  SaaS has started employing this strategy too  but not very effectively  Why is SaaS bad at comparative marketing  When evaluating how Intercom should approach comparative marketing we looked to our peers in the SaaS industry for inspiration  However  there was little to be found   I went to dozens of different comparative marketing landing pages and found some version of the image above  Everyone seems to follow the same broken template for creating these pages  create a grid  write down all your features  figure out which features your competitor doesn t have  fudge things to make it look better  and then hand the list to your web developer with the instructions to make the check marks green and Xs red  Do you really expect prospects to be compelled to buy based on a glorified spreadsheet  Features alone won t give most people a clear reason to buy one product over another  This approach lacks honesty and fails to create any emotional response for the reader  In many instances I would go to the competitor s page after viewing one of these comparison tables and find a very similar feature  like the email collector shown above  The explanation for this is either a  the company lacks integrity  knowingly using proprietary feature names to make their product appear different when it isn t  or b  laziness  it was true at one point  but they haven t updated the page to reflect the present circumstances   It s bad either way  but still not the worst part of a feature grid comparison  CEB and Google partnered on a study that found only 14  of B2B buyers see a clear difference when comparing similar B2B products and value that difference enough to pay for it  Basically  features alone won t give most people a clear reason to buy one product over another  The same study also found that 68  of B2B customers would pay more for something they found personal value in  The take away is that how a product makes a buyer feel impacts the purchase decision  With this knowledge  clearly comparative marketing requires more than a feature grid  How do you do comparative marketing well  So how do you do it effectively  Here s how  1  Compare your company to a market leader    Remember the stat from earlier about comparative ads increasing buyer intent to purchase a product by 22   Well there is second very important aspect of this finding  Professor Armstrong found that persuasive ads only increase a buyer s intent to purchase when smaller or newer companies compare themselves against clear market leaders  Do you remember Microsoft s  300M  I m a PC  campaign shown above  Probably not  because comparative marketing doesn t have a positive impact when big companies go after smaller ones  2  Show your damn product Remember the stat from earlier about comparative ads increasing buyer intent to purchase a product by 22   Well there is second very important aspect of this finding  Professor Armstrong found that persuasive ads only increase a buyer s intent to purchase when smaller or newer companies compare themselves against clear market leaders  Do you remember Microsoft s  300M  I m a PC  campaign shown above  Probably not  because comparative marketing doesn t have a positive impact when big companies go after smaller ones  I firmly believe that for a customer to give you their hard earned cash they are going to need to see what it is they are buying  Images and visuals are superior to lists at creating the emotional connection critical to the buying process  Research shows that 65  of all people are visual learners  so images resonate better than words  As humans our visual memory is encoded in the medial temporal lobe of the brain  the same place where emotions are processed  Imagery and feelings are tied together at a physiological level  3  Tell a story A good story should provide your audience with the key bits of information they need to form an accurate judgement about your product and it s ability to solve their Job to be Done  But information alone is not enough  You need to evoke empathy  Paul Zak  a professor at Claremont McKenna College  found stories that evoke empathy cause the brain to synthesize Oxytocin  which has been shown to increase voluntary cooperation  Or put another way  empathy paves the way for a deeper emotional connection that leads to behavior change  In this case that means buying your product instead of someone else s  4  Be engaging This may seem obvious  but for your story to be impactful people need to read it  In addition to having compelling imagery you need to create tension that will hold their interest  An effective way to do that is to show people that your competitor is the  old way  and reveal your solution as  the new way  or the path to a better tomorrow  Setting up a conflict that resonates with your audience s pain and showing you offer a solution to that pain gives you a better chance of holding their attention and influencing their decision to purchase your product  5  Hit all 4 Forces  The ReWired Group  a group of leading Jobs to be Done practitioners  identified 4 Forces at play that influence a customer s decision to switch products  There are two forces pulling prospective customers to your product and two pushing them away  These 4 Forces need to be top of mind when doing comparative marketing because you can manipulate them to lead people to purchase your product and defeat the power of inertia  Here are a few implementation examples  Highlight the limitations of the competitor    In this example Campbell s highlights that Progresso uses MSG  It makes choosing Campbell s a no brainer  When presented with two choices of the same variety of soup a consumer will pick the product that doesn t use ingredients said to cause various health problems  such as headaches  allergic reactions and infantile obesity  Promote how well your product solves a problem    This is crucial  Verizon understands that speed and connectivity are key features of wireless plans  Even at a glance it is obvious that if you want reliable  fast coverage wherever you are Verizon is clearly the choice for you  Assure people that making the switch is quick and easy    Here T mobile focuses on another important feature of a wireless plan  cost  T Mobile gives price sensitive prospects a great reason to dump AT T  Sprint and Verizon  Just bring in your old devices  and they will pay the termination fees for your whole family  Remove consumers irrational attachment to their current situation,"[1278 549 494 365

1282,training-dataset/product/652.txt,product,Successful customer onboarding never stopsAs your product evolves and changes over time  you ll invest money and time in new features  big product launches and expensive release cycles  Despite this  the vast majority of new features flop   because they never get used  Fun fact  when Microsoft asked their users what they wanted added to Office  they found 90  of the requested features were already there  They had just done a terrible job of onboarding the right users on to the right features at the right time  That s because when we think about onboarding we usually don t think beyond signup  In reality  your onboarding is just getting started  You haven t turned users into experts  and they haven t yet given up all the other products they used before yours  As we discuss in our book  Intercom on Onboarding  if you only focus your onboarding efforts on new signups  you re leaving a massive opportunity on the table   passionate  engaged customers   For example  let s say somebody has been using your product for six months  They re totally engaged and up to speed  But then you release a brand new feature that can make them even better  That s an onboarding opportunity right there  Ultimately  the best onboarding retains customers over time by continually showing them how to get the most out of your product  We recently experienced this when we launched our new feature  Smart Campaigns  Front loading your users with information will make sure  they never get past the first few hurdles  We knew it had the potential to improve almost all our customers  definition of success   personal customer communication at scale  This gave us a significant onboarding opportunity   we could deliver more value to our existing customers  The challenge was that Smart Campaigns was not an easy concept to understand  If the beta period taught us one thing  it was that a certain amount of hand holding was required  The easy path would have been to ignore this and send a once off feature announcement email to all our customers  But that meant we risked it becoming a feature only a few customers ever looked at   That s why we set out to carefully and consciously onboard existing users to Smart Campaigns  Our approach was to make just enough information available at every turn  but also stay out of the way  Here s a few ways we did that  Onboard in context It s a common mistake for companies to launch features in products without any context  Your goal should never be just  get it launched   Your goal is  get it used   That s why the right time to promote an improvement is not only when someone is in your product  but when they re in a position to use it  For Smart Campaigns  we announced the new feature to customers when they arrived in the messaging area of Intercom  via an in app announcement  That message contained a video with a high level overview of the feature and instructions to get started  Like all good onboarding messaging  it s closely modeled on just in time information   teach in the moment when specific information is actually useful   Use educational content to onboard When explaining new concepts  it s important to give users a sense of what success looks like  It s a familiar technique used in onboarding   giving users educational content as a blank slate  Take Trello  for example  Users are given a welcome board with pre made to do cards  with each card explaining a different interaction  They use content and the interface to teach you how to use the product  Not only is it a great way of providing a warm and human experience to your product  it encourages action and tees your customers up for success from the word go  This is a far better approach than saying   Your campaign is empty and that s all I m going to say   You would never say that in person to your customer  so why say it in your product  When a customer encounters a campaign for the first time  there is an example campaign created when they get there   with best practice tips and links to helpful guides  Then  when a customer creates a new campaign  and sees a blank campaign for the first time  we signpost them to a guide for creating engaging messages  This is easily dismissed  but it s helpful content in the right place at the right time for those who need it  Anticipate the next questions In education  the more you hold someone s hand  the less their brain will engage  The same goes for onboarding   if you keep spoonfeeding users solutions  don t be surprised when they can t pick up a knife and fork  That s why it s better to give information as gradual hints  so new users can more deeply retain what they ve learned  One of the best ways to do this is to center information around the intent of the customer  For example  when a customer creates a new campaign  by clicking on the create button they ve shown intent  With new users interested  now is a good time to start sharing more advanced information like best practice guides  This type of careful consideration really does drive engagement  Gradually expose features over time Onboarding users to a new feature requires the same skill as onboarding them to a new product  You wouldn t welcome new users to your product by asking them to do complex tasks only a pro user would be able to do  So don t overload users when you re onboarding them to a new feature either  Think about a game like Super Mario Bros  At any given point  only the necessary parts of the game are on screen  allowing players to gradually and naturally understand what s going on around them  As you make progress  only the next piece of relevant information is exposed  Imagine you saw the entire level as soon as you started playing  Front loading your users with information will make sure they never get past the first few hurdles  For example  Intercom users don t need to know about our keyboard shortcuts until they ve been in the inbox for a while and have started to deal with a heavy load of user conversations  It s certainly not a day one announcement  Similarly they probably don t care about our bulk data export feature until they re tracking a bunch of data,"[1214 1282 999 709 222 1239 322 244 353 790 325]"
1332,training-dataset/business/908.txt,business,It s Price Before Product  Period Over the second half of the 1990s  Porsche hatched plans for a new car  Annual sales were a third of what they d been the decade prior  so the company badly needed a turnaround  The car hit the market in 2003  A decade later  Porsche sold 100 000 of the model in one year   nearly five times as many as it did in its launch year   which accounted for half the company s total profit  This enabled Porsche to eventually pay down its debt  increase its cash reserves and generate the highest profit per car in the automobile industry  What was this impactful  new product   It wasn t a sports car  for which Porsche is famed   not  for example  the sexy Porsche 911 that can effortlessly hit 200mph  Instead  it was the Cayenne  Porsche s family friendly SUV  How did the carmaker find this degree of impact with a vehicle so counterintuitive to its brand  In this case  it wasn t Porsche s engineering prowess or manufacturing efficiency  but how it designed the car around what customers needed  valued and were willing to pay for   in short  around its price   Building around price is the best path forward according to Madhavan Ramanujam  a board member and partner at consultancy Simon Kucher   Partners  When it comes to this pricing expert  investor Bill Gurley may capture it best  Madhavan Ramanujam is to monetization strategy what Bob Marley is to reggae music  He s managed over 125 projects for companies ranging from hot startups to the Fortune 500  many of which he writes about in his recently published book Monetizing Innovation  He advises companies on several topics including new product monetization  acquisition and growth strategy  pricing strategy  packaging and bundling strategies  and price implementation  He s essentially the price whisperer   Drawing from his talk at First Round s CEO Summit  Madhavan Ramanujam explains why pricing is so paramount from the get go and the four ways companies often trip up when trying to monetize  He also shares the three guidelines that startups should follow in order to properly design and price their products  Let s get started   Why Pricing is Key From The Get Go  Porsche knew it was taking a tremendous risk by building an SUV  veering from its traditional wheelhouse of sports cars  So the company focused on benefits customers were willing to pay for  The result was a car perfectly designed around features customers wanted  like larger cup holders  at a price they were willing to pay  All the items customers weren t willing to pay for  like Porsche s famous six speed racing transmission  were thrown out  even if their engineers loved them   On the other hand  Fiat Chrysler in 2009 badly needed a hit in the compact cars category  and focused its development process on engineering and design  settling on a price for the car at the very end  The company even bragged in advertisements that  it was  kicking out the finance guys  from the development process  They worked to design  build and rethink  and repeated that cycle over and over until engineering thought the product was good to go  Money was not an issue and compromise was not an option  The ad shows the company building prototype after prototype to get it right   Ramanujam says   Market performance was a disaster  It performed so poorly it eventually forced the company to issue temporary layoffs  Even though Fiat Chrysler was six times larger than Porsche  the company failed to craft a hit  That s because the company thought about product first and price last     On the other hand  Porsche s masterstroke was thinking about monetization long before product development for the SUV was in full speed  then designing a car with the value and features customers wanted the most  around a price that made sense  The result was total corporate alignment  Porsche knew it had a winner  and had the confidence to invest accordingly   Ramanujam says   Porsche is not an outlier  The vast majority of companies are under some kind of price pressure  and need to create new products and features   and make money off of them  in order to survive  In a 2014 study conducted by Simon Kutcher  about 80  of respondents said they were under price pressure  About 60  even said they were in a price war  The top way companies planned to respond to price pressure was to release new products and services in order to survive  according to this study  And yet 72  of these innovations did not meet their revenue or profit targets  or even failed completely  Why   Why Monetization Often Fails  New products fail for many reasons   But the root of all innovation evil is the failure to put the customer s willingness to pay  WTP  for a new product at the very core of product design  Most companies postpone pricing decisions until after the product is developed  They embark on a long  costly journey of hoping they ll make money rather than knowing they will   Ramanujam says   You can ensure your product not only stays alive  but thrives  by talking with customers early in the product development process  If you don t  you won t be able to prioritize the product features you develop  or know whether you re building something customers will pay for until it s in the marketplace    Drill down to see what customers are willing to pay early on  It ll drastically increase your odds of success   Missteps with monetization frequently occur when companies try to sell a product that they haven t price tested thoroughly in advance  Take the Keurig Kold  a  370 home soda machine  or the  personal transporter  Segway  Mess ups on monetization usually boil down to misjudgments on price point  features and market  According to Ramanujam  here s the four ways companies get tripped up  and how to avoid them   Feature Shock  These happen when a product has been packed with far too many features   Products fail when they have way too much going on  They re over engineered  hard to explain  nothing stands out  and the company puts a price on it and hopes for the best  It s usually borne of a sincere effort to be  all things to all people   resulting in a product that pleases few  Due to its multitude of features   none of them a standout   these products are costly to make  over engineered and usually overpriced   Ramanujam says   Take Amazon s Fire Phone  The company  already the successful maker of gadgets like the Kindle  decided to launch a feature packed phone that had four cameras  facial recognition technology and 3D effects  as well as Firefly  a shopping feature that let you buy a product by pointing the camera at it  Reviewers panned the phone and sales struggled  leading to a  170 million write down largely attributed to the unsold inventory   How to combat feature shock  Beware when your R D team wants to add a feature but can t articulate its value to a customer  Instead of cramming tons of features into one product  practice restraint  Separate your customers into buckets depending on their needs  values and WTP  Then tailor your products differently to each segment  Essentially  you want to sort features into different groups and create packages or bundles that appeal to each    Curb your instincts to please customers by giving away too much value unless people will pay for it  This will maximize the potential of your new products   Ramanujam says   And get comfortable with the idea of giving your price sensitive segment only basic quality and service levels  rather than giving them everything  Product configuration requires the guts to take away features    Take the case of Microsoft  It has different versions of its Office suite  so that different groups of customers   business  home and education   find options best suited to its needs  It s been a highly successful approach   Minivations  Sometimes  companies will create the right product for the right market  The only catch  The company or entrepreneur didn t have the courage to charge the right price  and as a result  the product is under monetized  If you evaluate the product s sales versus its potential  and it gets a C   that s a minivation    Everyone knows that they could have done better  but they just claim it as a success because it still worked  Take the computer manufacturer Asus  It unveiled a mini notebook in 2008 priced at  299 that sold out in a few days  Demand exceeded supply by 900   Asus couldn t make them fast enough and lost significant revenue once its supply ran dry   Ramanujam says   The Asus product fell far short of its price potential  it was way underpriced  Asus left lots of profit on the table  They could have priced a lot higher  serviced the market that was willing to pay  and then dropped the price after building far more units to target the mass market    How to catch minivations  Look for minivations early  It s key to watch your team s attitude before and after the product launches   Some early warning signs may be that your team seems comfortable checking the box and lowballing on targets  There s a lack of ambition and a desire not to overprice   Ramanujam says   Your sales team is going to be your canary in the coal mine  They will be easily meeting its targets with your new products  Your channel partners will be reaping their maximum margins  Sellouts will be popping up  If the majority of deals are going through the pipeline without any pushback on price  you may have underpriced it  Track the number of price escalations  as well as the length of the sales cycle against historical norms  It will give you more hard evidence that something new is occurring  which you can then address    Hidden Gem  Hidden gems are products that a company should have developed  but didn t because it goes against the grain of what it normally offers  Take Kodak as an example   The company in 1974 had digital photography technology  but didn t release it because they were concerned about cannibalizing their existing business  Kodak didn t introduce its first digital camera until 1995  21 years after the fact  They declared bankruptcy in 2012   says Ramanujam   None of this had to happen  Kodak s team became complacent about their firm s successful  pre existing business model  and the company stagnated    How to harness hidden gems  The big miss with hidden gems lies in failing to recognize the value and often disruptive power they represent   These ideas often never make it to the executive suite  They are stopped by mid level executives who are either unable to see their potential or are scared of them  A more open culture could save these ideas from being lost too early   Ramanujam says    Where does the buck stop   becomes a tough question to answer in the case of hidden gems  Who was responsible for the big miss  In most organizations  no one is responsible for recognizing the hidden gem s potential    Your company may have hidden gems lying around if you are going through any of these inflection points   Changes in business model  Disruption in your industry  Differentiation of an existing commodity business  A change from selling a product to a service  A shift from offline to online business  A move from analog to digital  A switch from hardware to software   The key here is to be very careful and mindful when you re going through these big organizational changes  You don t want a great idea to get lost in the shuffle  and you also don t want to see great ideas killed by middle management  The key is grooming a culture where ideas are heard and taken seriously   Ramanujam says   Undead  This category of product should never be released  because it comes back to haunt you  like a ghost or zombie   They come in two varieties  Either they re the wrong answer to the right question  or an answer to a question no one cares about  Either way  you should never have developed these products  Undead failures teach us that some well intentioned  marvelously engineered new products should never be brought to life   says Ramanujam   One of the most celebrated   and then reviled   was the Segway  It was supposed to change the world  But sales underperformed in a major way  and one of the top problems with the machine was price  At  3 000  7 000 each  there was little hope for a mass following    How to avoid the undead  Undead products happen when proponents wildly overstate customer appeal and don t segment the customer base effectively   Had these firms asked customers whether and what they d be willing to pay for their inventions before drafting the engineering plans  and had they identified the market size by segment and who would be willing to pay the most and the least for it  they would have reformulated their products to meet an acceptable price  Or  finding there is no acceptable price  or that the market size is too small  they would have scrapped the product altogether before they incurred too much financial damage   Ramanujam says   A critical step in your new product development process will be making a business case for it   by getting external input  Specifically  you need to know your target customer s WTP  Your business case document should be an up to the moment reflection of your product s monetization potential    Slapping on a price just before going to market is a recipe for failure  But many commit this crime   Three Key Rules For Monetizing New Products  The most successful innovators start by understanding their customers needs and developing products around what they are willing to pay to address those needs  It s not enough just to think about price beforehand   you have to iterate and test your assumptions and talk to buyers at length to truly understand whether your product has a shot  There are several different monetization strategies  and one key thing Ramanujam stresses is that all customers are not the same  Every situation requires a different strategy  Below  he lays out three ways to price your products properly   Have the Willingness to Pay talk early   Talk about price early in the product development process  About 80  of companies don t do this   and instead wait until the last minute   according to Simon Kucher s study    Ask at the onset whether or not people would pay for the product you intend to develop  This is the Willingness to Pay talk   Ramanujam argues   Frontloading this question is powerful because customers won t be in the mindset of negotiating price  Instead  they ll give you objective feedback that you can use to prioritize what you re building    Ask someone if they like a product  Then ask them if they like it at a price point  say  20  The whole conversation changes   Ramanujam often sees teams put an intense amount of effort into new product features without considering whether customers will be willing to pay for them   I remember one time when a CEO asked his team to figure out what they could monetize  It ended up that the features lower on their list were what customers were actually interested in paying for  If they hadn t done this sort of exercise  they would have focused their time and attention on all the features  and probably produced a mediocre product  What they were actually able to do was take the ones that really mattered and do a kickass job   says Ramanujam   Here s how to get started  Before investing in your product  directly ask your customer what they re willing to pay   but do it in a smart way  Present the item and ask   What do you think is an acceptable price for this innovation   What is an expensive price for this innovation   What is a prohibitively expensive price for this innovation    After you ask the first question  they ll give you a low ball price  Then they ll give you the ceiling and the cut off point  These are three very powerful data points   says Ramanujam  Here s what each data point tells you   The acceptable price   Based on working with hundreds of companies  here s what we ve learned  An acceptable price is the price that people are super comfortable paying  No friction  they just love your pricing because it s a steal  If you re pricing for growth  maybe you can price in the acceptable area    The expensive price   Expensive is the price that they would actually pay you  but they don t like it  Neither do they hate it  but it s the price usually that s aligned with value    The prohibitive price   The prohibitively expensive is the price that they ll pretty much be laughing you out of the room  Asking that question gives you some sense of where you can actually be someday  but not at the moment    Consider doing a large scale study with these questions  Plotting out what customers find acceptable  expensive and prohibitively expensive gives you a graphical view of their willingness to pay  and allows you to identify  price cliffs   where demand drops off due to price   There are psychological thresholds that people have when they think about your product  If you price at  51 as opposed to  49 99  suddenly there s a huge portion of people who think that price is not acceptable  This is how psychological behavioral price points are determined  with these simple questions  which you can do tomorrow   Ramanujam says   Knowing the answers to these questions is critical  If you didn t know this you wouldn t be able to really price your products the right way  It ll give you a range of the WTP for your product  far before it s commercialized and released in the market  And you will know that you have a monetizing potential and you will not be hoping   Investigate How You Charge As Much as What You Charge  Ramanujam stresses the importance of charging in a way that makes sense and is appealing to the customer   and it s not just about the price point  For example Michelin in the early 2000s came up with an innovation that made truck tires last 20  longer   But the head of sales predicted Michelin could only charge a few percentage points more for the new tires  And given that the new tires would last longer  they would reduce customer demand by 20   So Michelin s executives revisited the company s long established monetization model   Ramanujam says   The new model they came up with turned out to be as big a breakthrough as its longer lasting tires  Charging trucking fleets by the mileage they drove their Michelin tires  not by the number of tires bought  The result was a model that allowed fleet managers to pay for performance and flexibly manage costs  For example  they would pay less for the tires in the event of an economic slowdown  when there would be less demand for trucking  And Michelin could generate 20  more revenue more per tire if they lasted 20  longer  The company wound up having the biggest profits in the industry    Here s how to get started  There are several ways to charge   whether that s a subscription model  dynamic pricing that fluctuates based on factors such as season and weather or a freemium pricing  To figure out what s best  consider how likely your customers are to accept the model    Is your model predictable  flexible  fair and transparent enough for your particular customer base  Customers almost always have preferences  so make sure you re serving them  Also make sure you do scenario planning to understand how future developments would impact the model  and factor in what your competitors are doing  The reason to ask this question is not to mimic your rivals  monetization approaches but to set yourself apart   Ramanujam says   Assess factors like feasibility  difficulty of customer adoption and scalability  You absolutely must be able to communicate the model easily to customers and partners  And don t count out technology   the rapid evolution of the Internet and other tech has created tons of opportunity for creating monetization models that are new to your industry    Sometimes the best product innovation is the monetization model itself   Don t settle for a one size fits all solution   Your customers are not homogenous  so your product shouldn t be  either  Instead  create different versions of your product to match your major customer segments  This principle even applies to a staple like water  Ramanujam says   If it s in a fountain it s free  if you put it in a bottle it s  2  if you put gas in it s  2 50  if you put in a minibar it s  5  It s the same water   he says   Your customers are different  They have different needs  they have different values  and they have different WTP  The only way to cope with this is to embrace customer segmentation    Rather than build one product for the entire market  package and bundle different products for specific segments  For example   People who want the best product  People who want it now  People who just want the normal version  People who are very price sensitive  Here s how to get started   When it comes to innovation  there s only one right way to segment  by customers  needs  what they value and their WTP for a product or service that delivers that value  Use segmentation as a guiding influence  starting in the R D stage   be constantly exploring customer needs  values and WTP   Ramanujam says  He cites GPS device maker Garmin  which created different products for drivers  golfers  runners  hikers and bikers  Drivers  for example  got traffic updates in their device  while golfers got data on their distance from the hole and tips on sand and water bodies to avoid   These are the principles Ramanujam says are key to segmentation   Start with customer WTP data  Cluster individuals according to their WTP  value and needs data  You ll discover your segments this way   Don t be beholden to stats   The most statistically significant outcome might not give you a segment strategy that will work in practice  Ask yourself  Are there clear fences between segments   features one segment strongly wants but others don t  Have you defined a customer group  The acid test is asking your salespeople whether they can sort their clients into the segments you ve come up with   Ramanujam says   Fewer is more  Start with 3 4 segments  then expand gradually until you reach the optimal number   The fewer segments you have  the less homogeneous and distinct they will be  the more segments  the higher the complexity  Do not underestimate the latter  Serving each new segment adds significant complexity for sales  marketing and other functions   Ramanujam says   Don t try to serve every segment  Use what s called market sizing to make sure a segment will deliver you enough money to make it worth it  Estimate how many customers you can acquire and keep  and at what prices  then separate out the attractive segments from the ones that don t make business sense   You re not obligated to serve every possible customer  The products and services you develop should match your company s overall financial and commercial goals   Ramanujam says   Describe the segments so you can address them  Make sure each segment has observable criteria for customizing your sales and marketing messages   This is critical  In writing TV commercials  Internet banner ads  or any other marketing and sales messages  companies must describe their target segments as precisely as possible   Ramanujam says   There s not a single market where customer needs are homogeneous  Yet again and again  companies design products for the  average  customer   A Final Word on Pricing  At the end of the day  designing around price will get you the furthest of any strategy  That s because it forces you to think early and often about what your customers value  and what features   or tiers of features   will maximize your success  Without a price  you don t have a product  Be careful not to overload your products with features customers don t want  or build services people don t actually care about  Designing around price also means you need to talk about it early and often with customers  Find out what their psychological cliffs are at different levels of pricing  be inventive around how you charge and segment customers into different buckets depending on their wants  needs and WTPs  This is the only way you can bulletproof the success of your new product    You can build products  slap on a price and hope to monetize  or you can design your products around the price  and craft a thoughtful  successful launch  Provide your customers with products that meet their needs  their values and their WTP  Otherwise  you risk launching duds loaded with features customers don t want or aren t willing to pay for   Ramanujam says   If your company s innovation process is built on hope   a gut instinct before you bring your products to market that they will pay off   you ve made the wrong choice  Even if this process has worked before  you re building products on a tenuous foundation  If you want to transition from hoping to knowing your product will be successful  make price your core focus,"[1332 1231 1202 703 155 1160 459

1338,training-dataset/product/543.txt,product,12 steps to create a great messaging strategyAn effective messaging strategy is the bedrock upon which you can build customer engagement   Unless your customers value what you say  any attempt to persuade  educate  or motivate them to use your product will likely fail  They will either mentally or literally unsubscribe from you  and you ll lose the opportunity to engage them in any way   If your message isn t sent to the right audience it ll feel like spam  to whoever  gets it   To create a message strategy that has real impact  ask yourself these 12 questions each time you send a message  Answer all 12  and you can be sure you re sending the right message in the right tone to the right person at the right time through the right medium   1  What s the context   We ve all been handed a flyer on the street for a restaurant we ll never eat at  It s irritating  Not because the restaurant is offering a bad deal  It s because a flyer about pizza doesn t matter when we ve just filled up on sushi  These messages are totally out of place and appear downright rude   But imagine if they were always accurate  if you only got the flyer when you were hungry and looking for pizza  Carry on imagining  This level of accuracy isn t possible out on the street  But it is possible for your customers inside your product   Context is king for communication  so think carefully about your customers  environment  location  and activity   2  Who is the audience   If your message isn t sent to the right audience it ll feel like spam to whoever gets it  It s mostly common sense  Don t send your long time users a welcome message  Don t promote feature X to users if they re already paying for and using it  Don t contact your freemium users for feedback about your paid features  Don t invite customers from California to your meetup in New York  You get the point   This kind of customer targeting is simple with Intercom  You can drill into your userbase to identify the exact groups of users to talk to  Targeting a smaller group means you ll get fewer replies  but your message will make more sense to more people  so you ll see higher open  click and reply rates  better quality responses  and fewer negative responses   3  What should trigger the message   Maybe you want to send the message to everyone 7 days after they sign up  but only if they re paying you more than  50 dollars per month  Or maybe you only want to talk to customers on your free plan living in the US  You can trigger messages based on any combination of your users  attributes   But what about their behavior  Intercom lets you easily track your users behaviour as Events  You can automatically send them messages as soon as these Events happen  Here are some examples   If a user has just upgraded to your max plan  it s the perfect time to send them a thank you message   If you re looking for feedback on a feature  ask your customers as soon as they use it  But perhaps you want to wait until the tenth time to ask them  because you want feedback from more experienced users   If someone was using your key feature every day  but hasn t used it for 30 days  it s a good time to check in to see if everything is ok   Combine as many user attributes and behaviors as necessary to get this right   4  Where should they receive the message   In app messages perform better than email   they re up to ten times better than email at engaging your customers  It s because they feel personal and targeted  and they re in context  We use in app messages for onboarding our new customers  promoting different parts of Intercom  getting feedback  and announcing things in context e g   We ve just redesigned our Messenger    You should target your messages by page  too  If you re sending a message about changes to your settings  it makes sense to say it when they visit the settings page  Targeting URLs like this is easy in Intercom   But when does email make sense  Emails can still be targeted to the right user  and can be timed correctly  too  But the problem with email is that it s rarely in context  It makes no sense to ask your users for feedback about your sign up process 2 weeks after they sign up  3 hours after they shut your app down  and while they re checking their email on the bus ride home   Email does still have it s place  though  And the key advantage it has over in apps is that you can guarantee your customers will receive it  There s no guarantee an in app message will be sent  they re only triggered if a user logs into your app   That s why email is best for critical communications  At Intercom we use it for billing  re engagement  and one off  time sensitive announcements  e g   Today we launched our new product  Educate     Push notifications are the third channel to consider here  Like email  they re not inside your product  but they re more disruptive  Our approach at Intercom with push notifications is conservative  Again  the more personal you are the better  if Facebook send me a generic push notification to tell me to add more friends  it s spam  But if they tell me that Brian has replied to my message  I m interested   5  What s the business goal of this message   It can be tempting to tell your users about every new feature  blog post  or offer  Don t  You might have a whole bunch of things you want to ask your users   how is feature X doing  or what features are missing  But there s a fine line between an optimised  helpful message schedule  and one that feels like spam  By limiting the volume of your outbound communication  you re forced to be exact with the scheduling and content of each message   Here at Intercom  each message we send has a specific goal  For example  our welcome message invites customers to a demo  which in turn reduces support requests  and the likelihood that they ll churn  And our re engagement emails are designed to increase sessions by users who have quit Intercom   6  When did you last contact this user   Getting more than one message in quick succession feels like spam  regardless of the content  If your all important product announcement arrives at the same time as your less important  but equally attention grabbing research question  both messages will have less impact,"[1338 790 322 1214 1282 160 888 864 101 431 32]"
1364,training-dataset/product/1.txt,product,Prioritizing product announcements in a SaaS worldWhen everything you ship presents a marketing opportunity  there s a tendency to announce everything  Don t do it  We ve all heard the motto   if you build it  they will come   While it might be true for some  it s not true for everyone  Announce it  and more will come The reality is great marketing  paired with great product  can equal more than the sum of its parts  I m a big believer that marketing can amplify everything your product team builds  Why  Well  we ve seen it first hand at Intercom with more than 12X growth in new signups since we first invested in marketing in March 2014   While they re certainly not the only driver  product announcements have been a primary contributor to this new phase of growth for Intercom  It s one of the reasons we treat everything we ship as a marketing opportunity  Continuous shipping   endless opportunities As our VP of Engineering Darragh would say  shipping is your company s heartbeat  It touches all parts of your company  as do its benefits  and the behaviors it enables and encourages  like team morale  motivation  and momentum  It also presents marketing opportunities  every time you ship   The key word here is opportunity  because having more opportunities presents a challenge in itself  It s a new challenge brought upon marketers by SaaS  Endless opportunities   new challenges Before the days of SaaS  opportunities to make an announcement were typically limited to your product team s release cycle  As a result  big investments were made in announcing big  dot releases   Whether you were announcing version 1 0  1 1  or 2 0  your challenge was to construct a narrative that made sense and told a compelling story about a collection of new features and improvements that more often than not didn t quite make sense all together  Product managers were pushing  and at times competing  to get their features out in time before the next  ship  left  At the same time  marketing was desperate to have something to talk about  It s hardly surprising that the big release rarely offered a clear and logical story   SaaS changed all of this  Although you no longer have to tell all the stories at once  the challenge instead is being thoughtful about the stories you do want to tell  Deciding what to announce Last year alone we shipped more than 100 new features and improvements to Intercom  That presented us with more than 100 marketing opportunities  Here s just a few   We communicate all these updates and new features via our changes page  It s an easy way for us to keep people aware of all the extra value we re adding to Intercom  and do so in a pretty non interruptive way   But we know instinctively that a major new feature like Smart Campaigns deserves more attention than something like an integration with a third party service  If we treated everything equally and tried to shout about each and every thing  people would simply stop listening to us  Just like when your smoke alarm won t stop beeping  and you take the batteries out to make it stop  It s a bad idea  It s all about prioritization We ve created a simple framework to help us to decide what we announce  and how  On one axis you have value   is the change most valuable to existing customers  or does it have the potential to attract new customers  On the other  you have innovation   are you playing catch up to existing products on the market  or is this an entirely new solution to a problem that people have   P1s  These are your big announcements  The new features that solve problems in entirely new and better ways  They present the biggest opportunity for you to attract new customers  so you want to be sure to shout about them   These are your big announcements  The new features that solve problems in entirely new and better ways  They present the biggest opportunity for you to attract new customers  so you want to be sure to shout about them  P2s  These are new solutions to problems that are mostly valuable to your existing customers  They re powerful features  but by themselves  they are unlikely to convince a new customer to use your product over an existing solution   These are new solutions to problems that are mostly valuable to your existing customers  They re powerful features  but by themselves  they

your product up to par with competitors  Existing customers have likely been asking for it  but it wasn t blocking a sale  There are times when you ll ship a feature your competitors already have and are blocking prospective customers from using your product  These features present an opportunity to attract new customers  so we treat them as P2s too  Mapping prioritization to tactics Understanding the priority of an announcement will help you understand what level of effort and investment you should make in announcing it  For us  we map each priority to a set of tactics,"[1364 1253 1282 1214

1389,training-dataset/business/590.txt,business,How customer support fits your businessIn the not too distant past  customer support was seen as a hassle  a cost that had to be borne but which was really just a tax on success  If it wasn t for those pesky customers with problems  profits would be through the roof  right  There is no escaping the fact that supporting your customers costs money  But if you look at the broader financial models of customer support  you ll see that support isn t just a cost center  but a strategic investment that increases customer retention and reduces churn  COGS and the real costs of customer support The costs associated with providing support to your customers are known as Cost of Goods Sold  aka COGS  For traditional industries such as manufacturing  COGS are made up of the physical costs incurred in selling your product  But as SaaS businesses are treated as service businesses  COGS represent the costs of providing that service to your customers  Such as  Hosting  Other third party costs e g  content delivery networks  software  etc  Customer onboarding costs  Support team costs  including personnel  Hosting and other infrastructure costs are relatively fixed   each additional customer doesn t move the needle   so support costs are the easiest way to increase or reduce COGS  Here s a simple way to think about COGS in the SaaS world  If you stopped signing up new customers in the morning  stopped shipping new product  but continued to serve your existing ones  what costs would be incurred in keeping the lights on  That s COGS   it s key to telling you if your business fundamentals are sound  For today s SaaS companies  COGS  and by proxy support  is a key component of profitability for SaaS companies   There are two implications of this  If you want healthy financials your support team is always going to be busy  No matter how much you value your customers  you can t cut an open ended check for support  Cutting support to the bone to increase profits might look tempting in the short term  but bad support will only lead to increased churn  eroding your profits just as quickly as you increased them  The number one reason customers quit is when they believe a company no longer cares about them So  how can you better understand your ability to spend on support  Economies of scale  your position in the market  and your pricing should influence the way you think about spending on support  Here are few examples  Pricing Why can Apple afford to provide much better support than Dell  It s price  A similarly specced computer from Apple and Dell will not be priced the same and may even vary by orders of magnitude  Put simply  the more you can charge for your product  the more support you can afford to provide  But figuring out how to charge more isn t easy  In SaaS specifically  the more you can charge while not negatively impacting your retention rate proportionally  the more you can spend on support  Economies of scale Imagine you are running a fictitious product management application that sells access to its product on a per seat basis  Each additional seat sold costs you almost nothing from an infrastructure perspective  Assuming you re using third parties like Amazon Web Services and reserving instances along the way  the more seats you sell  the lower the marginal costs to host each additional seat  As hosting costs per seat decrease  you can increase your support spend per seat while maintaining the same gross profit margin  Your place in the market It s a simple fact that larger  more valuable customers will churn less  It s more expensive and difficult to land them  often with involvement from the sales team  product and engineering teams to answer build specific requests  your CEO  etc    but once you ve landed them they re much less likely to quit  Their switching costs are higher  They ve invested more of their time  money  resources  and reputation to adopt your product  In contrast smaller customers adopt the product quickly and cost much less to acquire  However  it s much easier for them to quit  Their switching costs are much lower  and it s also statistically more likely they go out of business  This natural difference in retention across markets will completely change your lifetime value  LTV  equation and dictate how much you can spend to support customers  Said another way  an hour spent with a larger  higher retention customer makes up a much smaller portion of that customer s LTV than it does with a smaller customer  If you want to treat all customers as equal go ahead and do it  But be clear about the trade offs you are making when you decide to do that  From cost centre to profit centre But rather than simply looking at the cost of support  consider how support can actually be a positive force on revenue  Here s just three ways you can use customer support to grow your business  Support to convert If you provide support to customers on free trials you need to think about what s a sales cost and what s actually customer support  If you are supporting free users to convert them to paying customers then it s a sales cost  If someone is on a trial of a  25 000 a month plan and they have a question three days in  is that actually COGS or is it a sales cost  It s sales because if the potential customer doesn t get what they want they are not going to buy the product  It s not COGS because you haven t actually sold a good yet  Support to preserve,"[1389 1247 10 756 328 1014 1164 1026 1058 704 384]"

1417,training-dataset/product/87.txt,product,The product roadmap that boosts innovationI wish I could say I invented the following approach to product roadmapping   But the reality is that I m not the first product manager who tried planning with quarterly and feature roadmaps before coming to the conclusion that there s no room for product innovation here   I m also not the first to realize that you need more space and flexibility to lead a product than a feature roadmap can give you   When I came around planning with the simple card based roadmap known as theme based roadmapping  it was because it just made sense   Theme based roadmapping isn t a methodology  so it doesn t force you to follow any particular set of rules  It wasn t invented by a company  so it doesn t force you to work with any particular software or product   It s simply an approach to product strategy that looks like this   And talks like this    Hey  we don t know what the future holds  So this is an outline of what we d like to do  and we ll fill in the blanks as we go    But what s there to love  Well  this open ended approach creates space for the experimentation  collaboration  and creativity that make truly innovative product solutions possible   Related  How to move from imitation to innovation  Theme based roadmaps start with a problem statement and move towards a solution  rather than start with features and struggle to keep up with a far more rigid roadmap   It s freedom from dates and dependencies on a flexible document that you can bend as much as you need to solve customer problems and meet your goals   Theme based roadmapping is essentially a plan for figuring out the plan a perfect way to make space for a breakthrough   In this post  I ll show you how it works and how to use it to surface your best product ideas for your roadmap   What is a theme based roadmap   Theme based roadmapping reflects the way a healthy organization works by establishing clear priorities that everyone at the company can understand so everyone can work towards the same goal   What problems do you want to solve right away  What do you want to achieve now  What could wait until later   Each column of the roadmap represents a time horizon  communicating the rough order of your priorities   Current  Stuff that you re currently working on Near term  Stuff that s coming up soon Future  Stuff that you d like to work on in the future  but need to do a bit more research before you move it forward  You can have more columns if you want  and you can label them as you wish  Our own roadmap consists of 3 columns  but Slack has 5   Each card stands for a theme  or problem you want to solve  You can shift these cards around when your business priorities change and they most certainly will   This gives you a great deal of flexibility to push a card up when your customer feedback shows that what you thought was a small problem is actually affecting your entire user base  It lets you push up and prioritize a major project because you ve finally managed to put a team together around it   So for example  let s say you ve been wanting to overhaul your digest emails  high impact  high effort  but you just haven t had the resources for it  But then you hire an email specialist  That means you can move that task straight to the top of your priorities   Conversely  if you realize the scope of a problem is bigger than you can handle right now  you can move it down your priorities   Now let s take a closer look at how to actually define these themes   Define roadmap themes by sniffing out the root of the problem  The best place to start setting out themes is by looking at your product backlog and your stream of customer feedback for clues    Product managers usually have hundreds of things on this sort of list  somewhere in Excel  of feature requests or feature ideas that they try their best to prioritize   says product consultant Bruce McCarthy    But they haven t usually gone and dug underneath the request to understand the real underlying need  to understand the problem that the customer wants solved    When people give their inputs whether users or colleagues they tend to offer you symptoms and pain points    It s hard to tell if I m putting an item in my wishlist or in my shopping cart     I didn t get a notification email after I made my purchase     Why can t I pay with PayPal    Each of these at face value adds up to a lot of little fixes  But if you dig in to find the root of the problem  you ll see a theme emerge  Your checkout process isn t working   So the question you ask yourself isn t  What odds and ends can we deliver on to improve our checkout process    The better question is   How can we best approach our checkout process to benefit a maximum number of users    Themes represent the underlying problem you really want to solve for your users   Your precision around this knowing exactly where your users are struggling or what they want to achieve is more than half the battle   As McCarthy says   A bunch of the little onesie twosie type of requests like   Move this button  or change this color   will all evaporate from your list of 150 things to do  because you solved that one underlying need that you didn t know existed    Explore many possible solutions to a single problem  The exciting thing about understanding the root problem really well first  is that now you can get creative about how you might solve it   No idea is too big or ridiculous  It s all about creating choices and thinking outside the box so you re not using your time and resources to deliver myopic solutions   It s at this  divergent thinking  stage that Spotify came up with its popular Discover Weekly  It s how Facebook s Newsfeed became a thing  It s how we at ProdPad ended up building the customer feedback tool we had once said we never would   Each of these features were a departure from linear thinking  and the risk paid off  Facebook s move from simple  static profiles to the real time Newsfeed was a radical approach to solve a user engagement problem  Today  it s the company s defining feature   Let s think about everyday problem solving  Say your customers are suggesting that you need some  social stuff  in your app  Here are the kind of questions you might ask yourself to figure it out   Are a lot of customers asking for it  Is it something that would help you meet your business goals  Your most vocal customers might make you feel like a problem is bigger than it is  while a silent majority is perfectly happy with how things are  Is this issue really a deal breaker or a nice to have for a minority of customers   Your most vocal customers might make you feel like a problem is bigger than it is  while a silent majority is perfectly happy with how things are  Is this issue really a deal breaker or a nice to have for a minority of customers  If you don t offer social sharing options today  how are users solving the problem right now  Look to their current behavior for clues  Do they copy paste links into tweets manually  What are they linking to  Maybe they aren t trying to solve it at all  which indicates that it might not be as big a priority as you think it is   Look to their current behavior for clues  Do they copy paste links into tweets manually  What are they linking to  Maybe they aren t trying to solve it at all  which indicates that it might not be as big a priority as you think it is  Why do they want to share it  What do they expect to get out of it  Why do they think it s important for their social circles  You might realize that no one actually wants to share something as publicly as a tweet  They would rather just send it to individual friends or family via FB Messenger or Whatsapp   As you converge onto a solution  your theme based roadmap makes any idea genuinely possible as long as it aligns with your product strategy   Just pop them under your roadmap card and keep rolling   Final thoughts  Successful products don t succeed because they build incrementally better features they succeed because they solve problems in the best way possible   This is why you should pay attention to theme based roadmapping it gives you the superpower to rally your entire organization around your best ideas   Here s what you ve always known  There are no benefits to building features before you know what the problem really is  You don t score points for trying to predict the future on your product roadmap   Your real advantage is building up an ability to observe and reconcile what your users need with what s viable for your company  and aligning every team at your company to work towards that outcome   Gantt chart roadmaps and feature roadmap planning can t hold a candle to this kind of agile   Want to move fast  Be competitive  Move to the front of the pack  It s time to reconsider the way you plan your products   Keep reading
