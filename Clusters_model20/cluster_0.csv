5,training-dataset/product/297.txt,product,GV Guide to Design Critique   GV LibraryGV Guide to Design Critique  Critiques are one of the most important ingredients to great design  but far too often designers leave critiques secretly feeling scattered  frustrated  and disempowered  Even when everyone is well meaning  there are many subtle ways a critique can go off the rails and hurt your design process  Thankfully  with a bit of thoughtfulness and care  any company can craft a culture of productive  passionate  and candid feedback  Here s how   To deliver great design  teams need a culture of healthy feedback  I ve worked on dozens of tech teams  each with a different culture of feedback  The worst feedback sessions felt like a trip to a target range   designers gently release their lovingly crafted work to the group  only to have it blown out of the sky by a thousand different complaints   Why isn t the button red  Can we make that bigger   Other teams are overly polite and deferential  It s easier  but silence won t push designers from average solutions to great design   I used to think that these differences in feedback style were baked so deeply into a company s culture that they d be impossible to change  But then I noticed something surprising  across all these different teams the feedback that was happening within design teams was always helpful  When designers gave feedback to each other  they were focused the same goals  candid about where proposed solutions weren t working  and creative about alternate approaches   How did these designers create a microcosm of healthy feedback  It s actually simple  they were all taught how to critique in school  Yep  it s a totally learnable skill  And by following a few simple guidelines  and keeping each other honest to those guidelines  any team can build a healthy culture of design feedback   1  Use formal critiques to jumpstart change  Any behavior change can be tricky  And getting a whole team to change how they give feedback might seem downright impossible  But a little structure can go a long way  Start by moving all informal design feedback into specific scheduled critique sessions  This allows you to invite the right people  articulate the goals  and lay out ground rules for feedback   You should aim to have only a few people in the room so that there s a single conversation  5 6 people is about right  It s also helpful to have a diverse set of experiences  Rather than include folks with big titles  CEO  CTO  etc    think about who has the best data to inform the design  For example  including customer support or sales can help clarify customer goals  And including people familiar with the creative process can help when you re feeling stuck   Running the critique with a designated facilitator can help keep everything on track for the first few times  The facilitator s job is not to give feedback  but to make sure everyone is giving the right kind of feedback  This might seem heavyweight at first  but as your team internalizes critique habits  you ll need less structure  Soon every bit of feedback  even hallway conversations  will be more productive   2  Start with critique guidelines  The most important idea for everyone to understand is the purpose of a critique  We are here to give the designer feedback so they can make the product better  We are not here to blame anyone for places where the product is failing  or to design better solutions on the spot  Critiques help designers improve their designs   So start critiques by reiterating this purpose and reminding everyone how to give good feedback  Here s a few guidelines that I ve found helpful in critiques   Be candid   It doesn t help anyone to stay silent during a critique  only to express your doubts privately later  Encourage feedback from everyone  whatever their title or role in the company     It doesn t help anyone to stay silent during a critique  only to express your doubts privately later  Encourage feedback from everyone  whatever their title or role in the company  Be specific   Be as detailed as possible about what s working and what s not  If you say a whole design is not working  be prepared to back it up with a lot of specifics     Be as detailed as possible about what s working and what s not  If you say a whole design is not working  be prepared to back it up with a lot of specifics  Tie everything to goals   Critique not about whether you like or dislike a design  Good feedback is about how the design is meeting  or missing  the customer and business goals  Stay analytical  If you have an emotional reaction  this sucks   dig for why you re feeling that way     Critique not about whether you like or dislike a design  Good feedback is about how the design is meeting  or missing  the customer and business goals  Stay analytical  If you have an emotional reaction  this sucks   dig for why you re feeling that way  Affirm what s working   Always call out what s working well  Otherwise  you might lose a great idea in the next design iteration     Always call out what s working well  Otherwise  you might lose a great idea in the next design iteration  Problems first  then solutions   If you think of a new design idea  great  So did everyone else though  So instead of arguing over solutions  start by taking a step back and first discussing problems with the current design  Then share your solution  smarty pants     If you think of a new design idea  great  So did everyone else though  So instead of arguing over solutions  start by taking a step back and first discussing problems with the current design  Then share your solution  smarty pants  Suggestions  not mandates   Any new ideas should be given as suggestions  not mandates  That s because abstract ideas often seem better than concrete ones  Trust the designer to explore a new design direction and make their own call     Any new ideas should be given as suggestions  not mandates  That s because abstract ideas often seem better than concrete ones  Trust the designer to explore a new design direction and make their own call  Have fun    When humans are stressed  we re not very creative  But when we re playing  it s much easier to see the wide world of possibilities  So do anything you can to set the mood  play music as people are arriving  start with funny youtube video  throw around some NERF balls  have everyone stand  and pick a location that s comfortable   3  Set the stage  Even when everyone in a design critique knows how to give good feedback  things can still go off the rails  If a designer simply puts up a screen and says   What do you think    the meeting is bound for chaos  That s like jumping on a dogsled  saying  Mush    and then watching all the dogs take off at top speed in different directions because you forgot to put on the harness   So after going over critique guidelines  but before presenting work  the designer must set the stage  Everyone is coming to the meeting with their own assumptions about customer needs  their own pet business goals  and differing familiarity with the project  Setting the stage is about creating a common world view and preparing everyone to see the design not in relation to their own experiences  but as a solution to a specific problem   Here s an example of how I typically set the stage   Review business goals   This quarter our team s main goal is to improve conversions through the application process     This quarter our team s main goal is to improve conversions through the application process  Review customer goals   We ve heard many times in customers interviews that the application process is too complicated and hard to complete in one sitting     We ve heard many

in 2 months  So that means we should have a prototype nailed down for testing by next week     We want to launch a new version in 2 months  So that means we should have a prototype nailed down for testing by next week  Check for agreement   Does this sound right  Anything I m missing  We should hash it out now if I anyone disagrees     Does this sound right  Anything I m missing  We should hash it out now if I anyone disagrees  Set expectations on level of fidelity   I ve just spent a few hours sketching out an overall flow and some draft copy  So this is very rough     I ve just spent a few hours sketching out an overall flow and some draft copy  So this is very rough  Direct the feedback   I want to know if you think this overall approach is right  Don t worry about the layout of pages  I really need feedback on the flow and which features should be on which page   4  Simulate the customer experience  Critiques are not pitch meetings  There are plenty of tricks for showing how clever a designer you are  or for getting a group to consensus  But this is a critique  We re attempting to get inside the head of our customers  and see our product with fresh eyes  So for the first pass through the design  it s helpful to simulate the customer experience as closely as possible   Pick a task   Instead of a single mockup  show a flow  Don t assume your colleagues can imagine how the product might work  Pick a task and render every single screen  I know that s a lot of work  but it s worth it     Instead of a single mockup  show a flow  Don t assume your colleagues can imagine how the product might work  Pick a task and render every single screen  I know that s a lot of work  but it s worth it  Back it up   Start the flow a few steps earlier to get everyone into context  If you re critiquing a mobile sign up  start with an app store  If you re critiquing an email campaign  show a crowded inbox first     Start the flow a few steps earlier to get everyone into context  If you re critiquing a mobile sign up  start with an app store  If you re critiquing an email campaign  show a crowded inbox first  Use a screen   Paper is great  but your customers won t be able to glance back at an earlier screen if they get confused  So for the first runthrough  it s best to flip between screens     Paper is great  but your customers won t be able to glance back at an earlier screen if they get confused  So for the first runthrough  it s best to flip between screens  Fake it   Be scrappy about making the designs seem real  Throw your screens into Flinto or Keynote to make a rough prototype  Simple animations add a ton  And even if you don t have hot spots just pretend it s working by moving your mouse  Trust me  no one will know     Be scrappy about making the designs seem real  Throw your screens into Flinto or Keynote to make a rough prototype  Simple animations add a ton  And even if you don t have hot spots just pretend it s working by moving your mouse  Trust me  no one will know  Don t pitch hard   You won t be there to pitch your brilliant design rationale for every customer  Your design needs to stand on it s own  So start simply by explaining what the user is doing at each step   You can break into a grid system discussion later      You won t be there to pitch your brilliant design rationale for every customer  Your design needs to stand on it s own  So start simply by explaining what the user is doing at each step   You can break into a grid system discussion later   Write down feedback   Ask everyone to silently write down feedback as you go  That way you can get through the whole task in real time  You ll also be gathering a wider range of opinions and avoiding groupthink   5  Gather feedback and discuss  Now the easy part  Discuss  Go around the room and ask everyone for their feedback  Stay curious  And although we started by showing screens  it can be helpful now to move over to paper printouts so that people can see the whole flow  and so you can take notes directly on top of the designs  Don t be precious about your printouts either   get in there and draw   If the feedback gets a little harsh  it s easy to take it personally  So if you start feeling bad  remember  you are not your design  Even great designers get off track  Re focus your energy on listening and finding ways to improve the design in the next iteration   You ve got the feedback  now what   Feedback is a gift  I love it  Whenever I m too close to a problem  I rely on my coworkers to help me get perspective  But as a team  we can all be too close to the problem  So it s important to get outside the building and show your prototypes to customers as soon as possible   Critique is still the first way I get feedback on all my designs  And once I work with a team for a few weeks  this careful process of critique becomes easier  we can skip the guidelines  move faster through setting the stage  and even use the same structure for quick hallway discussions  All of those automatic habits slowly compile to be part of a team s design culture  And once that strong culture is built  designers will be more productive  effective  and happy   I know design critiques are a lot of work  They rob time away from other important tasks like writing code and replying to customer support tickets  But great design doesn t come from putting a designer in the corner and hoping they come up with the right solution  The best designs spring from collaborations between product  engineering  customer support  sales  and others  Simply put  Design is everyone s job  And if you re looking for how to contribute to great design  start by getting your team to participating in design critiques,"[5 1236 207 235 1251 523 701 8 862 879 189]"
8,training-dataset/product/160.txt,product,Thoughtbot s Kyle Fiedler  Know yourself and trust your processWe sat down with Kyle Fiedler  Chief Design Officer at thoughtbot  to chat about involving designers in business strategy  hiring the right people  and the one thing teams need to build great software   How is your team set up   The design team consists of about 25 designers across the US and Europe  We work alongside roughly 80 web and mobile developers  For each client  we divide into teams that best suit the needs of the client  the problem the client is attempting to solve  and the people who have the problem   Teams are usually comprised of 2 4 people per project  with about half being designers and half being developers  Some project teams consist of only designers or developers  but we try as much as possible to have both roles represented   What s the culture like there   Collaborative  friendly  and thoughtful  We trust everyone at thoughtbot to do the right thing for them and the company our primary policy for everyone is   Use your best judgment    We strive to be as transparent as possible  Our company handbook  which contains our benefits  hiring procedure  and other company policies  is hosted in Github  Any employee of thoughtbot can request a change in the way we do business  The vibe is a bit different in each studio based on the personalities of the people and the culture of the city   How does your team communicate with each other  And how do you communicate with people on different teams   We expect everyone on the team and our clients to communicate with respect and thoughtfulness  We expect our work environment to be collaborative  with everyone having an equal say in the business or app and no one taking orders   We use Slack to communicate in real time across all our studios  Even though most of our teams sit alongside each other  we ll still talk through Slack to avoid interruptions and because we have some remote teams   Each project gets its own Slack channel for conversation about that particular project  We have thoughtbot only channels for topics like design  design review  sales  cats  parenting  and more  These rooms make the studios feel more like one big community instead of several separated ones   We have Trello boards for everything from hiring to sales to research  This allows us to track the progress of hiring a candidate or the success of a sales lead in our funnel  In addition to a Slack channel  each client project also gets a Trello board for tracking progress that we re making on that particular project  We actively encourage our clients to participate in discussions that we have on cards and explain to them how we write new ones and prioritize them   We use an internal tool called Constable for team messages  Constable posts are broken into tags for interests similar to our Slack  so we spend less time managing emails  We usually announce new hires  new internal projects  updates from offices  and more via Constable   How do you hand off designs to the engineering team   We work so closely with our developers that there really isn t a handoff  They re involved with the project from the start by participating in research and in our design sprints  They each bring their own unique knowledge and perspective to the design process   We use Trello to handle feature tracking and any handoff we do have  We break down each story using the Jobs To Be Done story format  I ve found that the designers and developers have more empathy for their users with this format  Every story is design led and is open for any solution to the job  This allows for the team to hopefully work together to design and build the feature   Design could simply be a sketch for a developer to interpret  or it could be static HTML and CSS in a branch for a developer to take over  or something in between  How this gets handled depends largely on the team individuals as well as on the problem they re trying to solve   Tell me about your hiring process   We believe that a diverse team makes the best products  so we don t look for people who come from one specific background or path  We look for designers who can provide new perspectives and teach the team something new   We ask to see a portfolio as well as some HTML and CSS samples to get an initial sense of their skill level  When those come in from our hiring form  I usually look over them and see if their skills would make them successful at thoughtbot as designer  If I m on the fence  I ll usually ask for a second opinion from the designers at the studio they re applying to   The next step is a non technical interview  usually with me  We discuss their experience as a designer  the teams they ve worked on  what products they ve worked on  and what they re passionate about  I m usually looking to see if they d be a good fit for thoughtbot  Are they a leader on their current team  Are they someone who can self manage  Are they someone who has ideas about how to build software more effectively  I m also looking to see what passion and drive they can bring to the team  Where do their interests lie  Where do they excel  and where do they see places for improvement   The next step is the technical interview  where the candidate will speak with another designer about their process on a recent project  We re paying attention to how they approached the project and in retrospect  how they could have done a better job  I really like hearing about failure and how they and their team dealt with it  We also ask questions about HTML and Sass  We want to make sure that their code knowledge is current and that they won t be in over their heads building products on a client team   The final step is an office visit  Applicants pair with designers in the morning and typically tackle front end problems  This includes small bugs or features that show both their problem solving skills on a small scale  as well as their knowledge of HTML and CSS  In the afternoon we give the designer a challenge  We have a few briefs that we choose from and send the day before so that the candidate has some time to think about the design problem they might be solving  They have the opportunity to ask us questions right after lunch   We re seeking candidates to lead us in some design exercises much like we do in a design sprint  The challenge is supposed to mimic a briefer start of our process  At the end of the day  they present their work to designers and developers that are interested in attending  They re expected to discuss their design and thought process for what solution they arrived at  as well as what their process was for getting there   The designers watch the presentation and act like a client  asking questions about the solution  We re watching to see how open the candidate is with feedback  how much they ve thought through solving the user s problem  what the smallest solution is to test assumptions we re making  and where they might have conducted more research to validate those   Should designers learn to code   Here  our teams work best with designers who write HTML and CSS and aren t afraid to jump into a mobile codebase either  We ve found that it works best for the small teams that we have  This doesn t necessarily mean that it ll work for all teams  projects  or designers   I encourage any designer who s curious about code  whether that be HTML and CSS  Javascript  Swift  or Rails  to dive in and start building something   I do think at bare minimum designers need to know what is and isn t possible on the medium they re designing for  That might take the form of having some knowledge of HTML and CSS and programming  but it could also mean having a great front end developer  sitting next to them and constantly questioning them about the medium  That s not limited to the web it also applies to any other medium  like print  You might not be the one printing everything  but you need to know how something is going to be printed and the constraints of the medium   How did you get to where you are now   Growing up  I was really into drawing and painting  In high school I took a class on Photoshop and Illustrator using one of those colorful iMacs  We used to save everything we made directly to a ZIP drive  I got hooked on doing art and design on the computer   I went to Endicott College and studied visual communications  My roommate Mike Kivikoski and I both fell in love with designing for the screen  We played around with Flash and built interfaces with HTML and CSS  Most of the design courses were focused on print and branding they hadn t yet caught up to the web  so we taught ourselves and showed each other what we built and how   Out of college  I got a job as a web designer at a Fortune 500 company  but I wasn t happy there  I spent most of my day to day designing HTML deal emails using bright reds  yellows  and all caps  It wasn t glamorous   I applied to thoughtbot for a design position twice and got the job the second time  This was back when we only had our Boston studio  I was there for about 3 years before moving to Philly  where I was asked to open a studio there  Because of that  my role went from Designer to Managing Director of the Philly studio  I was the only designer in management at the time  and I felt the need to support the design team   I ve always wanted thoughtbot to be known more for our design than our development  I initiated one on ones with designers  trying to figure out how to make thoughtbot a great place for them to succeed  for us to push well thought out applications  and to ensure that the designers at the company felt supported in any endeavor they hoped to pursue  I pushed for more designers in management positions  That work led to my title of Chief Design Officer and gave me the opportunity to promote a designer in each of our studios to the position of Design Director   Does your team trust each other  How have you built that up   I think that s the only way to build great software  Our design teams regularly hold critiques in each studio  We post designs and pull requests for review and feedback in front of the whole company so that someone else looks over everything we do  It ensures that all of our work is the highest quality  and it also proves to be a great place for designers to teach each other and learn  They also open up creative exercises on Fridays to everyone at the company  We ve done lunchtime drawtime  crocheting  design challenges  and more   Only hiring people we know will be successful at thoughtbot is key  Knowing that each designer went through our rigorous process and has a similar skillset builds trust from the beginning   Are there any qualities in your design process that you consider unique   All of our designers see the project through from business strategy to implementation  There s less communication overhead and more of an opportunity for us to be seamless from role to role  This means that the designer has a lot of influence over the product that s being made  They can design and build features that they believe solve the problem based on research that they  themselves  conducted  The loop of getting feedback  designing a solution  and implementing said solution is really short because only one or 2 people complete it  I ve had days where I ve conducted interviews in the morning  saw issues in the app  and then pushed fixes for them in the afternoon   What do you think is the most powerful part of your design process   The start of the project  when we conduct research and run a design sprint  It s really easy to jump right into building the wrong features for clients  wasting our time and their money  Design sprints help you immediately put a lot of emphasis on building something that solves a problem  The research and design sprint are meant to give us confidence early in the project  We go into building products with some validation and are continuing to get that validation throughout the time the client is with us  We do so by talking to users and seeing how they operate the software we build   Related  Frequently asked questions about design sprints  What are some design trends you re interested in or currently trying out   I m mostly interested in figuring out how design thinking and research can influence our clients  projects so they leave thoughtbot with a successful application that solves a need  I m interested in different design research techniques and prototyping techniques to get early validation that our teams are heading in the right direction  Lately  I ve been digging into Jobs To Be Done to help me figure out where the problem really is and how people are currently solving for it   What do you think the design industry is going to be like in 5 years   In 5 years  designers will have a greater effect on business decisions  I think for a long time  engineers and traditional business folks were the ones at the head of a company  I also think design thinking and design leadership can help make a company successful  Starting a company with design at the forefront and looking at all processes as being designed will be important   In terms of technology  I think we ll start to have more variety of devices we re designing for  I picture technology such as watches that need simpler interfaces for complex interactions  or VR devices that might have much more rich and complex displays that we ll need to create deep and engaging experiences for   How do you use InVision as part of your design process   We use InVision for prototyping during our design sprints  Since we have just one day to design and build a prototype  having a tool that allows us to easily push out a clickable prototype to show in front of users is paramount  InVision makes it easy to turn sketches into prototypes we can show potential users   What s your best advice for young designers   Always start with a problem  and then create solutions with your team  Rely on your team s experience and knowledge  Everyone brings something different to the table   It s never too early to ask for feedback  The more eyes I get on a user flow  visual design  or HTML and CSS  the better it ll be   Never stop learning  and follow your passion  If you like implementing your designs  learn how to do so  If you love doing research  do more of it  If mobile is grabbing your attention  work on it   Figure out your process  Everyone s is different  and what separates designers is how well they know themselves and trust their process   Oh  and have fun  We get to live in a time where we make magic happen on screens all across the world  It s an amazing thing  Enjoy the process of making things that people use,"[8 862 523 879 1024 1251 189 942 1308 1173 1277]"
21,training-dataset/product/1181.txt,product,Human Centered Design   The 6 Fundamental Principles of Interaction Between Products and UsersHuman Centered Design   The 6 Fundamental Principles of Interaction Between Products and Users  Design is all around us  To some  design is present in the beauty of things  to others  in its ability to function flawlessly or solve a problem  But the fact is that definitions and opinions aside  everything that was made by man  was also designed  and so design is ubiquitous  But not all of us see it everywhere  This is because good design interacts and communicates with the user so effectively  that the experience is rarely internalized  We simply don t notice it anymore  so good design is the one that communicates its function and behavior in such a clear and subtle way  that it becomes invisible   When the user understands or discovers how an object or product is supposed to work  what it s supposed to do  and how it s supposed to behave  even when broken  just by looking at it  then a successful communication between object and user has taken place  This is referred to as discoverability by Don Norman   director of The Design Lab at UC San Diego   in his book The Design of Everyday Things  and it leads to a successful interaction between object and user   Discoverability is possible because of Human Centered Design  HCD   an approach that puts emphasis on the person s natural needs and behavior  rather than on the object itself  It s inspired by behaviors rather than demographics  it takes place in natural contexts as opposed to artificial ones  and it relies on dynamic conversations instead of scripted interviews  The philosophy and procedures of HCD add deep consideration and study of human needs to the design process   Human Centered Design  But are there any specific factors that facilitate discoverability  Norman states that discoverability results from the appropriate application of five fundamental psychological concepts  affordances  signifiers  constraints  mappings  feedback and a sixth one he calls the conceptual model   So  in the line of  The Universal Principles of Design  or  Dieter Rams  Principles of Design   here are The 6 Fundamental Principles of Interaction   Affordances  An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the user that determine the different uses that can be given to said object  The transparency of the glass affords to let light through  but it does not afford for physical particles to go through  so a wine glass affords not only to contain something  but also to easily see it  Affordances need to be visible in order to provide strong clues to the operations of things without the need for labels or instructions  These unwritten clues are called signifiers   Signifiers  Signifiers are indicators of any type that communicate the action needed so the affordance can take place  and it s a term that s widely used in the field of semiotics  For example  a door has the affordance of opening and closing  But how do we know how to do this  How do we know how if we have to push  pull or slide  For the most part  handles tell us  Those are the door s signifiers in relation to the affordance of closing and opening it  A large horizontal bar lets us know that we need to push it  while a handle lets us know we need to pull it  To function in the world  we need to develop internal models of what things mean and how they operate  and signifiers help us with that   No handle signifies push  while a handle signifies pull   Constraints  Constraints are limitations or restrictions  and they give us clues that allow us to determine a course of action by limiting the possible actions available to us According to Norman  there are 4 types of constraints   Physical   This pertains to the limitations caused by physical features such as size and shape     This pertains to the limitations caused by physical features such as size and shape  Cultural   Restrictions that are a consequence of what is socially and culturally deemed as acceptable behavior     Restrictions that are a consequence of what is socially and culturally deemed as acceptable behavior  Semantical   Limitations that rely upon the meaning of the situation to control the set of possible actions     Limitations that rely upon the meaning of the situation to control the set of possible actions  Logical   A type of constraint that comes to our attention because of its obviousness or because our logic was violated  The last piece of the puzzle must go in the only space left and if we have a bolt left after assembling a piece of furniture  then we must have made a mistake because the bolt must go somewhere   Physical Constraints  Square pegs only fit in square spaces   Mapping  Mapping is a mathematical term synonymous with function  which is a relationship between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs  For instance  to turn the volume of the tv up  turning the tv s volume up or down is an affordance of the remote   first we look for the volume button  a signifier that communicates the remote s affordance of volume control  and then we press up if we want the volume louder or down if we want it softer  This relationship between up   loud and down   soft is mapping  and it works best by naturally taking advantage of spatial analogies  like in the case of the remote   The mapping of lights and the physical elements of the buildings facade   Feedback  Feedback happens when an object or system notifies the user that it is working towards the completion of its objective  A clear example of this is elevators  When we press the button to call an elevator  it tells us that it s on its way by lighting up  However  it s not the most effective feedback because it doesn t let us know how long we will have to wait  and this uncertainty causes users some discomfort  Good design gives back clear feedback in order to avoid any type of discomfort or difficulty   Conceptual Models  Conceptual model is a synonym for a psychological term called association  which refers to a connection between conceptual entities or mental states that result from the similarity between those states or their proximity in space or time  In the words of Don Norman   a conceptual model is an explanation  usually highly simplified  of how something works  It doesn t have to be complete or even accurate as long as it is useful   He illustrates his point with an excellent example of the folder shaped icons found in our computers  Computers don t have folders  however  designing the icons as folders makes it easier for us to conceptually understand how computers store information by allowing us to make an association with something that is familiar to us  This association is what allows effective communication between user and object  bringing the design one step closer to success   Like this

got stakeholder approval  so you hand off the design to your developer and pat yourself on the back   But then you get a preview  And  it looks nothing like the design you had in mind   What in the world happened   Well  most developers aren t designers  Some might have a good eye for design  but the majority will need clear communication and direction from the designer in order to deliver something pixel perfect   On the flipside  because most designers aren t developers  sometimes a design winds up being impossible for a developer to build because of technology restrictions  There s no way for a designer to know that unless they involve their developer from the start   Related  6 tasty ways for designers and developers to collaborate better  I ve spent a ton of time working with developers and figuring out how to optimize a great working relationship  It s really up to both to make it happen   Want to make working with your developer awesome  Follow these tips   Get familiar

the basics of how the server side of things work so you can create spatial elements that blend well with the information you have to work with  Your design will also be optimized to address all specific server side restrictions   A quick conversation with your developer right at the start of a project can help clarify the entire process  Another thing that helps make everything crystal clear  create a wireframe  share it with your dev  then meet to discuss it  A quick feedback session could result in an even better design or it could keep you from wasting time on something that isn t possible to build   Get to know client side limitations and abilities  The server side and the client side of programming are completely different worlds  This disparity can certainly influence the visualization of a design  For instance  if you need to make a specific element work on Explorer 9  This can create a conflict based on what software you each use and your individual workflow   That s why it s useful that if the developer uses Iconic  you as a designer need to make sure that the elements of your design can also work on Iconic  You really don t want to have to use images for every element in this case   A good design not only looks good and is easy to use  it s also fast loading and efficient  To make a web design load fast  you need to create a design that uses as much style in the code as possible  For example  I ll always use CSS buttons for websites  They load fast and they look good on every platform   Speaking of platforms  this is another issue that needs to be addressed  Your design should fit all resolutions and platforms  Consequently  it can pay off if you understand and learn each platform s unique restrictions  resolutions  and code support   However  platforms can vary from screen to screen  Each unique platform is built to handle your design in a different way  Therefore  each unique platform will handle your design s functionality differently   Related  Why you shouldn t ignore the bigger breakpoints in responsive web design  A case in point  if you make your information appear when the mouse hovers over an element and the platform has a touchscreen  well  there is no mouse over you ll need to alter the design to fit touchscreen devices   More mobile limitations to keep in mind   Needing a keyboard to pop up for a form  Adjusting click size depending on the user s finger size  Addressing connection problems  Your design should look good even if it loads in sections  Keeping mobile designs and interaction simple and not too complex  This is mainly because a device s graphic card is sometimes limited on mobile compared to desktop  Providing the option for right clicks  Make sure users have a way to open the right click menu  if you have one  when needed  Releasing information faster  Mobile users are usually doing something else while using their device   These distractions need to be addressed by presenting the information and actions in a clear  simple  and fast manner   Create a demo mockup and behavior documentation  After you ve finished the design  you ll want to create a working demo  I use InVision for this portion of the process  I think it s a great tool to showcase my designs because it helps me show the developer exactly what I want to focus on in each section of a design  This includes how each feature will behave  where each link routes to  and much more  It takes only a few minutes to create a working demo  but it can save a lot of time not having to go back and forth with the developer   Plus  InVision lets you write comments right on the designs so you can add explanations   Organize files and folders  Before you send a large load of files to your developer  be sure to establish some order  You definitely don t want to send your developer a mess of files that they ll have to sort through and organize  Nobody has time for this   Since you re most familiar with your files  be nice to your developer and send them a collection of nicely arranged files   For example  if there are a lot of files  I ll ensure that they re all labeled with the correct name of the page  platform  and size   ClientName_PageName_WidthXHeight_platform psd  MyClient_AboutUs_1334x750_IOS psd  I ll keep only the latest version of a file in its main folder  and I always arrange folders by platforms  I do this despite the fact that it s difficult to create one main folder with all the mobile and desktop files in one place  This way you won t make your developer have to work any harder to find the right files   Trust me  nobody wants to work on the wrong version of a design   These 4 simple tips can make life much easier for you and the developer you work with  You ll be able to develop an optimized workflow while you maintain a positive working environment   Remember  the better the relationship is between a designer and a developer  the more likely it is that you ll create amazing products   You might be surprised by how much useful design input a developer may be willing to share given the right circumstances   That s why it always pays to be kind to your developer,"[35 1277 796 8 189 149 245 485 1260 172 261]"
40,training-dataset/product/1073.txt,product,Where has the creativity gone in web  and UX  design Take a moment to think about the sites you ve visited today  Have any of them stood out to you as being unique in their design  If I had to put money on it  I d guess not   This is probably what you saw if you visited an agency website   It seems as though the entire web UX design industry has completely given up on actually designing new experiences  And this extends beyond the agency website paradigm   Ecommerce  social media  product pages  marketing landing pages  blogs  business directory websites  portfolios  personal sites  message boards  and even video sharing platforms are all conforming to the standard layouts prevalent in each industry   This may be startling news to many budding young designers out there  but it d seem that the fate of innovation in web design is in your hands   What will you do with all of that power   All is not lost  With the design industry coming to a massive  industry wide slowdown  what use is there in pursuing design  Why not develop universal wireframes for each industry  and simply stick to customizing the color schemes without any regard for UX innovation   Related  How to move from imitation to innovation  After all  there s a reason that sites are beginning to look more and more like each other  It s because the layout that I jokingly referred to above as being  every agency site on planet earth  is actually a usable design that requires little cognitive effort to figure out   So what s the problem   The problem is that sites like this systematically give every other designer  UX or otherwise  a bad name   Professional skateboarder Rob Dyrdek owns several pages  each of which is stunning and very innovative  They look nothing like the current standards for web design  and if a UX designer saw a wireframe for Dyrdekmachine com  they might even faint   It looks like someone with no design experience drew it on a napkin and then gave it to a coder with a good sense of taste  So why is it such a good design  Because it doesn t just break the mold for how a website should look and function  it shatters it   Innovation within the ecommerce paradigm  There isn t a single industry out there that is more guilty of stagnating design than the ecommerce paradigm   How many ecommerce sites do you visit that look like this   This may be in part because of industry giants like Amazon and Newegg  who utilize the most boring  basic  overused schema ever created for the web   And I don t blame them  Is your site making as much money as Amazon  I didn t think so   But Amazon and Newegg are just 2 sites  We can t blame the faults of the entire ecommerce industry on these 2 companies   Or can we   Often  designers with a limited budget may not have the time or money to conduct thorough research  Because of this  cues are often taken from sites with sizable research spends  that have presumably undergone countless iterations and optimizations   Surely Amazon and Newegg fit with these presumptions  But is that enough of a reason to follow in their footsteps   UX designers would argue that the reason for the prevalence of these types of layouts is that they re proven to be more or less frictionless during the conversion process   Related  3 ways friction can improve your UX  That said  it s not the only way to do things  Unless the client tasked you with creating a  site like Amazon   this shouldn t be your first instinct  Otherwise  we d all just recycle the same wireframes with only slight variations where appropriate  color  logo  font  etc   DC Shoes has  in particular  seemingly identified this trend and rectified it   When you visit their Evan Smith lineup page  you re greeted with a stream of product images arranged in a way that looks nothing like the traditional grid layout   If you click on an image  the page gives you an enticing  full screen preview of the product  along with conveniently placed purchase options along the right hand side of the window   Sadly  DC only made this design available for the top half of the page  Once you scroll far enough down  you re confronted with a rigid product grid no different from that of Amazon or Newegg   This isn t an inherently poor design choice  and it makes sense to cover all your bases when rolling out a new design  especially where sales are concerned   but it s still kind of disappointing   Design something new  please  This hasn t been one giant rant  This article is intended to spur some excitement and innovation in the web  and UX  design industry  There are ways to break the mold  without sacrificing conversions  Sometimes all it takes is working with the right design partner   Whether this means wowing the user with your superb animations  I m looking at you  Rob Dyrdek   or finding a new way to get your user to engage with your content  it is doable   Do not blindly follow industry standards  Do your own research  Play around with your own innovations and your own ideas   Sometimes an idea that seems silly is all it takes to make a wave in the industry,"[40 261 149 758

78,training-dataset/product/1072.txt,product,What exactly is a design culture  Design culture  is a loaded term often used  rarely understood  It seems like every company claims to embrace it  but few even understand what it is   Admittedly  it s a difficult phrase to define  Ask 5 different designers to explain design culture  you ll get 5 different answers  Is it about aesthetics  Process  Philosophy  All of the above   Perhaps it means something different for different organizations  While the particulars may change  though  design culture boils down to several overarching  universal themes   Understanding and respect  In an organization with a healthy design culture  everyone in the company is taught to understand and respect the value of design   Elsewhere  design is often misunderstood or maligned as being about  making things look pretty   When design isn t properly understood or respected  it often plays second fiddle to engineering and business decisions  resulting in poorer outcomes  In a true design culture  the whole team including and especially non designers understands that design is a holistic and process driven discipline that should be integrated throughout the organization   Intentionality  Design culture hinges on an understanding that decisions should be made intentionally  Even the smallest details can add up to produce a massive impact  so a design centric organization is biased against leaving anything up to chance   In a healthy design culture  design is applied not only to the product or service an organization produces  but also to the organization itself  Seemingly small details the lighting  the communication tools  the placement of the coffee machines are thoughtfully considered  To paraphrase Conway s Law  products tend to reflect the structure and character of the organizations that produce them  So  a well designed organization will result in well designed products and services   In a recent interview  Chloe Park of OpenTable described some of the cultural changes that occurred after the company was acquired by the very corporate Priceline    But I think that design has increased the level of intentionality behind the company s culture  I was just talking to another designer about this  and she was commenting about the little things that have changed throughout the office things that seem so fundamental or basic  but make a difference  We get flower deliveries  for example  and our receptionist separates them into multiple arrangements throughout the office  especially in the larger open spaces where people congregate and talk  We also have this thing where people don t have individual trash cans  we only have group trash cans in open areas  and I ve heard that was to get people to come out and talk to each other   Little things like that  or the placement of coffee  add an increased quality of presence to things  When you re talking to a very design centric company or a smaller startup where everyone has control over these things it s kind of like  duh   but when you re scaling this large and no one is being intentional or careful about the little things  it can get quite messy  And so I feel like design has introduced a certain level of care    Universality holistic  Design isn t just for designers  In a healthy design culture  everyone in the organization should feel empowered to participate in the design process  And everyone should be encouraged to apply design thinking to problems that aren t obviously design related   Freedom to fail  Design cultures have a high tolerance for failure  Employees are encouraged to experiment and iterate  with the understanding that this will occasionally lead to mistakes  They should feel free to take risks when appropriate and learn from their mistakes  without fear of being reprimanded or fired   A true design culture recognizes that what happens after an error is more important than the error itself  and values course correction more than constantly playing it safe   Proactivity  Design has the greatest impact when it s proactive  not reactive  It s about making specific decisions rather than constantly responding to incoming issues and tasks  In a healthy design culture  the designers spend more time on constructive tasks creating something new or iterating on something that already exists than fixing problems and digging the organization out of a hole   Humanity empathy  Design culture is about rediscovering the human side of business  For much of the 20th century  businesses were driven solely by data and efficiency decisions  often to the detriment of their employees and customers  Things were only valued if they were measurable if something couldn t be represented by a point on a graph  it didn t matter   In many ways  design culture is a reaction against this data driven mentality  Of course data is a valuable part of everything in fact  design should rely on quantitative research as often as possible  But design rejects the idea that efficiency is the sole purpose of an organization  It recognizes that the unmeasurable can be just as important as the measurable  and that emotions are as valid as intellect   Perhaps there are no measurable gains from developing brand guidelines  or ensuring that an organization s materials all adhere to the same design language  But reducing frustration and making an organization s culture and output a little more pleasant a little more human displays a level of care and craft that s worth pursuing on its own merits   Design is a gestalt discipline  While individual changes may not be measurable  when taken cumulatively they often lead to big gains that can influence an organization s bottom line  Design culture isn t a boondoggle it s a launchpad for future successes   Design is becoming an increasingly valued part of all kinds of organizations  from tiny startups to legacy enterprises  We find ourselves in a transitional period  with all the growing pains that go along with it  Plenty of executives in the C suite know  design culture  is something they need  but they don t know what that means and do nothing more than pay it lip service   As designers  we can choose to only work at places that have a strong design culture  but we also have an opportunity to bring those values into new territory  Our way of thinking is becoming increasingly recognized as a huge driver of value  did you hear that design driven companies outperform the S P by 228  over 10 years   and companies are finding that impossible to ignore   We have a chance to spread the values of design throughout the corporate world  making our organizations both more human and more successful   That s a priceless opportunity,"[78 523 261 1251 1024 879

149,training-dataset/product/1158.txt,product,7 essential design principles for product managersAbout 50  of all design firms sold in the last ten years were acquired in the last 24 months  And they weren t bought by Amazon or Facebook or Google  They were bought by the banks and consulting firms the BIG financial institutions  These organizations don t have the most innovative reputations  after all  they re referred to as  laggards    so when even these companies are adopting design firms it says something drastic  It says  design should be a product priority   Design is a specialized skill  and as a PM  it can be intimidating especially if it s not your natural inclination   Having spent most of my career as a product manager  I ve stated clearly and to a lot of pushback that design should always be a priority for product managers  Design is a specialized skill  and as a PM  it can be intimidating especially if it s not your natural inclination   Plus  there s usually a design team to deal with that stuff  right   But that mentality is a missed opportunity  it s equally important for PMs to keep design top of mind when making decisions   Product design was one of our key differentiators when we founded Roadmunk  As I ve previously written about  we didn t necessarily have the data to back up that decision at the time  But look at these new statistics and tell me design isn t rising in importance   The laggards are waking up and savvy PMs are talking about how crucial design has become to the product development process  Now it s time to integrate some concrete methods for bringing design more deeply into the PM process   There are seven product design principles that I believe all product managers should follow  Blending my first hand experience and observations  these are the essential design principles that I think every product manager must internalize and evangelize especially if design is not your fort    1  Tell users what to think  This first principle is an evolutionary design concept from engineer Steve Krug  It states that when designing  we should listen to our users  needs to the point that we know and tell them what they should be thinking  Basically  you should understand your users  workflow so much so that you can determine what they re attempting to do   Like an  actually  perceptive fortune teller    This example might help you visualize what I mean  Below  you ll see flight search engine Kayak  It s really well designed  simple and easy to use  The problem  though  I m not sure where exactly to focus   While the UI is fantastic  the important things stand out  like the calls to actions and filters   I can t confidently say the same for the user experience which is just as critical as the UI  I see way too much competition between the various colors  equal priority given to all the filters  multiple lines of information in each section  It s a lot   Enter Google Flights  On an aesthetic level it doesn t compare to the best websites you ve ever seen let alone Kayak but they ve done a really important thing  they ve established the priority in which they want you to think about things   You like nonstop flights  Bam  There they are at the top of the list   Price is a big influencer for you  Awesome here are the lower prices first   Airlines and WiFi are deal breakers  Okay then  here s that information upfront   They ve taken into account what they already know about their users and told them   This is what we know you want    Google Flights is showing what matters  They ve reduced the clutter by honing in on the key user needs and hiding putting aside the other features  The filters are all still there  they re just greyed out or lightened to improve the user experience  This to me is a great example of a company knowing their users and empathizing with them thoughtfully   2  Minimize cognitive load  A basic but easily overlooked concept is that a user experience should be simple  your design should make the user think as little as possible   That s got too much cognitive load  is probably a phrase you ve heard from almost every product designer ever  Okay  that might be an exaggeration  but the term cognitive load has become a keeper in the PM and design space  It s a fancy way to say  cut the clutter    Let s take the below example of an early version of the password program LastPass  I use this program all the time for its super practical functionality  but looking at this early design  I m overwhelmed for many reasons  For example   There is no focal point  Where the hell do I even start   Almost every button has the same degree of importance  Since when do edit  share and delete have the same weight as a user manual     The icon colours don t match at all  Like at all   Compare this version to the site s latest design and you ll notice a huge improvement  They ve designed for the user s core action of searching for a program specific password to change  edit or delete  So that means   Brand logos were expanded and put front and center  A hover effect was added to each brand for the secondary options  edit  delete  etc    While the design may look significantly different  it was fueled by simple tweaks that drastically reduced the thinking on the user s part and provided a cleaner emotional experience   3  Three click mentality  Simple exercise for you  Pick a website or app you love and see how many clicks it takes to get to a core action  Users don t want to click on endless buttons to reach their destination  they want short and sweet  One core design principle PMs should internalize is that every single core action should be achievable within 3 clicks  Granted  not every application can do this  but this is a great opportunity to challenge yourself   Let s take Amazon  It s a huge site  Imagine I bought something  I really love it  and now I want to tell the seller how I feel  How many clicks would it take to complete that task   Let s see   Step 1   Your Account  would be the natural first step to view past purchases  I hover over it which we ll consider half a click   Step 2  Click on  Your Orders    Step 3  Scroll down the list and click on  Write a product review    Done  In 2 5 clicks I ve reached my destination and can perform my core action  Despite being one of the biggest websites in the world  Amazon has taken into serious consideration how to streamline my user process   Again  I understand this isn t always possible  but I think the 3 click mentality can serve as a litmus test to see how friendly your application really is   4  Reversible design  We all make mistakes which is why product people designed the Undo button  Users can get pissed when they can t undo an action  I ve been there    Yet so many of the products in market still don t offer reversible options for certain actions   Reversible design is more than simply clicking an undo button  Here are some examples of reversible designs from the tools I use every day   The little  x  that lets me delete a filter on Intercom  Deleting or removing files from Google Drive  Moving a Trello card then being able to drag it back to its original place  If your support center is frequently inundated by questions from users who have lost files or accidentally changed work they didn t actually want to change  you re probably going to want to give them a way to backtrack  Where would we be without Command Z   5  Use verbs with context  If your dialogue boxes are bogged down with words like Yes  No  Cancel and Save  your users might be a little muddled  This vague terminology only increases cognitive load  Half the time you re not sure you re taking the right action  prolonging a process that should have taken little thought and even less time   Skilled designers have now narrowed down the options and provided context  Instead of a bevy of vague button choices  you get specific instructions  verbs phrases like Cancel or Yes  delete this message  Simple  And on top of that  you get context telling you why these verbs are here  e g  deleting the highlighted message   Already you ve reduced ambiguity and cognitive load   Sometimes it really comes down to something as easy as changing the text on the screen to significantly improve a user s experience   6  White space is your friend  a k a  Use white space to disrupt your competitors   This dead simple design principle can elevate your design from clunky to slick  When done well  it really eases the emotional experience for users  Designers tout this principle a lot  but there is still often a struggle to integrate the concept of white space     Take a look at WordPress  Yes  everything you see on this screen is something you ll need to use at some point in the blogging process  But when you re actually writing  i e  performing the software s core activity   this UI is very disruptive  It comes off as heavy and messy  Only 25  of the real estate is allocated to the white space for writing   The site has caught on to this criticism by providing a  Distraction free writing mode   the small button at the far right of the text editing toolbar  in their latest versions  Temporarily removing all the sidebars  this mode puts the writing space white space as the central focus of the page   Compare this to Medium  which has always been pretty much just white space  It provides a space to write your post  then add social widgets  type some tags and publish  Essentially they ve made the process much easier for someone who might be jarred by WordPress or similar publishing platforms  And it hasn t reduced functionality   7  Design in MSP  Minimum Saleable Product   So far  I ve mentioned common design principles you ll hear as a PM  but a less talked about principle is having your team design in MSP  minimum saleable product    I stay away from language like MVP  minimum viable product  unless it s an infrastructure related product because to me that ignores user experience  It puts it as this far off goal a  nice to have  rather than a  must have      Take the image below  The pyramid on the left shows that designing in MVP starts from the bottom  i e  the pink  and works its way up the pyramid addressing emotional design as the last  need  of the product  Whereas on the right  you see that designing in MSP tackles all the  needs  in the pyramid including emotional design simultaneously from the start  i e  why the pink component covers the entire height of the pyramid    MVPs encourage teams to get something out there that is functional  It can break  but as long as the functionality and workflow are available  it s solid  That  to me  is a  no   What about the usability  Or emotional connection   Think about any product you ve ever encountered  When you first enter an application or product  you have an emotional reaction based on the design alone  which either does or does not spur you to click around and see if it s usable  A product s design is the first thing a user acknowledges before anything else  it s the first impression   A product s design is the first thing a user acknowledges before anything else  it s the first impression   Yes  the product needs to be functional  but my sales team also needs to be able to sell to users  And not just to the early adopters and innovators  we need to sell this to the early majority  If these terms are unfamiliar  check out the Technology Adoption Lifecycle Model below  The model includes five stages of how a product gets adopted and the different customer segments within each stage   More detail on those segments here    In his hugely popular 1991 book Crossing the Chasm  author Geoffrey Moore explained that for products to be successful  they must cross a chasm that exists between early adopters and the majority of the market   Crossing the chasm is difficult  since the early majority is vastly different  i e  pickier  than the first two groups  who are more willing to put up with bugs and reliability issues  The way we cross the chasm is through designing an MSP  How  Because pickier audiences in the early majority will overlook faults that may exist when you offer a product with superior design elements    the more you focus on packaging saleable features with compelling  user friendly design  the more disruptive you can be to the market   Take my team at Roadmunk  which focuses on UX and users  emotional responses  We find that our users aren t gathering their pitchforks and starting a manhunt when there s an issue  because we ve designed in MSP to ensure that our app is kinda really pretty   shamelessselfpromotion   Don t get me wrong  functionality is still key  but the more you focus on packaging saleable features with compelling  user friendly design  the more disruptive you can be to the market   Final words  Let design be your secret weapon  Design has become more and more of a priority at product organizations  and it can be your secret weapon for standing out in a sea of competitors and changing the market  It doesn t matter whether you re working with your first prototype or the thousandth iteration of your product  your product s design should always be on your mind   Don t just leave design in the hands of your design team  PMs should be living and breathing it  too  Take the time to put design at the forefront of your product strategy and see how your users become emotionally invested,"[149 523 879 261 574 368 1109 1024 796 1251 35]"

172,training-dataset/product/347.txt,product,3 ways to improve collaboration between designers and developersOver the last few years  the importance of design in the tech industry has grown tremendously with a greater appreciation for designers who know how to work within development constraints   At Tendigi  we produce our best work when our designers and engineers work in a harmonious  cross collaborative environment  We d like to share 3 of the most powerful ways to make that happen at any organization   Be more pragmatic with decision making  You need a solid understanding of what is feasible to build within the scope of your product  The best starting point is to digest your platform s guidelines and standards  here you go  iOS  macOS  watchOS  material design  and web design    Be able to see how each component will be built from an engineer s perspective  Start to learn a programming language  Don t feel overwhelmed by the idea that you need to know how to build a product from scratch  but any amount of knowledge that comes from knowing how to code will help you make more informed design decisions and will also help you better communicate with engineers   Design for the best user experience first  then add the whimsy and fun  Remember  Basic UX principles should guide your design from the beginning  There has to be a balance between the amount of effort required to build a feature and the benefit of the result   Make the engineer s job as easy as possible  Provide your engineers with clean  well organized design files that have comps and layers plainly named  Cut assets yourself and name them appropriately for the given platform  I know this isn t the most fun job  But it ensures that what goes into the finished product is exactly what you want  It also takes the work away from your engineers  which means they can dedicate more time to building better features   Make sure your designs are consistent  Run audits over your work at different points in the design process  It s better to check yourself a million times than to block an engineer from developing down the road because there are differences in the treatment of similar elements   Make annotated documents when necessary  You can create your own  or utilize one of many tools such as Notebook for Sketch  Living and static style guides can aid in the cohesion of development for your product  Keep in mind that some developers never look at the style guide and work straight off a comp  so make sure to communicate early in the process with your engineering team  Spend your time wisely and efficiently   Prototypes and interaction animations show engineers how something should work in the most straightforward way possible  If you rely on word of mouth to get your point across  you leave a lot of room for misinterpretation and increase chances of the final product misaligning with your vision   Communicate constantly and respect the engineer s opinions  Don t silo yourself  or the engineer  off by only talking when it s time to hand off designs  When you work together from the beginning  you re more powerful and you ll ultimately create a better product   If you re unsure about a feature s design  how a transition will work  or the flow of a user s interactions  consult with your engineering team  They have a wealth of knowledge and can approach your problem from an analytical  technical perspective  Don t be shy to admit you need advice   These 3 lessons boil down to empathy  organization  and communication  The key with all of these  Make sure you re in control of the execution of the final product  You want your vision to be realized  right  So do everything you can to equip your engineers with the right materials and knowledge so they can execute your vision perfectly and so you end up with a kickass product   This post was originally published on Tendigi s blog,"[172 261 1024 1277 796 1173 523 8 1308 879 35]"

experience level   How does your team communicate   There are 17 of us on the design team  including 2 creative directors and a mix of senior  associate  and junior designers   We communicate and collaborate a ton in person with the exception of 3 employees  our entire staff is in house  We also use Slack internally and with clients  though we try to communicate the important stuff over email   In terms of client communication frequency  we meet with our clients consistently throughout the week  We always try to use video chat  Zoom  GoToMeeting  Google Hangouts  with our clients anything to make the relationship a little more human   How do you hand off designs to developers   It depends on who s doing the development  If we re doing the development  our development team should already be very familiar with what they re building since they re included in all the client meetings  We deliver the Sketch or Photoshop files to the devs  and we also use InVision prototypes for all projects   As they start building  there s a lot of back and forth that happens in person to make sure that the intentions of the design are maintained  while giving the developers the freedom to make tweaks and suggestions   Related  Get our free e course  Designing with your developer in mind  If we aren t doing the development  there s usually a handoff meeting or multiple meetings where our teams connect and we deliver files and an InVision prototype  We also use style guides with all of our projects to help external dev teams maintain consistency  especially if they have to design build screens on their own  Craft has been extremely useful in recent projects for doing most of the legwork in creating style guides from our Sketch files   We re extremely lucky in that we don t normally have to spend time building out detailed spec docs  Instead  we rely on collaboration and communication throughout the entire project   How do you think you create a great company culture   Culture is one of the most important aspects of a business  and we put a lot of time and effort into making sure ours stays awesome  Creating a great culture doesn t happen overnight you have to cultivate it over time   Some things we do to maintain our culture   Company lunches twice a week  Weekly design team critiques and workshops  Transparency with everything from revenue to hiring  A non waterfall approach to all the work we do  Tell us about your design process and what makes it effective   A good design process starts with a solid foundation of empathy  and that s exactly what we do  Do you understand what the business is trying to achieve  Do you understand what the user s or customer s needs are  Do you know how the specific industry functions  As a designer  you re designing solutions that fulfill business and customer needs  so you need to be able to look through both lenses   You also need a great team that you can work with collaboratively  I love when a good idea becomes a great idea through collaboration with others  At Digital Telepathy everyone has a voice in the design process  and it s not uncommon for strategists and developers to come up with design solutions that the design team didn t consider   How do you hire new people   Hiring is hard  As a 9 year veteran at our company  I ve been a part of every design hire we ve had  The first thing I do is look at the applicant s portfolio  Dribbble  Behance  etc  Usually within a couple of minutes I can spot if there s potential  The first place I look is typography  By looking at the type choice  sizing  line height  etc   I can pretty accurately measure a designer s experience   Based on the position we re hiring  I have to look at applicants through that lens  There might be someone without much experience who I can instantly tell has good style and aesthetic  With people who have lots of experience  it s often hard to tell what their role was on particular projects  Having them talk through a couple projects is a good way to gauge their experience   On your philosophy page  you say that everyone is a designer  What are some unexpected places you ve noticed amazing design lately   Here in San Diego  there are lots of new breweries and restaurants popping up everywhere  The attention to detail these companies put into their products and service is impressive  It s not enough anymore to have a great product your brand  service  and experience have to be carefully crafted as well   How did you personally get to where you are now   Lots of practice  Designing different websites and applications for a bunch of different industries and clients makes you a well rounded and experienced designer  It s cliche but you also have to be passionate about design  You should want to always do great work and constantly be learning   How do you use InVision   InVision houses all of our projects and designs  Before every presentation  we use InVision to turn JPGs into into clickable prototypes  During client presentations we use LiveShare to walk them through the designs  Then  after the meeting  we share InVision links with the clients so they can review the work and add comments   If we aren t able to present a design to a client  we ll often use Tour Points to walk them through important points throughout the design   The design team has also been using Craft a lot lately for component libraries and style guides   What s your best advice for young designers   Don t have an ego  Listen to others and embrace feedback  even if you don t agree with it   Get inspired  Jumping into a design without momentum and excitement is dangerous  If you have 4 hours to do something  spend the first 2 3 hours planning and getting inspired   Collaborate with your team and clients often  Being the designer doesn t mean you always have to be the expert   Explore  Even if you think you know the right solution  quickly explore lots of other directions  It ll validate the best solutions and give you ammo when someone asks  Did you try this    Don t be afraid of research  Talk to customers  create personas  map experiences  understand new industries  This knowledge will make your job 100  easier when it s time to start designing   Take initiative  Throw a workshop  write copy  do research  Don t wait for others to do things that are  out of your wheelhouse   They ll appreciate the legwork and you ll probably do it better than they would have   Pay attention to every detail  A single bad image  icon  typeface  or color can sour an entire design   Make connections  Be nice and get to know people  grow your network  and don t burn bridges   Never stop learning  Our industry changes overnight  Stay up to date with the latest and greatest  but don t be a know it all  Read  good  business books  learn how to code  take photos  draw  play music  be mindful  and stay active,"[189 8 862 1173 523 879 1290 5 1251 1308 979]"
207,training-dataset/product/377.txt,product,Running productive design critiquesThere is no  right answer  in design  To stay on the right track you need to really understand the problem you re trying to fix and constantly get feedback from the people you re designing for  But even if you re talking to them it s easy to get stuck designing on your own  Design critiques with your colleagues are one of the best ways of helping you get a new perspective on your design  You can sanity check your ideas and uncover things you never would have thought of  But it s easy for people to get distracted by unimportant details  have a different idea of what the problem is or just simply misunderstand how the solution you re proposing would actually work  We re doing design critiques all the time  so I ll walk you through how we do them at Intercom  and share a Sketch template we use every day  1  Define your goal Before showing any designs make sure everyone clearly understands the problem  You ll want to get 1 5 people with different perspectives on the problem  designers  engineers  support reps etc   It s critical to start by defining the goal of the critique and guiding others towards it  What do you need to make progress and keep moving forward  What kind of feedback are you looking for  It s up to the designer leading the critique to define the goals  the problem they re solving  potential solutions  and walk others through them  At this point  it s helpful to print posters that describe the problem and the proposed solutions and stick them on the wall  This makes it easy for everyone to keep the whole thing in their head and talk about specific options  No more  Can you scroll back to that design  No  the other one   If we re discussing interaction design we ll also have prototypes to test   2  Set the scene Before showing any designs you ll want to make sure everyone clearly understands the problem you re trying to solve and the context surrounding it  Otherwise how do you judge the designs  So give your problem a simple name and describe it in one paragraph of plain English  For example  Inviting colleagues  Only 5  of new sign ups invite their colleagues in the first 7 days  We ve seen that users who invite their colleagues tend to be more active and stick around longer  Visualize the problem by either drawing a diagram or showing screenshots if you can   We use Job Stories to understand user motivations  so we include those as well   3  Bring the team through your proposal When everyone is on the same page and understands the problem you re trying to solve  it s time to show how you re proposing to fix it  Ideally you should have a number of radically different options to show  This helps people understand why some options are better than others  Again  give a name for each of your proposals so everyone can refer to them and describe them in one paragraph of plain English  It s really important these ideas are easily comparable  so instead of mixing multiple ideas together break them apart into separate ideas  Otherwise you might dismiss a good solution just because it was coupled with a bad one  It s often useful to draw a diagram of how your proposed solution works before diving into UI detail  Particularly with interconnected products like Intercom  starting with a high level map of how your design behaves as a system is essential   Then show your proposed interface design either as prints or a walk others through a prototype  Lastly  say what you think is good and bad about each of the options  and be brutally honest  If there s any open questions about your proposals that still need to be figured out  mention those as well  4  Have some productive discussions When everyone understands the problem and how you re proposing to fix it  that s when you can have a productive discussion  A great way to start it is by saying which of the options you think works best and why  It won t be long before others respond with disagreements  ways to further improve your solutions  or argue for other options that weren t even presented  Remember  keep the meeting goals in mind  Sometimes you ll get feedback that you re not actively looking for  For example  you might be looking for feedback on a specific interaction  but getting questions about why you re doing this in the first place  These are great sanity checks  Without a great answer to this question  you really should be asking yourself whether this is a good problem to solve  However  if you re still trying to figure out how the system should work but getting feedback on the interaction details  let the group know it s too early to be focusing on that and guide the conversation back towards the type of feedback you re looking for  Critiques don t stop when the session is over Depending on the goals for your meeting you might come out with concrete decisions and a solid rationale for them or ideas to digest  Most importantly you should have concrete next steps to take  We write these up and share them on our  design notes Slack channel  to make sure nothing slips between the cracks and keep other people who were not there in the loop and allow them to give feedback   Doing design critiques regularly and effectively can can lead to incredible results  Some people come up with interesting ideas  others build on top of them and others connect it all together  It s something that a single designer   even a unicorn   can t do on their own,"[207 5 1236 8 523 942 1251 879 1173 189 862]"

235,training-dataset/product/1377.txt,product,Creating a design centric work culture with Marc Hemeon of Design Inc Design Inc  curates top designers and hooks them into high profile design gigs  Since launching in December 2016  they ve seen over  1 1 million of projects come through the platform across almost 300 submissions projects   We sat down with Marc Hemeon  Design Inc  s CEO  to hear his thoughts on creating a design centric work culture  building team trust  and more   How do you create a great work team culture   Culture is the amalgamation of all the personalities and trends and tastes and attitudes of each person on the team  We hire the kind of folks who  regardless of their role or how busy they are  will drop what they re doing to help take out the trash  help the UPS guy carry in packages  or they ll take a moment to recognize someone else s accomplishments   We wrote these values when we first started  and they tend to guide and underscore how we think about things   We believe humans are the center of all design We believe everyone  regardless of role or title  can create We believe design should be developer friendly and actionable We believe great design always starts with listening We believe fast is better than slow and done is better than perfect We believe our struggles determine our success  Love the struggle  not the victory We believe the best efforts are collaborative We believe people matter and should always come first We believe great design flows from a happy and healthy life  Whatever that means for you  we pride ourselves on a work environment that is holistic and exploratory by nature  Want your company to have a design centric culture  Hire engineers who care about the pixels and won t compromise on what they ship  Our front end engineer  Mikey  has incredible product instincts some of our best wins on our platform have been his ideas   Related  What exactly is a design culture   We re flexible in our approach  Everyone knows the high level goals and then is left to govern themselves and execute against our broader goal   How does your team communicate with each other  And how do you communicate with the designers you pair with clients   We all work together here in our Costa Mesa office  Since startups are dynamic and so much changes and happens every day  I don t know how a remote team would be effective   For the broad Design Inc  community of designers  writers  illustrators  photographers  and videographers  we have a massive Slack group where we chat and communicate each day  Folks direct message me and the team every day and we do our best to build out the features and address issues as they come up   Can you talk about giving great  actionable feedback  And how do you criticize work without crushing someone s soul   If someone s ego gets hurt  it says more about the person than the person giving feedback  Here s what we follow for our design critiques   In general  please keep the spirit of Judy Reeves in mind while you do your critiques  remembering a critique is not criticism   Criticism passes judgement   Critique poses questions  Criticism finds fault   Critique uncovers opportunity  Criticism is personal   Critique is objective  Criticism is vague   Critique is concrete  Criticism tears down   Critique builds up  Criticism is ego centric   Critique is altruistic  Criticism is adversarial   Critique is cooperative  Criticism belittles the designer   Critique improves the design  What catches your eye when you re looking at someone s portfolio  What makes you immediately move onto the next applicant   I gravitate towards work that was designed and then was engineered and shipped into the real world  The ability for a designer to tell a story and advocate to stakeholders for their point of view is one of the most under utilized skills a designer can have   Related  8 things to know about building a design portfolio  I also love when designers take a moment to identify what their role was in the project and are quick to give others credit  I get turned off when I see a bunch of glossy concept work that never sees the light of day   You d be shocked how many portfolios say  coming soon   or only have 1 or 2 pieces of work  If I have to hunt to find your work  I m moving on   What can teams do to build trust with each other   Building trust is the cornerstone for healthy teams  If no trust exists  then every time a team member asks for something  it ll be looked at with contempt   Eating lunch or dinner together and getting out of the office together allows folks to bond and share their backstories  We ve also gone out and done escape rooms and multi day offsites and in general we try to spend a lot of time with each other   Trust takes months to develop  And once you lose trust  it s almost impossible to get it back   How does your team use InVision   We use it all the time to build prototypes and share mocks  We love how InVision makes it easy to drag and drop graphics and instantly create life like prototypes that help us think through an idea   Where do you see design headed in the next 5 10 years and how should designers prepare for that   Design is headed from the art studio to the board room  so designers should brush up on their soft skills and business acumen and spend some time learning about marketing  sales  accounting  and all the other aspects of running a business   In the future  the best designers will be those who can help unify and focus stakeholders and users   What s your best advice for young designers   Have a point of view and an opinion about what you re designing and why   Always do what you say you re going to do  If you say you will have work done by tomorrow then you have to do whatever it takes to get it done  Being reliable will help you more in your career than being good   It s okay to do free design work  There are going to be times where you want to work with a certain person or company  and the only way to make that happen is to compromise your rate or even do a little pre work  Some of your best relationships and work will come from this  And yes  the money will follow   You can copy  but never plagiarize  When you see a design pattern you like  it s fine to try and create the pattern yourself  but add your twist and your point of view  Never pass off someone else s work as your own  That s just lying and it s bad karma   Raise your rates every year   Drink plenty of water   Read more interviews with top designers,"[235 862 5 8 523

for designers to thrive  they must be interested in learning and improving their process   At this point  you re probably thinking  whoa  this is a very long list of skills   Yeah  It is   That said  it s important to note that a generalist s experience can be light in some areas and deeper in others  It s common for generalists to have areas of strengths and weaknesses  Some generalist designers are more UX oriented  while others excel at visual design   When building a team of generalists  balance the strengths and weaknesses amongst the team  The diversity will raise the bar for everyone   Conclusion  Percolate has thrived thanks to a team of generalist product designers  Designers benefit from a greater sense of ownership and user research  and the organization benefits from an

242,training-dataset/product/1257.txt,product,The economics of designCommercial outcomes drive the majority of business decisions  To be effective as designers  we must recognize this fact   Design is seen as many things by many people  It s aesthetics  It s structure  It s functionality  It s an outlet  It s a process  It s a cost center or maybe it s a profit center   Regardless of the view  our job as  designers  is to engage in a design process that produces output  This output has to create real value for people  Enough value that  they re   the business and the business s customers  willing to pay for it   The economics of design isn t spoken about enough  It isn t written about enough  And from my experience  it s something that isn t well understood by many design teams   Ask yourself this  Could you put a dollar figure to the impact each of your design decisions has  If you can t  then the economics of design aren t taken seriously enough within your organization   This is a big problem  But it can be solved   It s time to start with the numbers  Wait  You ve got to start with people  IDEO says start with desirability   In reality  this is not true  Design processes typically start with a business objective or series of insights  These serve as a frame of reference   Starting with the numbers doesn t actually impact the process negatively  It doesn t result in less human centricity  It does provide a foundation from which we can understand the business value our design process helps create   Once we have this foundation  we re free to execute our human centered design process   Here are 3 practical steps you can take to embed the economics of design into your organization   1  Onboarding  Onboarding is the best time to begin embedding commercial focus across design functions  In fact  if you can factor economics into the hiring process  you ll be even better off   I m not saying go into the depth you d expect from David Skok  But  when you re onboarding new people across the design function  they need commercial context   Related  5 key lessons for successful user onboarding  As an example  part of your onboarding may be pairing a new designer with an existing designer  Another part of the process may involve the new designer in some anthropological research  Or maybe you involve them in analyzing real time quant to show how inferences from key event triggers you re tracking impact design decisions   Each of these activities can have value   If the new team member asks the question   How might this design hypothesis I we have impact the commercial objective   then your onboarding activities have likely been very successful   Commercial  awareness  is a great proxy in the early stages   The specific activities you design to help build commercial awareness are up to you  My advice is to add a commercial layer to each of your existing activities  This is the simplest and least disruptive tactic   As an example  if your new recruit is paired with an existing team member  have the existing team member explain how the commercial objectives and unit economics impact her design hypotheses and process   This foundation will give all new recruits the commercial awareness they require to contribute to the sustainable operation of the design function   2  Design process  The design process and business function should be sustainable  It should justify its existence through strong ROI  For design leaders to do this  commercial focus must find its way into existing design processes   Formal design reviews are an incredible opportunity to factor economics into the design process   In fact  here s a template you can use for your design reviews  It ll help embed commercial focus into collaborative design activities   You can read more about how to use the template here   Design sprints can also be a deeply commercial activity  They re an opportunity to engage cross functional business stakeholders in the design process  They help build shared understanding and buy in from departments like finance  compliance and customer service if done right   To achieve this  you ll likely have to make a few changes to your design sprint process  Here are 3 changes that have worked particularly well for our team   Then there s our daily process  You might practice Lean UX  You may have miraculously found a way to embed research and design into a software development practice like Scrum  Or you might operate your own unique hybrid model  Regardless of the process you re comfortable with  bring in that commercial lens to everything you do   This means justifying the commercial hypothesis associated with design hypothesis  It means balancing the needs of the business with the needs of customers  And it means viewing each and every interaction your product enables as an opportunity to create value for people  as well as extract value from them   Doing this only becomes possible if you have a means to quantify   3  Measurement  What we measure matters  We know this   As an example  let s say we re focused on decreasing the Time to Value  TtV  for new users  We ve designed an action oriented progressive onboarding pathway that supports this objective  Maybe we re even using something like Intercom to help with this process   From a commercial perspective  we need to understand the impact of TtV on the business  So  if we decrease the TtV by an entire day  what impact does it have  If a specific message is sent post a specific in app activity  how does that impact the in app purchase likelihood  We need to quantity this in dollars and cents for it to be meaningful   Our industry tends to be pretty good at defining usage success  We re getting better and better at knowing how to support users along the pathway to usage success  We need to become equally as good at mapping usage success  and the real life outcomes it supports  to business success   This is by no means one way  The business has to play ball too   In a simple example  imagine the business shared the insight that a 5  increase in retention nets somewhere between 20 100  greater profit  How might that impact your approach to design  How might that impact the relative priority of a design problem   In reality  the product we work on is the business  It s the thing people see  feel  hear about  talk about  interact with  gain tangible value from and pay for  The people tasked with designing the product need to be acutely aware of what makes the business successful if they re going to make the product successful   Right here  right now  there is a gap for a lot of teams  Gaps present opportunity   A focus on the economics of design will support the sustainability of the design function  It will support teams in justifying their existence and unique value   And it will actually support design output that leads to better human and business outcomes,"[242 1400 701 523

245,training-dataset/product/1239.txt,product,Why you should use design presentation boardsOver the years  I ve learned that there s something more important in my design process than the actual design  getting my team on board and excited  Without that  my design work doesn t mean much   Things sure would be easier if designers could just say  because I said so   We d also have worse products and workflow  so thank goodness it doesn t work like that   These days  the design process is more collaborative than it s ever been  and it s the designer s responsibility to include all comers and process all feedback   That means I m left constantly presenting my designs  listening to and acting on what people have to say  and repeating the process  On some really tricky projects  I find we spend almost as much time in the meeting room as we did in Sketch   Put it on the board  My main presentation tool isn t a slide deck  a prototype  or a collection of animated interactions  It s all those things  in the form of a presentation board   Everything worth sharing  loaded into a central  shareable space  Presentation boards have filled a gap in my workflow by allowing me to collect quick and easy feedback from my team  as quick as I can hit save in my design app   High level presentations  Lately  when I m working on a design project  I m rarely working on just a web page  Throw in a product  app  or marketing site or all of the above and multiply by the dozens of popular device screens and capabilities currently available  and you ve quickly got a lot of moving pieces   As a modern designer  I don t just share a single PSD or Sketch file and call it quits  I m on the hook for prototypes  animations and interactions  user experience  and more  While I m capable of designing and building such a wide gamut  presenting every last bit can get tricky   That s where a design presentation board comes in handy  It s a quick and organized way to show everything your design has to offer  Instead of emailing someone only a design source file  or just a link to a working prototype  you can include everything in one space   A presentation filled with design source files and mockups  working prototypes  and even full motion animated GIFs paints the entire picture  It shows all levels of your design and planning  beyond what a single tool or mockup can accomplish   It s great when a designer can use any tool necessary to get the job done  and it s even better when presented in a way that makes you forget all that noise   Share now  share later  I m not sure the last time I presented an honest slide deck  Meaning  a presentation made entirely in Keynote  or Google Slides  or shudder Powerpoint   When I m speaking with a group  I almost always hop around from a few slides to design  to linked website  to live Sketch file I go nuts   Replacing the traditional slide deck with a board just made too much sense  Aside from being easier and quicker to build  hellllllo  drag and drop   they re built from my original design files  which makes for some seriously easy sharing   And that sharing isn t just limited to the meeting or presentation itself  Since the board lives at a shareable URL  you can easily distribute the board before your meeting takes place   Meetings are most productive when everyone comes ready with something to discuss  and sharing design early and often helps make that happen   Even better  people on your team can keep the board as a meeting takeaway  and give more time and thought to the sticky issues that came up during the meeting  Boards are the perfect tool for those sleep on it moments  My favorite design feedback always starts with  After some thought     Collaboration  Once you ve used a presentation board to share design direction  it s time to flip around and use them to collaborate  Boards are ideal for collecting feedback  facilitating the handoff  and documenting finished design   Inviting your team members and stakeholders to comment on anything and everything inside your shared board will help you catch problems before they hit production  No matter how much I think I ve covered my bases  new sets of eyeballs always seem to find something   A board loaded with source files and notes is also a smooth way to make the designer developer handoff at the start of the dev build  assuming there is a handoff at all  you unicorn    Now that I m able to organize and group files  along with notes in context  I certainly don t miss those long back and forth email exchanges   A single board with a bunch of people contributing is something magical  It s like a live design pulse of your project  with in progress and completed designs showing up fresh out of the oven   A shared space for design and notes is even more important when you ve got some non design  non technical people on your team  Explaining the design direction and features to everyone on the team  regardless of know how  is a great way to keep everyone moving in the same direction and with the same level of confidence   Get your whole team on board  Designers aren t just on the hook for design anymore  We re team leaders  responsible from bringing everyone along on the ride  Doing so requires taking the time to present a well organized  convincing design plan,"[245 5 8 523 189 1173

261,training-dataset/business/535.txt,business,Defining Product Design  A Dispatch from Airbnb s Design ChiefThis article is by Alex Schleifer  VP of Design at Airbnb  Prior to his current role  he was the SVP of Design and Creative Director of Say Media  He also co founded creative digital agency Sideshow and UX Magazine  where he ran editorial until its acquisition   My fellow designers  we find ourselves in an accidental profession   Take Airbnb s design team  It includes a former librarian  mechanic  life insurance agent  therapist and modern dancer  Driven by creative pursuits  their paths eventually led them to design  I m thankful that happened  but I can t help but think how many other brilliant  potential designers have veered away from the profession  I know this happens often   it s why we go through incredible lengths to find designers   This might be surprising coming from Airbnb  known by many for its design centric culture and two RISD educated co founders  but it s true   and not alone  I ve spoken to design leaders at Apple  Google  Facebook and other companies with growing design organizations  and they re all familiar with this phenomenon  It seems there are not enough designers to meet the demand  Early stage companies especially feel the pain  Every week  I hear from startups or mid sized companies that have immense promise  but that struggle to find designers   Even if it s a top of the funnel problem  it s unreasonable to ask companies to wait for designers to surface in due course   and not an option for many startups with limited runway  The kid hacking video games and sharing his modifications on the internet  The science major who by chance made a stellar promotional poster for his buddy s band  The talented illustrator who learned Photoshop to do a side gig for her founder friend  I may not have found my way if my mom hadn t been an artist who believed design could be a profession  There are so many paths that can lead to design and so many variations of the role  Without a clearer route to the funnel  we ll keep relying on serendipity to find the next generation of designers   Before companies can create a receptive environment for design professionals   and a more defined career path industry wide   it may be helpful to identify some of the main challenges holding our profession back   Weak marketing   and education   around design roles  Outside of design  some have knowledge of UI and UX  but  by and large  design doesn t enjoy the same broad understanding as its product oriented counterparts  Increasingly  there s more of a grasp of brand and marketing design  but product design   and specifically interaction design   is not well defined or understood  For a field that s accountable for defining the experience of interactive digital products and platforms   products that are an increasingly big part of everyone s daily lives   there should be more fluency outside the function  A broader understanding will help get design out of its echo chamber and into the greater narrative of a company building   Nonstandard organizational structure  Relative to engineering and product management  which typically have clear reporting paths  many companies organize their design teams in a myriad of different ways  Some follow an agency model  where designers float from project to project to support the entire organization  It s an easy default for companies  because they can graft in the design function at any time  Others structure the function to help define the entire product from start to finish  with a design leader reporting alongside engineering and product into the same executive  There are also companies that have the design team reporting into Product  Or Engineering  Or Marketing  As a design community  the sooner we can structure design in a coherent and relatively uniform way  the easier it will be to foster design cultures and career paths within and between companies   Fewer mainstream role models  Engineers have Bill Gates  Mark Zuckerberg and Marissa Mayer  PMs have Sundar Pichai  Reid Hoffman and Kevin Systrom  When considering designers who are founders  chief executives or leaders  I d bet that very few outside the design world can drum up a name beyond Jony Ive or Yves B har  if even those  And those are both industrial designers  Would they cite Joe Gebbia and Brian Chesky as designers   or just founders  Recognition for recognition s sake is not the goal  but it is an indicator of the maturity of the function and the visibility that comes at the top of the ladder for a profession  Just as a tech ecosystem flourishes with more exits  a function becomes more expansive as it produces role models and aspirational leaders   Designers  if we constituted a nation  who would we put on our currency   Three Ways to Proactively Create A Design Friendly Organization  The challenge facing the design function has less to do with how roles are compensated and more with how a company positions the function within the organization  By and large  we ve found our way in the dark  The need and demand is there  but the path in and through is less clear  bringing us back to the pipeline problem  If the top of the funnel takes time to fill  here are proactive steps that companies can take to attract design talent and ways design leaders can better guide us forward   Fuse Engineering  Product and Design from the start   At some tech companies   Airbnb included   the engineering  product and design teams are hitched and commonly referred to as EPD  By design  each function is involved and aligned from a product s inception to its launch  For example  a working group for a new feature  product marketing or user feedback will involve at least one member from each of the three teams  This coalition not only assembles the key builders of the product  but  as a byproduct  it also formalizes the professional pathways that a person who wants to create a product can consider   The team should resemble a three legged stool  in which each leg represents one of the three areas that helps build a product  If it s done from the start  Figure A   each function can grow in parallel and proper ratio  Figure B  as the broader organization scales   The companies that I ve seen do this well from the beginning have done one or both of the following   Hire and unleash a design lead from the get go   A great startup example of this strategy is Pocket  which has achieved impressive growth with a lean team  When it started  founder Nate Weiner had the engineering and design expertise  but lacked the design acumen  So his first hire was Nikki Will who later became Head of Design  Weiner credits Will for bringing in the expertise that helped create a truly great product from the beginning   Grow design s headcount in step with engineering and product hires  Designers are often hired to  work on the visuals  after a product has passed through several stages of development  This sequencing may not only complicate UI UX decisions for the product  but the chemistry of the teams building product  Weaving in a designer into an established founding team can make decision making feel disjointed  Instead  hire designers alongside engineers and PMs  You may never need as many designers as engineers  but you can fix a ratio early on   I suggest a 1 6 to 1 8 as a rule of thumb  Every product  team and company will have specific needs that require adjusting this ratio  but this baseline should help set a good direction  especially as a team scales   Without those strategies from the onset  you re bound to create an unstable stool down the line  which  in this case  is a shaky product  That might be because no design role was developed at the onset  Figure C  or was added on after the product   and the engineering and product management teams   has already matured and grown  Figure D    The best way to avoid a wobbly seat  or product  is to build each stool with three legs from the get go  What that means in practice is to assign  if there s a founder who can wear the hat early on  or hire design  engineering and product heads who report into the same person or at least peers  For Airbnb  the leads in these three areas are all peers and report directly into one of the founders  This infrastructure has gone a long way to keep design from being a reactive entity during product development   The EPD leadership is not the only place where each function is in lock step  The same three pronged cohort is recreated across every project  with co equal  designated engineering  product and design leads working together  This cross disciplinary coordination was in action as we developed our Smart Pricing feature  which predicts what a booked price can be on any given day and automatically adjusts prices for hosts  We needed to convey to hosts when it was live and delivering personalized pricing for their listings  Instead of using a simple loader  we designed a motion graphic that recreated the feeling of an active calculation  Design pushed this facet forward  which made the feature more understood by users and  in turn  led to valuable user feedback   uncovered by our researchers   that led to refining the feature even further  This type of equal access and authority on a multidisciplinary team allows for astonishingly synchronized and speedy product development that can scale as a company grows   Three elements define a product  the business  the code and the pixels  Give each a voice in all product decisions   For the design team at Airbnb  we take a few steps to make it clear how designers can navigate the company and represent how we hope design careers can evolve for the function at large   Carve out Forking Career Paths for Design ICs  The challenge for individual contributors  ICs    especially when they re designers   is that they can hit a ceiling as they grow more senior  while their managerial counterparts often do not  Broadly speaking  this has less to do with their ability  performance or impact and more with the fact that their skill set becomes siloed and less transferable  if unattended  At Airbnb  a few steps help counteract this effect   Level titles across teams  Peers across functions   whether that is in engineering  product  design  marketing or sales   have the same title  They use the same career structure  from the most junior level to the most senior executive in each group   Promote ICs to the highest level without making them managers  Management is not a promotion  but a separate track  ICs can continue to advance upward in their careers without any dotted lines leading up to them   Taken together  these guidelines can improve the following for designers   Retention   In craft based disciplines like design or engineering  you can allow people to continue to hone their core competency  rather than manage the development of others  Many people leave when this transition is forced  and there should be checkpoints for individual contributors who want to try on management   Concurrent cohort growth   By allowing ICs to work on high priority projects and make bigger decisions  they can keep advancing with their engineering and product counterparts  rather than be left to work on projects that don t flex their full skill set  They can continue to build  bond and grow with their cross functional peers   Mobility  Level titles and on the job exposure facilitates more opportunities for expertise by osmosis   or the diffusion of knowledge   across functions  As a designer becomes more senior  she picks up more and different expertise from her engineering and product counterparts  With a greater working knowledge  designers have the option to move to  other legs of the stool  based on past projects  interest level and skill set   It s time to redesign design  We can either go toward industry standards or industry stagnancy   Surface New Tools And Establish A Vernacular  I admit that I still find it difficult to move away from Photoshop  It s second nature  just as a pencil or an architect s table were once tools that designers saw as an extension of their hand  The same muscle memory builds around the software we choose   some of which we ve been using for two decades and hack on to keep relevant and useful   Granted  we have our experimenters  but it should be someone s role to try and integrate new design tools  That s why  at Airbnb  we invest in a design ops team  similar to devops  to help the design team move faster at scale  This team ensures that design tools fit cohesively with those used by engineers  PMs and all other functions across the organization  For example  to help bridge engineering and visual design  Design Ops created a plugin for Sketch and a working process that automatically makes the latest master Sketch files available to any designer  That way there s no confusion around which designs are the most current  Taken together  these incremental improvements not only help to sync our cross functional teams  but also free up designers to focus on their craft and creativity   Even if you can t spring for a separate design ops team  take smaller steps to integrate tools and make structural adjustments to make life easier  Build up to this level of integration with the basics  Standardize your conventions as much as possible so people reinforce the same language as they use it  This applies to developing a design system as well as more mundane practices like agreeing on how to name files  where to store them and how to manage versions  Everyone sticking to a convention is far more important than finding the perfect convention   That type of integration and discipline laid the groundwork for establishing our design language system  DLS   which is not only a language of iconic visual choices and patterns but a system where designers and developers build together  One of the DLS s key goals is for designers and developers to define new components together and once named  those components are built across iOS  Android  Reactive Native and web  So while the components are built in different environments by developers  they are called the same name and have the same core behaviors for everyone across the company   Airbnb s Design Language System Component Page  When these systems are linked  a company can start to cement a shared vocabulary across all disciplines  This not only improves communication but also increases others  exposure to the design process throughout the company  Some of our homegrown efforts  like our native component browser and Airshots  permits any Airbnb employee to access thousands of screen permutations instantly  Any of my colleagues can see any screen from any version of our app in any language on any device that we support  With this broad visibility and use  we are more aware of our process so as to keep the system sound  As designers  that might mean removing layers of abstraction between designs and the final product to reduce congestion and confusion  This type of housekeeping helps everyone focus on their contribution to building a great product   Ultimately  the latency in testing out tools starts early  The students who we see emerging from design school haven t experimented enough in this area  If schools have a hard time keeping up with teaching new tools  graduates hit walls when they join startups  Designers already prefer not to change their toolset  design schools would do a service to their students by exposing them to a wider range of design tools  if only to prime an appetite for variety and flexibility   Designers can learn a lot from engineers  who refresh their tools and languages rapidly  They do so quickly  because they need to move speedily to ship code in competitive markets  There are companies with thousands of engineers that move like a school of fish on a shared code base and can adjust relative to their neighbor  We  as designers  haven t yet achieved that level of synchronization with tools  but it starts with experimentation with what s out there and not being afraid to build if you don t find what you need   Ironically  broadening our tools will be just the forcing function we need to standardize how we communicate about our work  Common language across the industry could go a long way to formalizing a design profession  For example  there s wireframing and prototyping  but less consistency when they re modified  such as high fidelity wireframing or low fidelity prototypes  The same goes with mocks  comps  modules  components  elements and dozens of other terms that get redefined from company to company   Compare this to the standards of typography  where designers can speak about legibility and kerning with great confidence that what s being referenced is being understood precisely  Without a level of uniformity  designers won t have mobility throughout their own industry without an extra amount of learning and unlearning that ll have to happen upon each job switch  A standard terminology can help advance our profession without restricting it  At Airbnb  aside from standardizing the way we build interfaces  we make the language we use to build and refer to those systems uniform  Looking ahead  we hope that how we ve started to talk about product design internally will also have currency outside of Airbnb  We welcome a future where the Googles  Facebooks and Ideos of the world convene to build a library of terms that could set the industry standard  We ve started sharing elements of our design philosophy in hopes of prompting such a conversation and collaboration   A dictionary is full of words with fixed definitions  but therein lies every element needed for poetry   Perhaps because design is visual  there s a tendency to get soft and romantic about it  We often get caught up in our hues and fonts  animations and illustrations that we forget there can be a firm backbone that would give our profession better posture  The film industry has conferences during which new tools are presented   whether it is about updates to production processes or hardware upgrades  The design conferences that I choose to attend are those that not only discuss the inspiration and creative process but also dive into the craft  the processes and tools that help designers act on them   Design can strive for sober standards without undermining the freedom it needs to create  My type of designer gets a twinkle in her eye for systems as much as storyboarding  She makes an effort to gain fluency with her engineering and product counterpoints  even in areas that may seemingly not apply to the design process  We should care as much about how somebody mines their creativity as how they use production designers to cut graphics into vector files so that they can be used in iOS and save a few bytes of storage  Fewer designers than I d hope find those types of best practices and technical know how interesting  but they should  for the sake of their company and our profession   There are mechanics behind the magic  The future of design relies on both   Photography by Bryce Daniel,"[261 1024 523 1251 969 879 8 870 701 1308

368,training-dataset/product/372.txt,product,Determining your design principlesOur design team at ZapLabs often found it difficult to compare competing designs or make design tradeoffs   Well  we eventually realized why  Because we d never determined our design principles   Here s how we went about creating them   Inspiration  I set up a design team meeting and required everyone to present their ideas  For inspiration  I suggested my teammates check out Design Principles FTW  which has a great collection of design principles from Google  Facebook  Apple  and more companies   Define design principles  After generating lots of solid design principle ideas from the meeting  the next step was to go deeper and define what exactly those principles were   I set up a second meeting and asked everyone to write down their principles on sticky notes  Then we all put them up on the wall to group them and rank their importance   Maslow s hierarchy of needs  As we started to nail down our design principles  we needed a better way to visualize them  Back in June  I wrote a Lyft redesign article about their design principles  They used a pyramid shape  Maslow s hierarchy of needs  to define the importance of order  It inspired me  so I decided to take this opportunity to give it a try   I printed out the design principles we created and cut them into pieces  I drew a giant pyramid on the whiteboard and put a sample of Maslow s hierarchy of needs next to it  Each of us got a set of principles and put them into the pyramid based on the way we wanted to rank them   Oops  Conflicts happen  Some conflicts popped up  One  We couldn t decide what was more important  consistency or efficiency  so we had a long discussion about it and eventually decided to group consistency and efficiency together  The reason is that consistency and efficiency often differ depending on what project you work on and where you are during the process   For example  our engineers prefer consistency because they already built a style library  As designers  we have empathy for our users because of the extra number of clicks they have to go through  We want retention  We want to attract existing users of a competitor s product to our product   Well  we know some legacy patterns are stopping us from accomplishing all that  Why not explore options that can actually help them run their business more efficiently  What if there s a need to prioritize efficiency over consistency for a specific case   Here s something I learned from going to design events  Don t be afraid to create new patterns if specific legacy patterns aren t working well  Communicate with your engineers and product managers help them understand the special needs  Hopefully  that way you can get your new design patterns into the next sprint   Finalize design principles  We had an idea to visualize the pyramid with pictures of examples next to it  I thought about burgers and how they have bread  meat  and sauce  I tried a few ideas and decided that meat is too specific  I replaced  meat  with  ingredients   as it presents psychological needs better   Here s what we ended up with  Know your user   Bread  basic needs    basic needs  Clarity   Consistency   Efficiency  Ingredients  psychological needs    psychological needs  Aesthetics   Sauce  self fulfillment needs   Principles diagram  I created a diagram with the goal of helping the rest of our team understand the principles and help them visualize the importance of each one   Definition  Know your users  Understand user needs  You can t

Delightful  Your customers will look forward to using your product when it s pleasant to use   Importance  Recently I listened to a podcast by Julie Zhuo  Facebook s VP of Product Design  She talked about how crucial is it for a startup to establish a clear set of design principles early on  Her insights boost my confidence believing our principles will make our products better    A lot of the purpose of having design principles is to really align people around what matters   A good set of principles encodes that so everyone can have this shared sense of what s important for us and what s true to us  When new people join or when your company s scaling  then it becomes easier for them to understand those things that are so unique and so important about the way that you do things and what you value   We care about simplicity  and we care about people  When push comes to shove and you have to make a trade off  how are you  in those moments  as a team or a company going to prioritize  What are you going to care about the most    Julie Zhuo   Listen to the full podcast here    Looking forward  Design principles might not work for every company  For us  it s helpful to have a set of principles that the whole team agrees on  We need principles that force clarity and reduce ambiguity   This article was originally published on Medium,"[368 149 1251 879 523 506 556 1277

399,training-dataset/product/1291.txt,product,How to build and test an idea in 40 hoursThe Design Sprint How to build and test an idea in 40 hours  The sprint is a five day process for answering critical business questions through design  prototyping  and testing ideas with customers  It s a  greatest hits  of business strategy  innovation  behavior science  design thinking  and more   packaged into a battle tested process that any team can use   The sprint was developed at GV by my partners on the GV Design team  Their new book  Sprint  Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days comes out today  If you buy a copy of Sprint anywhere  you can get sweet checklists and bonus coupons with the Sprint Bonus Pack   I asked Sprint co author and GV design partner Jake Knapp to answer some questions about the book from a product management perspective   Ken Norton  How does a sprint work   Jake Knapp  The big idea of the sprint is to take a small team  clear the schedule for a week  and rapidly progress from problem to tested solution  On Monday  you make a map of the problem  On Tuesday  each individual sketches solutions  On Wednesday  you decide which sketches are strongest  On Thursday  you build a realistic prototype  And on Friday  you test that prototype with five target customers  It s like fast forwarding into the future to see your finished product in the market   KN  Sounds great for consumer software companies  does this work for hardware enterprise robots healthcare you name it   JK  It does  but of course the trick is figuring out how to make your prototype  Frequently  we ll run early sprints just by prototyping the marketing or sales information for a product  That way  whether it s hardware or a service or anything  you don t need to make anything real but you can still have a realistic conversation   Eventually  of course  you ll need to test the product itself  Often you can modify what you have  Savioke  who provide robots to the service industry  made their prototype by modifying an existing robot  One Medical Group once prototyped a new kind of clinic by making temporary modifications to an existing clinic  then testing with patients after hours  Sometimes you have to do some acting  sometimes you have to do some 3D printing  It obviously depends on the product or service  but what we ve found is that teams have the skills and tools they need for their domain  If you re a robotics company  you know how to build robots and you can figure out how to fake it   KN  How do product managers fit in during sprints  You outline the role of the Decider  is that the PM  Or does it work better when the PM is the Facilitator   JK  It really depends on the team dynamic  PMs make great Facilitators  They re often the Decider in a sprint  and sometimes when an exec is involved  a PM will act as a second Decider  it s okay to have two   but not more   And in some instances  it makes sense for the PM to be one of the team  I ve seen all of these scenarios work well   KN  What can PMs do ahead of the sprint to make sure they re successful   JK  Well  you know  they can read the book  and buy a copy for everyone on their team  Seriously though  a PM can make sure the right people are signed up for the sprint team  the right experts are coming in to share information on Monday  and that any important execs are onboard  She can make sure the Decider is the right Decider that s crucial   KN  Sprints are an obvious fit for near term features and problems  but can sprints help shape or validate longer term product strategy   JK  We like to see teams using sprints early in the product cycle  The sooner you start learning  the better and it s often when teams are thinking about a big  long term project that they get overwhelmed by abstract debate and questionable hunches    It drives me nuts when PMs just sort of wave their hands and assume that design is some magical creative process that they ll never understand    KN  What tips do you have for running sprints at big companies   JK  There are challenges  You ve got to find the right Decider and get that person involved not always easy at larger companies  If cross group collaboration is an issue  you might want to involve people from different teams in the sprint   KN  What do PMs do that drives designers nuts that they should stop doing   JK  I really like to see a PM dig in and understand design  and specifically  how and why and when to prototype and test with customers  It drives me nuts when PMs just sort of wave their hands and assume that design is some magical creative process that they ll never understand  That s a huge opportunity missed for everyone and for the product    The sprint is a great method for building strong design PM relationships    KN  We re seeing more blending of the PM role and design  emergence of Product Design  etc     what do you see as the future for these two roles and what trends are you seeing in startups   JK  Design is a method for problem solving  So as designers get more sophisticated about their own work  it makes sense for them to overlap with product management and vice versa  The best PMs I know totally get this  They understand how to apply design research and design methods to their own product problems  And when they work with the designers on their team  it s a true collaboration  not throwing things back and forth over a wall   Perhaps not surprisingly  I think the sprint is a great method for building strong design PM relationships as well as building product skills in designers and design skills in PMs  The sprint method deconstructs some of the things that designers do all the time and makes those methods  like user stories and sketching  very easily accessible  At the same time  it also deconstructs some of the things PMs do  like setting product vision and making decisions  and makes them accessible to the rest of the team  So when you sprint  you learn about your ideas and your prototype but I also think you learn from each other   Read more about Sprint and order your copy here    Read this book and do what it says if you want to build better products faster    Ev Williams  founder of Medium and Twitter  Good Reads   Not because it didn t work  or because it s  wacky  or  fringe   We are a little wacky and fringe  and we re okay with that   Medium is off Holacracy  On the surface  Holacracy seems to encapsulate a set of reasonable principles for running an organization  anyone can instigate change  ownership doesn t mean

438,training-dataset/product/957.txt,product,Design for reality  not gloryMany of us in the tech industry are megalomaniacs  We want to build the best and the biggest  We re always designing our apps with scalability in mind  We tend to design for the largest possible audience   What we don t realize though  is that many of the most well known products didn t start with global ambitions  Rather  they addressed a small  local need first and grew from there   So if you really want to develop your skills and produce a truly creative product  you ll be much better off checking your ego and starting small   Stop inflating your ego  In the book Ego is the Enemy  Ryan Holiday uses past examples of famous figures both successful and unsuccessful to illustrate the adverse effects of the ego   While Holiday writes to all industries  not just design  designers will learn a lot from him   His book addresses the type of thinking that distracts us from designing a product for a small audience  which helps you and another 5 people instead of 100 million strangers   Designing with your ego creates a product that s diluted  unfocused  and bland  Consider these hugely successful products that didn t give into big thinking in the beginning   Facebook was designed first for Harvard students  not for a billion people around the world  If Mark Zuckerberg designed Facebook for a billion people on day one  it would have failed  Facebook was online for 2 years before opening itself up to the general public   Uber was originally a black car service in San Francisco  Today  Uber has evolved from a local black car service  to a global ridesharing app  and now  to a service for lifestyle and logistics  In 2008  this wouldn t have meant anything to anyone   Flickr began as a photo sharing feature within an online game  Only after the product had been perfected did the team realize that it could be applied more broadly  In 2005  Flickr was acquired by Yahoo  Today  it has 51 million registered users   Related  72 quotes about design and creativity   Ego is the enemy of what you want and of what you have  Of mastering a craft  Of real creative insight  Of working well with others  Of building loyalty and support  Of longevity  Of repeating and retaining your success  It repulses advantages and opportunities  It s a magnet for enemies and errors  It is Scylla and Charybdis     Ryan Holiday  Ego Is the Enemy  Get out of your head   Designers have a tendency to turn their life into a story  We write a fantastic narrative of our past with ourselves at the center  I helped design billion dollar companies or I worked for insert massive startup here   and this distracts us from designing for reality   We often produce concept work to develop or show off our abilities as designers   What I m suggesting isn t to let your ego guide you toward producing a concept for another billion dollar startup  These companies became the way they are over long periods of refinement and being patient  So we can only possibly provide an undeveloped opinion on redesigning their product   The only reason that we might strive to design for the best brands is to fulfill our own career narratives   As designers  we need to get out of our head and look at immediate local problems that call for unique design solutions  Not only will this direct our abilities toward solving real problems  but it ll also make us better designers   There are often many lessons and opportunities surrounding us  But if we re caught up in the grandiose vision of our careers  these lessons will appear small or inconsequential and we may miss them   If you think that taking on a small project is demeaning to the potential scale of your work  get out of your head  Keep in mind that there s no one to perform for  And quite frankly  fewer people are keeping tabs on your career than you may think  In fact  it s likely that no one is  This can be hard to digest when you re stuck inside your own head   Don t linger on past successes  When we reminisce about our past successes  we forget about the hours of work and execution that got us where we are today  So instead of dreaming about your story  get back to work and out of your head  Start a new page daily  and eliminate any ideas of grandeur    I was trapped so terribly inside my own head that I was a prisoner to my own thoughts     Ryan Holliday  Be a student  For your design work to grow  you have to be able to learn from criticism  Participating in the dialogue of design communities is valuable  but that can also shelter you from the lessons of reality   The online design community is extremely supportive  It s great that everyone can so easily join a conversation  but constantly looking for positive feedback won t drive us to get better   When you design for reality  people will be hard on your work   Although it can be difficult to hear negative feedback  see it as an opportunity to learn  The designer who works for their ego will be defensive during these times and will likely reject the opinion of the offender  We must learn to accept such criticisms if we want our work to grow   Related  5 tips on taking design feedback  The feedback loop between the designer and the client can make products that neither party could have ever made on their own   As designers  we need to realize that we can learn from the needs and conditions of a real project in order to make something new  Whereas  the feedback loop online often recycles the same content over and over again   Thinking small and local  Okay  so you might be wondering where to start  Designing for reality sounds great  but how do I get that first project  Or  if work is slow  what can I do to continue to grow   This is very much my point that often the answer to this is to whip up some great redesigns  then post them online in the hope that they ll lead to the next big thing  But how can you direct your energy to designing for real life instead   Consider the challenge below   Design for the very small  Instead of designing the next billion dollar chat app  what if you designed a chat app for 5 moms  What would that look like  Do you think something original would come out of it if you just focused on them   What would your social network look like if it were designed for the people in your building   What would a payment service app look like for a farmer s market   How might a calendar registry app work for a day care   Would a restaurant use a better interface for how they seat customers   Could high school teachers benefit from an app to communicate with parents   How might a to do list work for a small family   Let s face it  it s all about our ego  We design to get recognition instead of designing to solve a real problem for a small group of people   I d argue that only designing for a successful Dribbble shot is thinking too small  It satisfies our ego  but won t get us anywhere  Would you have taken Facebook as a client when they were only addressing Harvard   Focus your design  Gather 5 people in a niche and start designing a product just for them   Don t listen to your ego encouraging you to get likes and recognition  Focus on making the best possible product for those 5 people   Here s 6 points you should focus on   Involve real users in your designs as soon as possible Solicit feedback  and consider how your product can improve Don t worry about scalability Kill aesthetics  Yes  the aesthetic side of the design feeds our ego  The first focus should be getting a few users  Avoid feature creep  Local problems can be complex too  but try to keep your solution simple  Make sure your ego doesn t creep up on you  Every time you start to really love something you worked on  you should be wary  Your ego must be hiding behind your love   Let s work to kill our egos  Whatever is next for us failure or success we must always continue to remember to avoid our egos   No matter what awaits us down the road  our egos will make everything more difficult   However  failure is the one thing that our egos will help to make permanent  unless we re willing to be students as we move forward  and learn from our mistakes   We must take every moment as an opportunity to grow  not boost our careers   Every great designer has experienced difficult times  You may just not realize it because all you see is their polished Dribbble accounts  What they likely aren t telling you is that when they ve failed or found hardship they take some kind of benefit from it   Finally  keep in mind that many of the most successful people don t spread their work and successes around  So  look for people in your design community who are quiet about their success  or failure  and see what you can learn from them,"[438 523 8 879 1024 1308 1251 1277 235 189 1260]"

466,training-dataset/business/847.txt,business,What Apple  Google  And Tesla Get WrongDon Norman is a technological optimist  The author of The Design of Everyday Things and head of UC San Diego s Design Lab believes that artificial intelligence might only take the worst parts of our jobs  and when it gets smart enough  it will pity us rather than destroy humanity  On these points  the scientist in him admits that he might be wrong  but Norman would prefer to live his life hoping for the best  Because nobody wants to go to sleep at night expecting a Terminator in his bed in the morning   But that doesn t mean Norman isn t critical of the direction of Silicon Valley s powerhouse companies often celebrated for merging technology and design  In a casual  stream of consciousness conversation with Co Design  Norman dissected what s wrong with Apple  Google  Microsoft  and  as a little bonus we pushed for  Tesla  Apple Focused On Aesthetics Over Functionality In 2015  Norman penned a scathing review of Apple s design  We asked if he d seen the company improve since then   I think Apple s products have gotten worse  not better   I think in a number of areas  the quality of design has deteriorated  worldwide   and I think it s because traditional designers have come back  Design is a complex field  and design itself sort of emerged accidentally as a craft  Only recently has it become a real field with real principles  There s a real tension between the people I represent  who care a lot about whether or not people can understand and use a product  and the more traditional view  and the look and feel the aesthetic   Nothing is worse for a company than a couple years of fantastic success    There s nothing the matter with  aesthetic design   Doing that doesn t mean it has to be unintelligible  or making something intelligible and easy to use makes you lose aesthetic beauty and nice feel  but the people who understand how to make something understandable are a different type of people  They come from psychology  computer science  science  They understand the need of testing and data analysis   More traditional designers are more applied artists  They claim they take a human centered approach  but they do it by thinking about the people  which is not the same things as using or testing with people    As design has suddenly become popular  the wrong designs have suddenly become popular  as they have at Apple    I d argue that those of us trained in the science side are not really good at making wonderful  delightful  emotionally pleasing objects  because we lack those design skills  but the designers with those skills lack the understanding of making those things usable and understandable   If only we could bring those two groups together  And that s happening more and more  But Apple is driven by someone  Jony Ive  with a very traditional design background   Google A Culture Of Perpetual Beta We asked Norman  Hadn t Google s design gotten better since it merged its data driven design with decent  consistent UI and aesthetics   I agree with you  I think Google in many ways is better than before  I m talking to you on a Google Pixel mobile phone   Google never finishes the job    I have a different problem with Google  which is that they never finish the job  This is especially true in their software  Google Docs is a good example  Google Docs is a really brilliant concept  it s really well done  For the first time  multiple people can work on the same doc at the same time  But I can never find a Google Doc  They have no organizational structure  A lot of us hate to use it because it s 90  wonderful  If you could only finish the last 10     Microsoft It Had Nowhere To Go But Up  I think that today  the  design  leader is  surprise  Microsoft  I think they ve always had very excellent people in their research groups  But the researchers barely talk to people doing the products  Microsoft has done a good job connecting the two  And Microsoft has had a good group of people doing human computer interaction  They re among the leaders in this field  And Microsoft is finally listening to them   Microsoft in the past  which maybe because of Bill Gates  was very argumentative  They divided themselves into divisions  they fought with each other  I heard lots of stories of where there were great products  but the Office division might say   No  you can t do that  because that might decrease the sales of our product    The people I ve talked to believe that Microsoft is under a completely different management structure that s a lot more collaborative   It also helps to have a bunch of bad years  I m really serious  Nothing is worse for a company than a couple years of fantastic success you get complacent and think you can do no wrong  Historically  companies go up and down and up and down  It s really good to have hit the bottom  to have had trouble that makes you more willing to experiment   Tesla Giving Robots The Wheel Too Carelessly Given that Norman was on a roll  and he does a lot of research and consulting on self driving cars  we asked what he thought of Tesla   Tesla bragged about releasing autonomous cars  but they weren t fully  autopilot    I think Tesla had too many engineers  And they were too logical  And they really didn t recognize the way that people behave  Those of us who ve been a lot of my friends and I have worked long in aviation safety we know the issues  we saw Tesla releasing stuff and said   This isn t going to work,"[466 523 879 8 556 1251 78

475,training-dataset/product/137.txt,product,How to Create a Design Thinking Culture at Your StartupHow to Create a Design Thinking Culture at Your Startup  In the past two years  I ve spent a lot of time researching  discussing and building tools to enhance company culture and inclusion  When reflecting back on my own company and the elements in our team that have been the biggest driver for our success would be our commitment to design thinking  The following points are what I would consider important to maintain for this type of culture   Find comfort in states of uncertainty  Let go of being  right  and more curious about understanding the problem  Thrive from feedback  Share ideas without fear  Here are five things I learned along the way that can be applied to any startup if you re interested in creating this type of culture   Educate everyone on the design process   In the beginning  the design thinking process feels abstract and uncomfortable since you re wading through areas of uncertainty  but the more you can do to provide resources and in depth explanations  the stronger your entire team will be  There can be a misconception that the process to create a valuable product is to make a list of questions or prototypes and then ask users if a feature is desirable or not  Most of the time  these tools are used more for a catalyst for conversation aimed at finding the real problem  which eventually leads to ideas about how to solve for it  Here s another great post on that latter point  At Glassbreakers  we begin educating on the design process in the interview stage  We invite potential new employees to brainstorms and show them how our team works together when deciding to build a major new feature or take the product into a different direction  Once hired  we ll go in depth with our design process via our assets like personas and results from the latest user experience tests  which helps us communicate the  whys  and how it relates to the user experience  engineering and or sales   Have everyone participate   Glassbreakers HQ post it notes from team brainstorm  Having the entire team involved in brainstorms  card sorting and reviews is our standard  While we all have the same mission and are aligned on the same goal   we each have different experiences that influence how we approach the product  It also uncovers different types of talents and a stronger commitment to building the best product possible  Our back end engineers have an amazing mind for identifying edge cases  They help our design improve tremendously by looking at a mockup  thinking through how they would build it  and finding areas that need refinement on the spot   Work modularly   The speed and flexibility inherent in modular design enables a team to be iterative and get the most out of the design thinking process  We ve always used a style guide that lives both online and in a Sketch file  which expedites timelines threefold  While I was building out user experience flows for a new idea last week  I pulled up the style guide and completed it quickly  since I didn t have to create new assets or get lost in how to communicate a certain functionality since it was pre defined  Our engineers easily throw in the appropriate class for styling instead of writing repetitive SASS  We use React classes for similar modules  which has pre existing design as well  These tactics save a lot of time  brain space and makes large changes never daunting since it will get implemented straight forwardly and quickly   Find design advisors that know business   Having advisors who have been in the trenches and understand the balance between design and business goals can help the team see things from new perspectives  I bring advisors and mentors into the conversation at least once or twice a month to review our product roadmap  analyze how we re conducting user experience tests  goals for new features and assess overall product strategy  One of our advisors  whom has led another successful startup design from the beginning  has been critical with helping us balance our efforts towards the consumer versus enterprise product  They have been a huge influence on making design decisions that tie back to our business objectives  which keeps the team focused  After our design reviews with these leaders in the field  our team regroups and is always invigorated with new goals  ideas and measurable ways to track success   Surround yourself with design thinkers   It s been important for me to be surrounded by teammates

485,training-dataset/product/487.txt,product,Tools for designing within restrictionsConstraints and rules often weigh down projects  making them difficult to navigate  Whether they re related to hardware or data regulation  these restrictions can be some of the most challenging design problems we re tasked with solving   We hosted a DesignTalk with Darryl Grant  Product Designer at Hart  to learn how to embrace restrictions and still create innovative designs   Watch Darryl s full talk below  or read on for our short recap   What are design restrictions   Design restrictions range from the obvious to the easily overlooked  But understanding and managing solutions to design restrictions is key  as new problems arise every day thanks to software and devices constantly changing   Here are 4 of Darryl s examples of design restrictions   Software restrictions make consistency in your design difficult  if not impossible  For example  imagine a web app has to be transferred into a mobile app and vice versa  Even just in the mobile space  you have both iOS and Android each with their own menu systems and notification types  Hardware restrictions are uniquely linked to software restrictions  Darryl gave an example from his work in avionics  where hardware was strictly regulated for weight and fire safety features  To compound that  there was a long timeframe for implementing new hardware  At the end of the day  you still have to design for past hardware and legacy devices   Design to take up as little of your user s time as possible   Time is the universal design restriction  Though it s not revolutionary to point out  it s still a critical issue in every project  Refining workflow and time management will always make you a better designer  But don t just think of your time at work keep in mind your user s time  Design to take up as little as possible  It might sound counter intuitive  but usability can be a restriction too  Especially if you re designing for a mainstream audience  understand that they might not be tech savvy  Design for that  They might be hesitant to change  so hold their hand  Finally  it s important to have an awareness of accessibility issues   Tools for dealing with restrictions  Now that you can identify restrictions  Darryl outlined the tools for handling them  Here are 3   Research  Take time to look at other restrictive design fields  like medtech  fintech  avionics and learn from other designers solving similar problems  Use empathy to put yourself in the problem  Communication  Some restrictions can be modified  You d be surprised how even just pushing back against a restriction can open up possibilities  Also  keep open communication with the  bad guys  whether that be a legal team or external regulator  Give a solution that makes the regulator s life easier too  Communication will help you form relationships  and ultimately help you to avoid future headaches   Pushing back against a design restriction can open up possibilities   Design systems  It s a buzzword right now for a reason  Design systems allow you to move fast  collaborate for team generated solutions  and concentrate on the problem at hand rather than the minutiae   To learn Darryl s 3 other tools for dealing with design restrictions  I encourage you to watch the video above  Or check out all of our other DesignTalks below,"[485 35 523 1251 261 1277 8 879 979 969 1260]"
506,training-dataset/product/545.txt,product,Consistency is key for users and developers alikeThis is an excerpt from Designing with your developer in mind  an InVision e course by Kevin Tomasso   Design is both an art and a science  The better you become at both arms  the greater your problem solving skills will become  and  in turn  the better your products   While there are plenty of ways to bolster your artistic skills  what we want to concentrate on today is the science facet of web design   Wikipedia defines the scientific method as  a body of techniques for investigating phenomena  acquiring new knowledge  or correcting and integrating previous knowledge    It goes on to add   To be termed scientific  a method of inquiry is commonly based on empirical or measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning    To simplify that for our purposes  we can say that the scientific method answers questions by asking  why  against a common set of  rules  we know to be true   This still may sound a little cryptic  so let s apply this directly to the design process   When developing a user interface  you need to base your design decisions on some basic rules or truths that govern your product s ecosystem  These rules can be based on already established principles and or best practices  or they can be defined by you as the architect   Related  Determining your design principles  For example  there are plenty of icons that are established in the world of UI design that are immediately recognized and associated with particular actions  Below   check out a handful of icons that you ll undoubtedly recognize and have at least a vague understanding of their purpose   By including these in your design  you re basing your decisions on the established associations that these icons carry   But many rules or principles are up for interpretation and can exist solely within your product s ecosystem  What do specific colors mean within your product  Do you have custom icons  What animations happen after certain actions   These are rules that you define as the architect of your product   My challenge to you is to be more diligent in employing and creating these rules within your products   While you design  constantly cross check your decisions based on rules you ve set or against other design elements you ve used previously throughout the design   Continuously ask yourself   Why am I doing this    Why am I using a double arrow to signify the next slide  Did I use a single arrow somewhere else  Is the behavior the same   Why am I making the border radius 10px for this widget  Did I use a different border radius on another widget  Do I need 2 different values or should I choose one   Why does this subheading have a 17px font size  Have I used 18px everywhere else in similar situations  Do we really need to have both a 17px and 18px option   Why is the margin between these 2 elements 10px and the margin 20px in a similar situation  What is the rule for space between elements   Why am I using this shade of gray for the background of this sidebar  Is this consistent with the background of a similar use case   Ask why  All  The  Time  Programmers are logical creatures  If it appears to them that something violates the rules you set forth  on purpose or inadvertently   they will either call you on it or blindly add unnecessary lines of code to the project  Both scenarios end up wasting time   Setting rules without becoming a robot  You may be thinking   If I m constantly second guessing why I m doing something  that will hamper my creativity and hurt my design process    Being diligent with rules shouldn t handcuff the artistic side of your design  Instead  it should allow you to identify the best way to represent recurring elements or themes within your design   You definitely shouldn t try to define all the rules at once  either   In fact  this doesn t have to change the way you begin your design process at all  If your normal process is to lay out the homepage in Photoshop and use that to formulate the look of the inner pages  that s just fine   As you continue to work  start to compare elements that you put down on the screen with elements from the pages you ve already completed  Are you being consistent  Ask similar questions to the examples above and allow your design to organically form the rules for you   You don t need to know that you want every paragraph to have 20px of bottom margin from the get go  but after you realize it works well across a few different scenarios  make it a rule  Now that you know the rule  go back through your designs and make sure all pages that you ve already laid out follow this rule as well  Use it in all similar situations moving forward   See  Design is easy   Style guides to organize your designs  Style guides are one of the best ways to keep your rules organized and ready to use  There are many different ways to formulate a style guide  but at the very least these should contain colors  elements  and type that will be reused throughout the design   I like to take it a step further and actually write a brief description of what the elements are used for  This helps me answer my own  Why am I using this particular element here   questions and stay consistent   Style guides can also be leveraged within your layout programs  Specifically with Sketch  you can create Symbols for these elements and simply place instances of them throughout your designs   One of the main mantras of coding is DRY it stands for Don t Repeat Yourself  You already created a sidebar background with the perfect background color  border  shadow  and heading  so why go through that all again  Simply place a symbol or object style down and fill it in with the new information   Knowing your rules and reusing them while you work will drastically speed up your design process   The ol  bait and switch  Throughout this post  we ve been talking about the science and logic behind design  These things sound quite  programmy  in nature like they re put in place exclusively to keep code clean and help developers   While this is true  in the long run you re actually improving the experience for the end user just as much  if not more   Whether we realize it  as humans we respond to systems and consistency   Ever been referred to as a creature of habit    A website that has a strict set of rules and consistency will simply feel better to users than one that is more arbitrary in its construction  They may not consciously realize or understand it  but it will come across in the end   Ever hear clients ask for a  professional  and  clean  design  This is largely what they re referring to   Think about the aesthetic rules of your product as you work it s one of the cornerstones of designing for development  Few other techniques will improve both the user experience and codebase to a greater extent  Make a concerted effort to do so on your next project  and you ll immediately be a better designer than you were yesterday   Read the next chapter  Learn to work with developers  not against them  in this free e course by

515,training-dataset/product/555.txt,product,Recap  The power of form factor storytelling and design thinkingCreativity and design are just part of Stephen Gates  DNA  As a kid  he self published books on the printing press in his basement with his creative director dad  He went on to study computer graphics at Syracuse before eventually heading up the entire global design team at Citi   In an AMA hosted by Designer Hangout  Stephen shared ways you can crank up the power of design in your organization by building trust company wide  how to integrate research in your design cycle from beginning to end so it can be applied with purpose  and much more  Here are some of the highlights from his AMA   When asked about design team leadership coming into a new company  Stephen explained that for the first few months  he observes  So many people come into new design leadership positions with tons of ideas and they try to inject those ideas without actually understanding the deep set problem areas that already exist in design teams and organizations   So Stephen spends time listening and observing so that he can clearly identify major pain points and address those first  Then he focuses on process  culture  and creativity   If we re going to do anything innovative  you have to get the basics right first   sdgates  DesignerHangout   Dorian Freeman   dorianshmorian  September 21  2016  When asked about how he s achieved so much success leading studios all over the world  he had this to say    Most companies I ve worked with aren t short on ideas  they re short on leaders and people who understand how to get those ideas out the door     Building a coachable  tierable design culture where you can say   Our process is the way that we do things  our culture defines who we are  and our creativity defines our value   is very important  A lot of it is putting those 3 pillars in place    He also explained the secret behind his hiring process    When hiring  focus on the ability to think  passion  hunger  and chemistry  Hire people you really believe in    Someone asked how he maintains sanity and a cohesive design methodology across all of the studios  Stephen answered    One of the first steps was to create our Citi Digital Design Language  It s an Atomic Design system with a scalable series of design elements that are organized into bigger and bigger modules  It s form factor agnostic  it s responsive  and it s ADA compliant  We installed it into the middle of the design organization and it gave us a common vocabulary that creates visual consistency  It s housed on a website instead of a PDF because it s a living document and it expands from there  It allowed the designers to focus on actual design     People will support what they re a part of   Invite them into the design process   sdgates  DesignerHangout   Anita Y Cheng   anitaycheng  September 21  2016  An attendee then asked about Stephen s team structure    Our team is broken out into pods of people  Each one is made up of a creative director  a designer  a writer  a prototyper  a producer  and a strategist  So basically it s a mini agency  There are multiple pods per studio  and multiple studios around the world  It allows us to be able to flex across the various different lines of business    This recap barely scrapes the surface of the amazing tips Stephen shared during his session  As an added bonus  he s also hilarious  You should definitely check out the full recording of his AMA if you have time   When you do  you ll find out why he mentioned sitting in the corner painting watercolors of his spirit animal    And if you love the AMA as much as we did  you can also tune into his podcast  The Crazy One   Enjoy,"[515 8 523 1251 1024 78 862 261 879 475 1173]"
523,training-dataset/product/617.txt,product,GV s Daniel Burka on design leadershipDaniel Burka believes your designers are the key to solving your startup s fundamental business problems  Daniel s spent his career at the intersection of design and business leadership  He s currently a design partner at GV  the investment arm of alphabet formerly known as Google Ventures  where he helps a portfolio of more than 300 companies solve their design challenges  Prior to that  Daniel spent more than a decade helping technology companies with product design  from Mozilla and Digg com to Google   Daniel joined me on the podcast to explain the real meaning of design leadership  the role of sprints in a healthy design culture  why humility is a key to great design  and much more  If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the interview  but if you re short on time  here are five key takeaways  Hiring and recruiting  moving into new markets  raising venture capital   none of these are the problems of design  But design can be applied to solving each of them  Design is only a fraction of a designer s job  When a design doesn t see the light of day or gets dragged sideways  it s often because the designer didn t put in the time to create relationships and credibility with PMs and engineers  A design culture isn t built from giving designers immense power  Rather  it s the product of everyone in a company considering design to be a part what they do  Two things define a successful design sprint  all functions within a business participate and  eventually  a successful product is shipped  Empathy is a key part of design  but empathy alone isn t enough  What Daniel often sees designers lack is humility  Stewart Scott Curran  Daniel  it s good to see you  You recently tweeted that you ve been designing for 20  years and you re still blown away by how often people in the web design community are willing to share their knowledge  so thank you for coming here and doing the same with us  Can you give us a quick feel of what your role over is like at GV  What does a design partner at a venture firm do  and what are the type of portfolio brands that you ve been working with  Daniel Burka  I ve got a very strange job in the design world in that I work in this fairly large venture capital company  We ve invested in more than 300 companies at this point  It s my job and my team s job to work with all of the companies we ve invested in on their design challenges  A lot of the time  that s working with their design leadership to build teams and create more functional teams within their companies  Other times  it s working with product people  entrepreneurs or founders on the product direction of their business  It s using design in any way we can to leverage the business and help them be more successful  Solving your startup s business problems through design Stewart  We ve talked for a long while about designers looking for a seat at the table and being considered at the front of a problem rather than just being the last visual layer  What does that seat look like  and what s expected of us with that responsibility  Daniel  This is something I ve been thinking about a lot lately  A couple of years ago  a coworker and I went over to London  We were just starting to invest in Europe at the time  We sat down with a bunch of entrepreneurs over a week  We d have coffee  and the first question that we d ask is   When you think of design  what do you think of   Almost always  the pattern went something like   Brand s really important  We need great brand design   Okay  that s interesting  London has a long history of brand design  That s not too surprising  Then they d say   The look and feel for our product needs to be great   and so they d move down the stack of design layers a little bit further  Then they might say   Our product needs to be easy to use  and I think design can help with that   When they think of design  they think of these top level areas of design  While we were asking that question the entrepreneurs were often looking a little bit nervous  It was like we were putting them on the spot and asking them about something we knew a lot about and they didn t feel so comfortable with  It was really telling that when we asked the next question  which was   What keeps you up at night as an entrepreneur   they visibly looked more relaxed  They d sit back in their seat  Then they d talk about all these other things  They d talk about hiring or retaining talent  they d talk about moving into new markets   especially moving towards America  They d talk about raising new venture capital funds  They d talk about changing features and how that was going to affect their user base  They d talk about all these things that didn t have to do with  design   But these were the things that were really important to them  Design done right can be the scientific method for business  We can apply design to all of those problems  but most people  including designers themselves  don t consider these to be the problems of design  As designers  we argued for a seat at the table for the last decade  and in the past five years it s becoming a reality  Entrepreneurs have heard that design is important  They ve seen that companies like Apple and Airbnb are famous for leading with design  and they understand that there s this pixie dust that can be applied that s called design  but they don t really know what design can do  Frankly  a lot of designers show up at the leadership table  sit in the C suite  and they bring a discussion of design craft with them  They re talking about grid systems  design systems  brand  They re talking about these things that are important  but they re not the fundamental elements of the business  They re not the number one thing that will matter if you succeed or fail  I think that s too bad  Designers are  frankly  squandering the seat at the table  Stewart  If entrepreneurs find it comfortable to talk about the problems that they face and designers are comfortable to talk about what s easy for them  which might be things like grid systems and typography  how do we start to bridge that gap  Daniel  Designers should stop talking about their craft  Craft is a really interesting thing to talk about with other designers  These are the bread and butter parts of design  If you don t have good craft  you re just not a designer in my opinion  But designers need to stop talking so much and listen more carefully  When an entrepreneur comes to you and says that their number one problem is hiring and retaining tech talent  I immediately can think   Okay  the engineers who we re trying to recruit  where are we looking for them  What other products have they seen  What other messaging  What other brands have they experienced  What s our positioning  What s the basic systems design between our approach all the way through enticing them  closing them  and retaining them   This is design  We can design a system that s better at that  We can do some testing around what types of messaging work when an engineer s looking between a small startup or a Google or a Facebook  There s different enticements between these things  I can help test against that and figure out which messages actually resonate the best with an engineer  Design done right can be the scientific method for business  One of my colleagues said that phrase to me a few months ago and I ve been chewing on it  The really powerful thing is that designers can make prototypes  they can make designs  that look real  It allows us to test theories really quickly  We come up with a thesis around   We re losing engineering talent because of X  What if we design solutions A  B  or C  Which one is going to actually be a better design system for recruiting talent  How do we handle the phone screen  How do we handle our jobs page  How do we write our job descriptions  How do we close the talent  What s enticement we can beyond a salary that will help us close a great candidate    I know I ve been talking about hiring  but in a general sense I think the biggest risk to businesses  and we see this all the time in the startups we work with  is that there s a great deal of uncertainty  There are all these questions floating around  and you re saying   I don t know why we can t succeed with this   or   If we did A or we did B  which one s going to be more successful  Which one s likely to fall in our face   Design is at this excellent position between engineering and product to really go and test these theses really  really rapidly  Sit in a C suite  listen to what everyone s concerns are   what s keeping them up at night  what is the major objectives for the next quarter or two   and then create more certainty about the direction you should take  That s an incredibly high leverage thing to do for designers  Stewart  You ve said that too many designers see design as their whole job when in reality it should maybe only be about 20   How can designers get away from that mindset and become more involved with core business  particularly younger designers that aren t getting to sit in a C suite  Daniel  A huge part of design is politics  I meet lots of young designers  and they complain that in their organization they make designs in Sketch or Photoshop and they never saw the light of day  or they got dragged sideways and now they re a wreck when they finally go live  or they re not proud of the work that actually got released  That s often because you didn t do the hard work six months ago creating the relationships with your PM and engineering team  building your credibility  As a young designer  I wouldn t discount that  Working in design tools is really a pretty small percentage of your job  Even if you work in a company of six people  working with those other five people is extremely difficult and you should consider that to be part of your job  One of the best ways to build your leverage within a company is to get into a prototyping mindset  That s something I talk to young designers about a lot  You ll get called into meetings and everybody will be talking about strategy and everybody will be bullshitting themselves about the best direction to go  As a designer  even a young designer  sit in the meeting  take notes about what everybody thinks is actually the best direction  and go outside the meeting and spend the next few hours prototyping that idea  Even if you don t think it s the best idea in the world  the best thing to do is to go and give some edges to that thing that everyone was talking about  Instead of everyone talking in the abstract about which product direction to go in  give it some shape  Make a prototype in InVision or Marvel  bring it back to the product manager or the engineer who came up with the idea and say   Hey  you know that concept you guys were talking about in the meeting  here s how I see it  Let s talk about it and build on that together   All of a sudden  you re the person who can give the meat to something  You can put bones on it  and no longer is everyone confused because they re all talking about an abstract concept  Now they re talking about a real thing  That s the sleight of hand of design  The side effect of this is now you re the person holding the object  You gave that idea shape  and everyone feels bought in because they were suggesting the ideas that now you re putting together  That gives you an incredible position within the company  What makes a design culture  Stewart  Is part of this that we need to think about how we build a culture of design  rather than just having design as that one function of the company  What does that culture looks like and how do you maybe advise startups in the GV portfolio to create and cultivate that  Design is most effective when everyone considers their job to be design  Daniel  That s a really interesting question  this idea about a design culture  Sometimes this is misconstrued  One of my friends posted on Twitter that a design culture means that you come up with the ideas and then as a designer I go and solve them  That s bullshit  That s a terrible way to operate  A design culture isn t that you give design immense power  Design is most effective when everyone considers their job to be design in some ways  A few years ago  a woman who was an engineer in a company was talking to me about how wonderful the design team was   They go sit in this room down the hall and sometimes I look through the glass and they re so creative in there   I was like   Oh my God  Creativity s isolated to this one aquarium room in your business  That s so depressing   It s also very ineffective  Where I ve seen design be really successful is where everyone considers design to be part of their job  whether you re an engineer or a designer or a PM  And when I say design I certainly don t mean aesthetics  I mean  fundamentally  are we building things for our customers well  things that ll make their lives better or easier  Everybody can do that  Working with engineers in terms of thinking about product quality and why product quality matters from a design perspective is something that s important for your engineering team as well  This idea of a design led organization where design makes all the decisions is a bit of a fallacy  Even the companies that are famous for being design led aren t really  They re most effective when design is deeply integrated into all of the teams  The role of the design sprint Stewart  GV has written a full book about design sprints  which can be a fundamental element of design culture  At the risk of oversimplifying  all disciplines of a company coming together to research a problem  ideate on solutions  build a prototype and test it  within a five day window  What defines a successful sprint  Are there parts that teams undervalue or overlook  Daniel  The most successful sprints we see are when we re working with the most fundamental problem that a company s dealing with right now  The first question we ll ask the entrepreneur in the pre sprint preparation is literally   What s keeping you up at night   or   What are your major goals for the next quarter or two    If the problem s not pants on fire  it just doesn t ship as often  We re much more likely to work on problems that are deep  core  fundamental  immediate problems to the business  I ve seen a lot of people work on slightly trivial projects in a design sprint and think it s just for fun  We really do measure our success for sprints based on shipping successful products  The other one is that a design sprint involves everyone from within the business  We are very careful that it s not designers going and isolating themselves in a fancy pants office with our Eames chairs The designers so often want to retreat and come back with a genius solution  but it doesn t work that way  In a design sprint it s almost always two or three designers  one or two engineers  the head product person  and then some unusual people  We ll get a finance person in  we ll get somebody from customer service  we ll get somebody in sales  These kinds of people who have direct access to customers and know the core business objectives of a problem are fundamental to succeeding in a sprint  We were working on a sprint a year or so ago with a company called Savioke  which makes robots for hotels  It was critical in the first day of the sprint we talk to their Chief Operating Officer  This person is in charge of making the big deals for the hotels  That guy told us on the first day   Listen  the number one thing with this sprint is  if we can drive up the guest satisfaction index at hotels  we re going to be very successful as a company   The rest of us were all like   Guest satisfaction index   It turns out there s this really core piece of the hotel business that if you can drive up that score  you ll sell tons of robots  Well  of course that s important to us  but if we had been just sitting around as designers and engineers coming up with a delightful solution  we wouldn t have solved for that problem     The Savioke Relay  a hotel delivery robot  is one of the more unconventional technologies Daniel s team has completed a design sprint with  Stewart  You ve worked in some radically different spaces   health  robotics  agriculture  Are there any interesting learnings you ve seen there that can be applied to other industries  Daniel  Just a couple of months ago I was working with a company called Quartet Health  which is in the mental health space  They re based out of New York  and we did a design sprint with them  It s absolutely fascinating  because you re either working with primary care physicians or with behavioral health professionals or with patients  In this case  we were doing a test with patients and it s absolutely eye opening to design software and then try to put it in front of somebody who suffers from depression or anxiety  Designers love talking about empathy  but when you re working in either enterprise businesses or things like healthcare  you really have to get well outside your own head  because the things that are pressuring a mental health patient or a behavioral health professional or an oncologist or a geneticist are very  very different from what we re dealing with  So it s very useful to do a process where you re actually getting in front of customers rapidly  That s why we re incredibly bullish about using sprints in that context  because the decisions you make obviously have significant impact  These are critical things for people s basic health  and it s a way to test some of your theses in that area quickly and safely  The need for humility in design Stewart  You mentioned empathy  I worry sometimes that we use that word without necessarily understanding what it actually means and whether that just masks a broader set of traits and approaches that we should have as designers when we re approaching a problem  Are there any of those traits that you think successful designers share in how they approach problems  Daniel  I agree with you  Empathy is one of those things you see in conferences and on posters  Everyone feels very good about themselves for talking about empathy  What s really lacking often among designers is humility  I ve been designing for 20 years  and all I ve wanted is to be wrong faster  I can be empathetic with somebody who suffers from anxiety and think I understand their life  but really what I need to do is design something and then see real people using it and figure out what s working and what s not working  Just trying to put yourself in someone s shoes is not good enough  Just trying to put yourself in someone s shoes is not good enough  Life s not that simple  Humans aren t that simple  It works fine if you re designing a weather app   What s somebody worrying about at 8 00 a m  when they re about to head out into the city   That s okay  It s certainly better than just designing an app just for yourself  but the real secret weapon of this stuff is user research  We have a researcher on our team  Michael Margolis  who s excellent  He s our secret weapon working with any of the startups  because almost always what s creating uncertainty within decision making is a lack of knowledge about how users will respond to something  Research is a very effective and still very underappreciated tool in the design arsenal  Stewart  Are there any research methodologies or tools that you ve found particularly effective  Daniel  Easily the most effective thing we do is one on one user interviews  We re not using retina tracking or any of that crap  We use video chat software  GoToMeeting  It s someone in front of a laptop being recorded  and a very good researcher  In our case  we use Michael  Just asking the right questions of somebody and watching for their reactions  having them be able to react to a prototype  we do this type of research all the time,"[523 879 1024 8 261 942 1251 78 1173 948 971]"

556,training-dataset/product/350.txt,product,Design thinking in the corporate DNAA DNA molecule that is methylated on both strands on the center cytosine   source  By Christoph Bock on Wikimedia Commons     We started our journey to bring design thinking into Intuit more than eight years ago  We call it Design for Delight  D4D    because it s not about the process  it s about exceeding the expectations of our customers in ways they couldn t imagine  We realized that not everyone had the necessary innovation skills  Most of our employees hadn t been trained  in school or at other jobs  to solve problems with design thinking  So  we needed to build the capability into all 8 000 employees to spur on innovation and ensure we create amazing experiences for our customers   We ve come a long way  And because we invested in building innovation skills into our employee base  we are not only a design thinking company   we re a design driven company  Meaning  we re going from creating a culture of design thinking to building a practice of design doing  where we relentlessly focus on nailing the end to end customer experience  This means that before anything gets built  the whole team   engineers  designers  marketers  product managers   are interfacing with the customers to ensure they understand the problem well  and together  they design the best solution   This is a big change from just a few years ago  where much of our teams  time was spent figuring out how to make our existing technology look good  Today  we ll throw out code and start over   A designer s dream  right  Change the mindset  the skill sets  and the environment to help designers do the best work of their lives   But it doesn t come easy  Leading this kind of cultural change takes time  and you get your bruises   a lot of them  Here re my top seven and how we overcame them   1  Stop talking  start doing  One of the most ironic things that happened to us was to fundamentally miss one of the core principles of design thinking   we talked about it for two years before we prototyped anything  First  it was fancy decks at leadership conferences  Then  when not enough was happening  10 of us were asked to do something else  We were so intellectual   we sat around for months   pontificating how to roll this out  We had so many ideas and kept arguing with each other on what to do  We were almost paralyzed thinking about how to scale to all employees   After months of us not doing anything  Scott Cook  our co founder  came in and told us we were wasting time and asked us to just get going   maybe run a workshop for 10 people  Everything changed after that  we learned so much and iterated quickly  The biggest lesson  you can t steer if you re not moving  So  get going   2  Principles over process  I know design thinking is a process  and I worked really hard to create a diagram for everyone to understand the process in the context of software development  Know what happened  Nothing  They didn t understand how to reconcile this new process with their existing go to market or create an offering process  So  we pivoted  We stopped assuming we had to show the process  Instead  we boiled it down to three core principles that we really wanted our teams to focus on  principles they could apply to any process they were already using  They re understandable  memorable  and repeatable   Deep Customer Empathy  know your customers better than they know themselves  Our employees are out in the field all the time  watching  listening  and synthesizing  not just asking our customers what they want  A great example of this is with our TurboTax customers  It turns out that for most of our base  preparing their tax returns isn t a burden   rather  they look forward to it because it s the single biggest paycheck of the year for them  From that place of empathy  we are driving major changes up and down the funnel   from marketing  into the product  and into the care experience   Go Broad to Go Narrow  recognizing that to get to a great idea  you have to create many  We ve made a ton of progress here   there are sticky notes everywhere  covered with brilliant ideas  But one of the more curious learnings is what happens when we have to pick what we re going to do  More often than not  the idea that s most selected is the one that s easiest for us to implement  In other words  the safe choice  So  we ve had to push teams to remember to pick the ideas that would most delight our customers  And oftentimes  that s not the easy choice  innovation never is   Rapid Experimentation with Customers  Utilizing iterative cycles with working prototypes or live code so that you can see behavior versus just listening to what someone says  We learned a lot from Eric Ries and his book The Lean Startup to bring this to life in our culture  We ve created  Lean Startins    a bootcamp  of sorts  to help teams go from idea to prototype to live experiments within a week  This bias to action is another manifestation of lesson  1  I will say  though  that there has been a shadow to this principle  We ve had teams stop making judgment calls in favor of running experiments  which slows us down  But even worse  we ve had teams ship badly designed or undesigned products in favor of being fast  The biggest learning here  scrappy doesn t mean crappy  So  if you go down this route  hold your teams accountable to stellar design and quality execution  even if the full functionality of the idea isn t built out yet   3  Take the long view  A common trap for us is to take something in its infancy and try to scale it big  Build it  Launch it  Move on  Well  it doesn t work like that  Remember how long it took before you mastered design thinking  This isn t something that you have people try once and then expect them to get it  It takes about six to 10 experiential  immersive  contextually relevant experiences before someone finally  gets  it and can make it their own  Eight years later  we re still building this skill into our employees  one experience at a time   4  Don t bother measuring why design thinking is a must do  The best advice I got from an SVP at the company was to stop wasting my time trying to find metrics to prove that Design for Delight was worth doing  It was such a relief  Because the fact of the matter is  you ll never be able to show causality between the technique by which you design an experience and the financial outcomes of that experience  Ever  It s an investment in your employees to make them more capable of solving the right problems in the best way for your customers  And there s enough evidence in the industry and on your most successful teams that design thinking is the way to do it  So  take the leap   5  Quality over quantity  About a year into the Innovation Catalyst program  we were pulling together our third or fourth round of training  We started to introduce folks to new methods for each of the principles   like digital mind mapping  a new format of a need statement  or physical prototyping  They had hardly gotten the basics  and we said   Oh  By the way  here are five to 10 other ways you can do this  too   We thought we were being helpful   and even smart   showcasing to folks just how capable we were  The problem was  it was overwhelming  Folks ended up focusing on methods and learning as many as they could rather than helping teams get to better designs for their customers  It was a mess  so we pulled back to the bare bones  From then till even today  we train with the minimal set of methods for our D4D principles   For deep empathy  we take folks out in the field with a design challenge and no moderator s guide  When they come back  we have them fill out empathy maps and craft problem statements  When going broad  we start with an improv activity to loosen everyone up  then usually start with quiet brainstorming  then sharing out  and then grouping  We tend to ask folks to do this a few times  For experimentation  we crafted our own interpretation of the Lean StartUp methodology and created tools for teams to use to help them articulate their insights  their assumptions  hypotheses  and then their experiments  It also helps them capture their learnings from each of the experiments they run   Having these go to tools and techniques   some that are time tested and some that are made from within   reduces the noise for folks so they can concentrate on the content  not the method   6  Give it away  One of the biggest surprises of all the learnings was after the first class of Innovation Catalyst training  We really wanted to incent folks to go out and create experiences for others   of which half the class did  The other half  Nothing  They kept it to themselves  did better work on their teams  and took the credit  Which made us realize  when you want to make this kind of change  it takes a certain type of personality  one of humility and of service to others  So  find the folks that are ready  willing  and happy to give it away  Enlist their help first because this is work of passion and commitment  not ego   7  Be bold  Look  let s be real  We were not done after we got D4D into our DNA  Design thinking is nothing without design doing  We have incredible designers and engineers at Intuit  but there are still barriers that get in their way   our organizational structure  technology  apathy  fuzzy roadmaps  you name it  So  while you re bringing design thinking capabilities into your company and empowering folks  don t forget to use it on yourself  too  Get that deep empathy for your leaders  for your team members  Create experiences for them to get that empathy  too   One of my favorite examples was designed by Lionel Mohri  director of customer insights and design strategy at Intuit  to help leaders understand how they slow down decision making and get in the way  He grouped all the leaders into teams of three to build a Lego truck in 30 minutes  Easy  right  Except  he made them build a deck to justify why they had to build the truck  Then he made them get approval from three different people for the color of the truck  where to put the stickers  and for the timing of its creation  Then  to get the tires for the truck  you had to go to a  Chief Tire Officer   who held all the tires for everyone s trucks  Only one team finished putting the truck together   and they did it by totally ignoring what was asked of them  The experience was so effective in helping the leaders understand how they get in the way that many went back to their teams to apologize and started removing barriers immediately  So  assume you can poke at those sacred cows   I hope these are helpful to you  I would ve never have guessed  as a practicing designer  that I would spend so much of my career building capabilities in others to create a culture of innovation  Or that I would spend so much of my design skills on challenges that are more employee facing than customer facing   But what I now know is that when I do that  designers can really do the best work of their careers   in ways that are delightful to our customers  And for me  it becomes the best work of my own career,"[556 879 523 8 701 475 1024 948 5 1251 862]"

566,training-dataset/product/950.txt,product,Why executives should care about design sprintsIf you re like most business executives in larger companies  you probably keep an eye on the startups in your industry that continually disrupt and threaten your vantage point   You watch as they routinely launch newer  better solutions to problems your customers are shouting for  And while your company spends months analyzing and obtaining group consensus  your startup incumbents are designing  prototyping  validating  and launching in days   You can be just as savvy   One of the most popular weapons these startups are now wielding is a process developed by Google Ventures called design sprints a framework designed to help your company discover viable  customer validated solutions to your biggest business challenges  while also shrinking product development timelines from many months to 5 days  Plus  design sprints provide the tools to bring stakeholders together from across all business and technology departments  while checking ego at the door   At New Haircut  we ve conducted design sprints for the better part of a year  on our own ideas as well as for the companies that hire us to design and develop their digital solutions  What we ve found in working with companies like Coach  J J  and XO Group is that their sales and marketing leads are rarely part of the intimate design processes  At most  they ll summarize ideas in some emails and meetings  hand it off to the technology team to build  and then wait until they re asked for feedback  months later   But as we ve introduced design sprints into these organizations  business leaders are joining the conversation and contributing to the solutions their customers actually want   The big wins for business executives is that design sprints   Solve even the most complex business challenges  Foster efficient collaboration across business units  Provide the best chance for launching viable customer solutions  Significantly condense project budgets and timelines  Let s dig into each of these with the goal of helping you realizing the power of design sprints to achieve your business goals   Solve big problems  Your company s biggest problems tend to be the ones that take the longest to resolve  Cross functional teams need to get buy in  ideas get passed back and forth over emails  and resolution generally tends to isolate one or more of the teams that didn t agree with the solution   Instead  on day one of your design sprint  all of the stakeholders will paint a picture of what they re hoping to achieve and what success looks like to them  as well as failure you define your sprint goal  The very next step is to list out all of the problems and pitfalls that would threaten your goal  This step allows everyone in the room to proactively keep the doubts and risks in front of them throughout the sprint week   And if at the end of the sprint those questions have all been affirmed  you ll have validation from real customers that your solution is viable  More good news  This was all accomplished in 5 days   Fostering efficient collaboration  We ve all tried brainstorming meetings  They don t work because they re typically dominated by those with the biggest titles  egos  and charm  What ensues is lots of head nodding by everyone else in the room  Meanwhile  the best ideas are often conceived by the more creative  yet quieter types   Design sprints give you the power of a diverse group of backgrounds and skills  while allowing individual ideas to flourish  And because sprints are tightly controlled by role  sequence  and time  there won t be any opportunity for entitlement or tangents to sideline your progress   Your teams will learn to work through failure rather than accept it  or worse  blame the  other  department  With a design sprint  you re all in the room together while ideas are evolving into real  practical solutions   Customer centric solutions  How many times has your company spent a tremendous amount of time and energy to launch a new customer offering that falls flat  It s simply not good enough to wait weeks or months to get solutions into your customer s hands   For example  we re working with a healthcare company called Zubia that spent over a year building a web platform they suspected their market needed based on their personal struggles  Unfortunately  their investors and customers completely rejected it   Low on cash and time  but clinging to the belief that there was still merit in the problems Zubia was trying to solve  we helped them run a design sprint  Getting it wrong again was not an option  But as we ve experienced time and again  within one week of running a sprint  we d validated a new mobile solution  Twelve weeks later  we ve launched this solution to market and it s quickly becoming a major success story   Zubia s design sprint not only saved them time and money  but incorporated vital input from their customers from day one   Reduce budgets and timelines  We all want things built cheaper  faster  better  Typically though  cheaper and faster means quality suffers  Sprints  however  give us the tools to accomplish all 3   For example  Mentorina is an education company that had invested 6 figures in an idea to empower teachers in classrooms with adaptive learning tools  But after 18 months of development  all they had to show for it was another learning management system  Like Zubia  they got lost in the weeds of building features they were comfortable with  rather than incorporating critical customer insights and prioritizing the core value prop of their solutions   After a week together  we had not only realigned the Mentorina stakeholders  but delivered a plan of action to launch their platform in a fraction of the time and money they had previously wasted   Wrapping up  Building great ideas into elegant  thoughtful  engaging solutions is hard  Even harder when you and your customers aren t included in the creation of those solutions  Design sprints now give you the ability to have a seat at the design table  And with faster  better solutions that your customers are using and promoting  the better the overall health of your business   And the better the odds you can keep your competition at bay   Have more questions about how New Haircut s design sprints can help

570,training-dataset/product/1479.txt,product,To design digital experiences that matter  design for the 5 sensesOur senses define our experiences  So why is it that we spend so much time designing without sensory perception in mind   There s a problem with existing design practice  Our output blunts the senses  It glues people to the screens they now obsessively interact with hundreds of times each day   In fact  the public doesn t seem to have fully caught on to this  Studies show that people vastly underestimate the time they spend on devices  The near 11 hours we actually spend each day has also been linked to various diseases  It even has an impact on our perception of self  And  as if it weren t bad enough already  it causes damage to our brain   As designers  we should be augmenting human capability  Instead we re locking people into meaningless digital interactions  And we re pumping them with addictive doses of dopamine to keep them coming back   Before proposing how we can support people in living a greater portion of life in the real world  let s explore why we find ourselves in this predicament   Related  10 ways to design for the human brain  Manufacturing engagement  Nir Eyal s Hook Model provides a framework for increasing the frequency with which people use a product or service  It uses motivational psychology principles researchers have been familiar with for years  opens PDF   The model is designed to build suspense and increase people s motivation in anticipation of a variable reward  A reward that we may or may not receive   Key to this is the idea of novelty  If the reward can be predicted  the  hook  won t work   This process  or rather the anticipation we experience  causes our limbic system to emit the neurotransmitter  dopamine  This is the same neurotransmitter our brain emits during gambling and sex  It s highly addictive  It makes us feel really good and keeps us coming back for more   Game designers also employ similar practices  Books like Dr Jason Fox s The Game Changer helped bring together motivational science and best practice game design to expose some of these principles to the masses   This practice of manufacturing engagement is no accident it s by design  But what drives us to do it this way   Scarcity creates business value  In the developed world  attention is one of the scarcest human resources  Major platforms are incentivized to engage people in digital interactions regardless of how meaningless they might be   Why  Time on screen combined with an inferred understanding of preferences equates to greater ad revenues   Effective design balances desirability with viability and feasibility  but certain products have imbalances  These imbalances are often driven by a narrow focus on outdated business models   So to answer the question above  we re doing this because attention is scarce and we re commercially incentivized to win the attention of our target users at all costs   To interface or not to interface   On the flip side  you have the ongoing movement towards so called  invisible design   Golden Krishna asserts the notion that the best interface is no interface  This is part of the picture  but perhaps the idea that we will literally interact with nothing is pushing this theory a little too far  Even the growing movement towards voice is an interface of sorts   Timo Arnall proposes another view  stating    The interfaces we design may become normalized in use  effectively invisible over time  but that will only happen if we design them to be legible  readable  understandable  and to foreground culture over technology  To build trust and confidence in an interface in the first place  enough that it can comfortably recede into the background    So which is it  invisible or visible design   The purpose of technology  In reality  the question is more nuanced than that  However  there are clues all around us  One clue comes in the form of Tim O Reilly s take on technology s purpose  O Reilly believes technology should augment human capability  I tend to agree   The success of our products should be determined by the real life outcomes they help people achieve   I recently wrote an article for TechCrunch about the move towards data minimization  This is critical  but designers should also be focused on screen time minimization  It doesn t necessarily mean invisibility  It simply means focusing on the human outcomes our interactions enable   To do this  designers must actively engage in solving real human problems  The interface  whether invisible or completely in your face  is a means to an end  By focusing on interfaces as a means to an end we can create experiences that satisfy the 5 senses   Design that satisfies the 5 senses  The idea of 5 senses design was introduced to me by Jinsop Lee  His 2013 TED Talk is as thought provoking as it is entertaining   Unsurprisingly  sex tops the list of sensory experiences  It engages each of the 5 senses simultaneously   So  how might we design digital experiences that engage the 5 senses   Where to place our focus  A potential answer to this is 3 pillar design  a framework that supports the design of human experiences  Like 5 senses design  it aims to quantify what actually matters to people  It also aims to shift the focus of design efforts towards human outcomes  Interface design is just one component of this effort   3 pillar design recognizes that people hire or fire products based on what they re trying to achieve  In this model  the product or service exists as a means to an end   The basics of 3 pillar design  3 pillar design helps narrow focus and provides a strong proxy measurement for genuinely balanced experiences   What 3 pillar design is   A new way to quantify what matters to human beings  A complementary approach to your existing research and experience design practice  A new set of values you can embed within your organization  What 3 pillar design is not   An entirely new methodology  A reason to completely alter your design practice  A replacement for traditional business metrics  Let s explore the 3 pillars   Value is a largely subjective construct  It consists of cultural  personal  consumption  and product value dimensions  Each of these dimensions impacts decision making   When human experiences are valuable  the satisfaction associated with the experience increases   In practical terms  value is first about defining the human objective  It s then a process of designing an experience that enables the human objective to be fulfilled effectively   The Jobs To Be Done method is particularly useful for defining and designing for value   Beyond value  great experiences should be memorable  They should have significance   These types of experiences create a lasting impact  We often retain detail about them  We have the ability to recall what we went through  We re also more than happy to re tell our friends  family  colleagues  and the world  our experience   In practical terms  meaning is about defining the importance of an outcome  Then designing an experience that supports the priority of that outcome   A simple Likert Scale that provides insight into the relative importance of an outcome is a good start  From there  NPS or Fjord s Love Index are useful tools to help you dive deeper  Support these methods with qualitative contextual inquiry for the best results   When was the last time you were excited about the product or service you hired   Maybe it was when you were bored one Saturday morning  You chose to hire the cinema by going to watch the latest blockbuster  It had your favorite actress in it so you were genuinely excited about the solution you d hired for your boredom  Throughout the movie  there was a constant feeling of suspense you couldn t quite sit back because you felt like you had to lean in towards the screen   This type of experience is engaging  It entertains our senses and fills us with a rush of endorphins  Due to our anticipation  it also pumps us up with the much loved neurotransmitter  dopamine   In practical terms  engagement is about making the experience of attaining an outcome fun  Nicole Lazzaro s 4 Keys to Fun can be put into practice to help make this happen   For more on how 3 pillar design can be put into action  read here   Design is a systematic approach to solving complex human problems  Design isn t a systematic approach to maximize time on screen   Interfaces are a means to an end  Actively measuring value  meaning  and engagement will give you renewed focus  Plus  it ll help you design for real life outcomes   Through this renewed focus  our customers will have more time to experience life the way they re meant to  through the 5 senses,"[570 242 879 1400 523 78 862 556 1024 261 1277]"
574,training-dataset/product/269.txt,product,The Intersection of Product Design and Business   uxdesign ccThe Intersection of Product Design and Business  Prepared by product design greats for the Supreme Court  this is the definitive guide to using product design to build a brand  market  and sell great products  backed up with design history and cognitive science   We re about to get schooled by the product design greats   Here s the quick backstory  with all the curious information you might need to know  IDSA   the Industrial Designers Society of America   submitted an amicus curiae   an unsolicited brief submitted to a court by an uninvolved third party to assist with a case   to the United States Supreme Court for the ongoing legal battle between Apple and Samsung   It was signed by 113 design greats including the infamous Dieter Rams  and the heads of design at Microsoft  Bentley  Nissan  Lego  Louis Vuitton  Motorola  Calvin Klein  Herman Miller  and professors of design at Savannah College of Art and Design  and Harvard  among others  as a Hokie  I m also proud that two Virginia Tech professors are among the 113 signatories    This crash course in design theory for the justices distilled from modern product design a few fundamental rules  drawing on cognitive science  design history  marketing theory  and consumer technology   Can it get cooler than this   Here s the cliffnotes on what was submitted   1  Design drives sales of products  In the early days of American invention  we manufactured products strictly out of functional necessity  as we tamed the American wilderness   By the early 1900s  the United States became the top country for sales of manufactured goods  but  an undercurrent of dissatisfaction and even embarrassment was emerging about the lack of genuine aesthetic quality in American manufactures   As mass produced print advertising was becoming popular  people started to realize that products needed to look good too   Products in these early days started to see designs that helped them sell   For an example  look no further than the auto industry  initial American cars looked like carriages missing their horses  Ford s black Model T  though successful  was stark and mechanic  lacking design  General Motors put together an Art   Colours department to  study the question of art and color combinations  in their vehicles  It led GM to surpass Ford in annual sales  Ford has never caught up since   Left  Ford s Model T  Right  The first vehicle to be designed by GM s Art   Colours Department  the 1926 Chevrolet   Without changing the underlying technology  engineering or functionality  car manufacturers discovered that they could create many different makes and models simply by changing the automobile s shape  style and appearance   Dozens of different GM models were built on the same three body shells  Yet each model looked unique due to the addition of aesthetic features like fenders  headlights  taillights  and trim   This led GM to come up with the yearly redesigns on car models that we are now familiar with  By changing the design of the vehicles  car manufacturers saw sales soar  Industrial design in the U S  auto industry led to huge economic growth   2  A product s design is the product itself  Put most simply    It is the design of a successful product that embodies the consumer s understanding of and desire to own and interact with it    Think about a Coke  Really envision it in your mind s eye   What did you just picture  If you re like most Americans  you probably just pictured a countour shaped bottle with Coke in it  But think about it   the bottle is not the product  the drink inside is  Yet the bottle itself is what we envision as the product   Coca cola was first only available in fountains  but two Chattanooga lawyers bought the license to bottle the popular drink  Sales soared  as did imitators  The bottle design was simple  so imitation was easy   As a soon to be Chattanoogan  I m proud that Chattanooga gets the claim to fame for being the first place a Coca cola was bottled    They held a design contest for a new bottle to make Coca cola bottles uniquely distinguished  even if only felt in the dark  or seen after being broken  The winning designers used the shape of a cocoa pod as inspiration for the contoured  symbolic bottle  The design killed off imitators and was  the catalyst that  helped  Coca Cola become the most widely distributed product on earth    Left  The original Coke bottle  Middle  The contest winning design based on the cocoa pod  Right  the design of the bottle was so iconic it was printed on cans of coke    In 1949  a study showed that more than 99  of Americans could identify a bottle of Coke by shape alone     The impact of the contour bottle s design on the company s profits   and American culture   is difficult to overstate    But the contour bottle represents more than just marketing for the brand   it has become synonymous with the beverage itself  Customers routinely report that Coca Cola tastes better when consumed from the contour bottle  though there is no difference in the formula   Just like the car  where people were interested in buying new designs regardless of what was under the hood  the Coca cola bottle design proved that a product s design is the product itself in the eyes and minds of the consumer   3  Design is a successful tech companies  differentiator  Design delivers tangible business results  This explains the rise of the Chief Design Officer  and the fundamental three positions found in many of today s startups  the business person  the engineer  and the designer   America s top fifteen  design conscious companies  outperform their peer group by 228  on a market asset value basis  4  Design is the bridge between complex technology and the consumer  Put most simply    Cognitive science explains why visual design is so important to complex technology    Sounds simple  but there s a lot to it  This is the longest point made in the amicus curiae  Let s dive in   Design is particularly important for consumer products with complex technology  Cognitive science proves that a product s visual design has powerful effects on the human mind and decision making processes  and eventually comes to signify to the consumer the underlying function  origin  and overall user experience of that product   Sight is our strongest sense  making up 90  of information transmitted to the brain  This has fascinating consequences  which I broke down into 10 points   1  First  we process visuals more quickly than words  It s intuitive enough  text describing a product s functionality  must be processed sequentially  while  cognitive processing of visual design occurs all at once   It  can be so quick that we may not be aware of its effects    2  Second  since visuals designs are processed more quickly   the connection between an image and its meaning is more direct than the connection between a word and its meaning    3  Third  the brain even retains memories attached to images   pictures  shapes  colors  products   for far longer than those attached to text   This is the reason we can identify a product we have used before based on its visual appearance alone  but may not remember information we read about the product  such as technical specifications or instructions about product use   The powerful effect of visual design  which has been attributed to the mind s  higher degree of discrimination of pictures compared with words   is simply stronger and longer lasting than information gleaned from text   Immediately upon seeing a product  the mind forms  beliefs about product attributes and performance    4  Fourth  research shows that  attractive products are perceived to be of higher quality and easier to use  and that  attractive things make people feel good    In scientific terms  cognitive processing of images has  been found to be associated with increased affect   as  high aesthetics activates the reward center of the brain    5   Customers experiencing positive emotions may feel more predisposed to try new things and may perceive them as having higher value    6  Most interestingly  since more attractive products lead to higher emotion  this means that repeat business is heavily driven by design   Thus  emotional responses and connections to products and brands are  among the biggest drivers of repeat business    7  Good design can even overcome other negatives about a product  and induces the consumer to make positive assumptions about what they don t know about the product   Consumer psychology has shown that   a beautiful product can completely overpower negative functionality information   Thus  when researchers presented subjects with reviews depicting a computer as poor in functionality  but then later showed an image of a very attractive computer  the subjects  evaluations of the computer were just as favorable as those of subjects who had been shown favorable functionality reviews  Visual attractiveness can even exceed what is known about the product   generating particularly rich and favorable inferences about missing product attributes    8  Because our brains to do not separate the physical appearance of a product from its functions  when we see  interact with  or even think about a product again  that experience is  cognitively mapped onto the product s visual design such that the look of the product comes to represent the features  functions  and total user experience of the product itself    Thus  when a consumer encounters a known product  or an infringing copy   the consumer identifies the look of the product with the underlying functional features  Design  subsumes all the other factors     Judgments are often made on the elegance  functionality and social significance of products based largely on visual information    9  Today when we see products we might buy   in print  TV  social media  websites   it s the visual design  not text  that dominates the ad  When we see someone else using the product    a powerful factor in purchase decisions    it s only the visual design we have to go off of   Thus  when a consumer encounters a product  the consumer identifies the look of the product with the underlying functional features and the visual design comes to represent the features  functions  and total user experience of the product  In this way    c onsumer preferences and motivation are far less influenced by the functional attributes of products and services than the subconscious sensory and emotional elements  that are encompassed by the design and  derived by the total experience     The symbolic meaning associated with products often has the potential to dominate the aesthetic and semantic aspects of cognitive response    Consider how well regarded Beats headphones are socially held  when audiophiles have publicly lamented the poor audio quality of the product   10  What s most interesting is how important this is for complex technological products   As products have become vastly more complex  consumers have limited under  standing of every underlying function and feature  Instead  they rely on the visual design of the product to define its category membership and underlying functionality  Thus  counterintuitively  when a single product performs many complex functions  and when functionality is generally equivalent across manufacturers  design becomes more important  not less   As the home computer became more technologically complex  and as makers were putting out functionally similar options  it was the iMac G3 that propelled Apple into its current era of prosperity   It was all in the design for the iMac G3  Cognitive scientists have established that  as product quality parity has become the norm   design is a key method for manufacturers to  differentiate their goods   In other words  when consumers are cognitively overloaded with multiple functions and choices  and particularly where those functions are perceived as undifferentiated across products   aesthetics is weighted more heavily in the choice decision   and consumers are  more likely to select the better looking option  even when there is a price premium    Again  I ll point to Beats  premium price  all for the design   Finally  the amicus curiae leads into its final argument against the copying of seemingly  obvious  designs by identifying the severity of the issue  emphasis mine    By stealing designs  therefore  manufacturers steal not only the visual design of the product  but also the underlying attributes attached to the design of the product and embodied in the mind of the consumer by the product s visual appearance  When a manufacturer copies the design of a successful product  it captures the consumer s understanding of what the product does and what the product means   Moreover  copying of a design also allows the copier to enter the marketplace on the back of the brand attributes built by the patent holder   who has expended vast sums and effort in design  development  quality standards  marketing  sales and product promotion  Immensely successful companies use visual design to build their brands  expending time and resources to implement  systematic planning of a consistent aesthetic style that is carried through in everything the company does   Strong design can  enhance emotional contact with customers  and  create positive overall customer impressions that depict the multifaceted personality of the company or brand   Consumers come to associate particular designs with specific attributes of companies and products  Design patent infringement therefore steals much more than the design itself   it robs innovative companies of the entire positive mental model that consumers have created for their brand,"[574 261 149 523 1024 1109 1251 1187 879 758

665,training-dataset/business/939.txt,business,Every team can get more done with sprints   but it s not just about going fastEvery team can get more done with sprints   but it s not just about going fast  The typical workday is busy  but it s not always productive  We spend too much time on email  have too many meetings  then struggle finding willpower and energy to focus on what s really important  This isn t our fault  After all  as Cal Newport says  we re just taking the path of least resistance   Plenty of authors have proposed systems and philosophies for getting more done at work  My writing partner Jake Knapp created his own solution in 2009  the sprint  It s a five day process that helps teams focus on one big goal  taking them from ideas to prototypes to customer research in just a week  In a sprint  you get to fast forward your project   to see what the end result might look like and how customers would react   But the sprint is not another theoretical model or framework  It s a proven recipe  and in our book Sprint  we provide detailed hour by hour instructions for following that recipe  At GV  we ve tested the process with more than 100 companies  We help our startups use sprints to answer big questions  test new business ideas  and solve critical challenges  We ve seen firsthand  again and again  how sprints help teams get more done and move faster   Yes  sprints are fast  but it s not what you think  The sprint is not an all out  late night  stack of pizza boxes on the conference table affair  In fact  the sprint day only lasts from 10am to 5pm  You ll have plenty of time to hang out with your family  meet up with friends  get a good night s sleep   and yeah  stay caught up on those pesky emails   Why do sprints help teams get more done  It s not just about speed  It s about momentum  focus  and confidence  The companies who use sprints  in fields like oncology  robotics  coffee  and dozens more  see consistent results from the process  Here are five of the most important outcomes   Sprints help you start  When a big problem is looming  it can be tough to dig in and get started  Sprints make an excellent commitment device   when you gather a team  clear the calendar  and schedule customer interviews  you commit to making progress   GV portfolio company Savioke found themselves in this same situation  they had spent months developing their delivery robot for hotels  but felt paralyzed by big questions about the robot s personality and behavior  We planned a sprint  and by the end of the week  the Savioke team had tested a simple robot personality with actual customers   Sprints move you from abstract to concrete  Too many projects get stuck in Abstractopia  an alternate universe where debates  theories  and hunches are plentiful  but concrete progress is rare  For podcast startup Gimlet Media  an abstract question    should we become a technology company     was causing anxiety for founders Alex Blumberg and Matt Lieber   Gimlet decided to run a sprint on the question  and almost immediately had an answer  That s because  in every sprint  you sketch specific solutions  not abstract ideas  and build a realistic prototype before the week is up  Gimlet s sprint helped them see what their future as a technology company would look like  And in their case  it led the team to decide it wasn t necessary to reach their goals as a company   Sprints focus you on the important things  Think about the typical day at work  With all the noise  distractions  and demands for your attention  it s almost impossible to see what s truly important  That s why every sprint starts with an entire day devoted to mapping out the problem at hand  Then  after your team has built a shared understanding of the challenge  you can figure out exactly where to focus   When Flatiron Health began work on a new tool for cancer clinics  their focus naturally turned to doctors and patients  the typical stakeholders for their products  But when we sprinted together  the Flatiron team realized that research coordinators  the folks who administered clinical trials  were actually a more important group to focus on  By the end of the week  Flatiron had tested a prototype with research coordinators and had the confidence to move forward with the project   Sprints force crisp decision making  Business as usual decision making is busted  we strive for consensus  we don t make tough calls  we aren t transparent about how decisions are made on our team  The sprint corrects these problems with a recipe for better group decision making   The leadership at Slack used that structure to decide between two fundamentally different marketing approaches  One approach was unique  bold  and difficult to implement   It was also the CEO s favorite   The other was more conventional but easier to build   Slack could have debated the merits of each approach  or just went with the CEO s hunch  But in our sprint together  we cleanly separated the two concepts  then decided to prototype and test both  After Friday s customer test  the results were clear  the simpler marketing was more effective  and the CEO s favorite  while clever  wasn t as successful with customers   Sprints point you down the right road  so you can go full speed ahead  Your team will accomplish a ton in every sprint  but the knock on effects   the confidence of knowing you re on the right road   are even more powerful   When GV startup LendUp began working on a new credit card for consumers with no or low credit  they had a lot of ideas for helpful features  But they were stuck  without a clear prioritization of features it was difficult for them to make progress on designing and launching the card  In our sprint together  we created fake credit card marketing to test LendUp s ideas  Armed with the results   a clear delineation between essential and unimportant features   their team went full speed ahead with the card   How would your team behave differently if they knew they were right  How much faster could they go  Sprints can give any company the confidence to get more done  not just during the sprint  but down the road  And the best part is  you don t have to make sweeping cultural or personnel changes to make it happen  You just have to try a sprint   This article was originally published at Harvard

676,training-dataset/product/1114.txt,product,Should designers be generalists or specialists Editor s note  We ve asked a handful of design leaders to respond to prompts each week  This week s prompt was  Should designers be generalists or specialists   Below  check out responses from Chris Thelwell and Uday Gajendar   At Envato we have a distributed design team  Designers are embedded in small cross functional teams alongside developers and a product manager  so it s really important that our designers can do a bit of everything   We look for generalists when we hire  We need people who have a wide range of skills  One day they can be doing user research interviewing customers  writing surveys  analyzing results  etc  and the next day they ll be doing interaction work and visual design  At some point they ll also be working closely with frontend developers  and they may even write code   If we hired specialists to cover each of these roles  we d have some problems   Less efficiency designers would wait around for the next task that required their speciality  Loss of context on projects during handoffs  A weakened relationship with the development team  Most designers have one skill they re better at than others  We share these specialities to mentor our teammates and level any gap in skills  A designer with great research skills will work with the other designers to help them become better researchers  We don t give all the research work to the person with those skills   Exceptions  We have a UI design team that works on our Design System they re specialized in visual design  which we like to refer to as UI design  They re expected to learn new skills like Framer js   Information architecture  IA  and copywriting is another exception  We have a great IA and UX writer  she opened World IA Day 2016  who works closely with our designers  Since we have such a complex IA in our product  and because we have a global audience  this is the one area that we need a true specialist   Generalists are in demand  In a product environment  it s essential to be a generalist  You need to be surrounded by other generalist designers who can share their skills and experience   A team built from generalists is a team that can handle any design task  That s the kind of team we need at Envato   This question is a common source of angst among both veteran and novice designers maybe more for those hurrying to define themselves before annual job fairs and graduation ceremonies  And myriad pressures to pick one come from multiple directions  HR recruiters  hiring managers  or non design teammates demanding multidisciplinary innovation one second and pixel perfect assets the next   Argh  So what should a designer be   Let s step back a moment  I ve learned choices such as this  set up in the somewhat artificially fatalistic duality of either X or Y  aren t genuinely responding to the wide spectrum of possibilities  It s not about one versus the other  with jacked up consequences of risks and losses  most of which are in our heads anyway   It s usually never that dire of a choice when framed as either or   Sure  the savvy  effective designer who strives for leadership backed by valuable street cred knows how to strike a balance between this  generalist or specialist  choice  And  by the way  this is typical of most design choices  whether it s setting the max height for a popover tooltip that bumps against the browser edge  or estimating the need for another round of user studies with incomplete understanding of the user profile   Yet everyone around you expects a quick  easy X or Y choice to be made  Hey  it s simplified and distilled to a decision  and that yields action  After all  we ve got tickets to file  blockers to unblock  and apps to ship everything is on a deadline  Chop  chop  What s it gonna be   If you aspire to be a design leader with legitimacy and credibility among non designers  then you must seek an optimal middle path  Think  strategize  like a generalist  and make  deliver  like a specialist   This represents the best possible blend and you can adjust the ratios of that blend as you evolve further in your career path  A choice towards one but not the other may set you upon a particular purpose with palpable conviction  but it weakens you in the long run you re only half as valuable as a designer   It s the mediated intersection of generalist and specialist that empowers a designer to have influence  impact  and ultimately respect  Not to mention  the ability to command a top dollar rate   How to strike this balance   Apply a breadth of knowledge across a range of UX related topics  situations  or modalities  mobile  web  services  wearables  etc   Confidently and flexibly dive into any problem tossed at you  with a set of insightful frameworks to help dissect that problem into its constituent issues  e g   assumptions and dependencies  contexts and emotions    Think like a generalist in your dealings with product management and engineering   grokking the ways to strategically foresee opportunities as you break apart a problem into its key pieces  and segment triage prioritize the architecture  interactions  and flow accordingly     grokking the ways to strategically foresee opportunities as you break apart a problem into its key pieces  and segment triage prioritize the architecture  interactions  and flow accordingly  Draw upon inspirations from a multitude of sources  history  politics  philosophy  even science fiction and cinema  From there  you ll be able to provoke  inspire  challenge  and ultimately enable deep analysis of the problem and potential solutions to help the team move forward towards innovation that improves the human condition   So think like a generalist  They ll thank you later   And yet  the value of a deep specialist who delivers can t be ignored  At the end of the day  product managers and developers don t care about your poetic philosophies of design  They just need to know if you can make with superb tactical diligence key assets by the end of the sprint so everyone can hit the ship date  with a nicely annotated spec   This is where you build up the tangible specialized skills  truly getting deep into how to build what you can foresee   Yes  it s all about craft at a deep level  your ability to specialize in the IA  or UI  or visual production  or even coding prototypes  is what cultivates the daily  aggregative respect from teammates  Proving that you can deliver what you re paid to do  in the superficial  unknowing eyes of non designers  is the key to your success at a basic level  and it serves as a stepping stone towards greater influence and impact down the road  Especially when it s blended with thinking like a generalist about the essence of the problem space   I suggest all designers strive to strike an ongoing balance of thinking strategically like a generalist who can explore many spaces  while also delivering well crafted artifacts that speak to a specialist s focused expertise  going deep in the nooks and crannies of the problem  That s the only way to build up much needed credibility and respect  which helps you towards becoming an influential force for design for a team and within an organization   Join the conversation  Write your own response to the prompt  Should designers be generalists or specialists   on Medium  and submit it to our publication,"[676 237 786 8 879 261 1024 1308 523 1277 862]"
701,training-dataset/product/468.txt,product,Why measuring design isn t a terrible ideaEmbracing measurement puts yourself and your team out there  It openly says that we aren t perfect and perhaps we could do our job better   Through my experience of building the design team at Percolate  my perspective on measurement has changed  I ve gone from thinking measurement is all about understanding the performance of a solution to measurement being a tool that can be used to improve our teams  our design process  and the business we re building   Measuring design hasn t come naturally to me  though  There have been many occasions where I brushed requests for measurement under the carpet  This was partly due to my natural instinct to focus on the work  and partly because I didn t want to expose our imperfections   As disciplines like marketing  engineering  sales  and finance have evolved at our company  I ve been exposed to the measurement methods they use to understand their impact on our business  Because of this  I started looking more critically at how we could measure the contribution of design   This post shares the exercises we ve explored as a design team  Through these exercises  I ve gained a deeper understanding of how our success metrics aren t just affected by the design solutions we deliver  but also how well we operate as a team   Related  Find out why Percolate built their product team with generalists  Success  struggle  surprise  It s important for design leads to feel confident that the less experienced designers working alongside them are making progress  To monitor these developments  we started simple diaries that asked leads to note three observations on what the designer working alongside them had accomplished each week  something the designer was successful with  something they struggled with  and something that surprised them  These diary entries surfaced a range of learnings  including how designers documented their work  what they could do better when presenting work  and when they went above and beyond on projects  As a result of these diaries  I had conversations with design leads around coaching tactics  team collaboration  and project development  At times updating these dairies slipped  but that was okay  We always came back to them as we valued the view they presented on our team s development   Design KPIs  If you haven t come across KPIs  Key Performance Indicators   they are  performance measurements that evaluate the success of an organization or of a particular activity in which it engages   They can be applied to projects  teams  and individuals  For example  a KPI for a writer on our marketing team is to publish 3 blog posts a month  We hadn t set goals like this on the design team until we started fleshing out the design manager responsibilities  We found that breaking down the manager responsibilities by specific goals helped them get a clear picture of what success looks like  They knew how many user research reports we were targeting  how many usability design workshops to hold every quarter  etc   These goals gave managers a target to work towards and helped them be more proactive on the things that mattered  It wasn t easy to put hard goals against all responsibilities  though  For example  the effectiveness of a manager s mentorship style is best discussed qualitatively rather than tying specific metrics to it  Through this exercise I learned to use goals where they made most sense  and not to force them across all responsibilities   Ramp report  The onboarding plan for new members of the design team is a constant work in progress  You want to give people enough info on the company  the teams they work with  and an introduction to our product  Then you want to get them working on a project  For designers to be successful  you want them to feel ramped meaning they have all the information they need to do their job   At the end of last year we did a survey with some of the new members on our team to figure out what worked and what didn t work during their onboarding  We wanted to know at what stage they felt they had a clear understanding of our product  and what onboarding sessions were most valuable in getting them there   The biggest takeaway from the survey was our onboarding for new designers was too broad  During their first 2 weeks at the company  designers wanted the sessions to focus on helping them learn the product inside and out  Once they felt comfortable with our product  they saw the value in learning about the work of other teams  While it was frustrating to learn that some sessions weren t as effective as we d hoped  the fact we could be open with our learnings and make adjustments was more important to our team   Project mapping  Redesigning the page templates we use across our marketing website was a project that brought together people from our marketing  design  and engineering teams  From the outset  we chose to use this project as a test to see if we could record how successfully we worked together to solve the brief and launch the new templates  At each stage of the project  IA  wireframing  visual design  etc   we recorded the time our design team members spent  what was working  what could have gone better  notes on project status  and next steps  We used a spreadsheet layout and color system that made our productivity patterns visible across project stages   Once the project was complete  we were able to see a map of the project from start to finish  From here  it was clear at which stages collaboration was successful and where it broke down  Have no doubt  completing the spreadsheet each week was tedious at times  But it wasn t long before we could see value in the exercise  Coming out of the project we had clear view on the investment we had made  We could also see what practices and assets we could create to help us improve   UI backlog  In pursuit of improving the user experience of our software product  we ve started to record a backlog of usability enhancements  An example of an enhancement is making our secondary navigation consistent across applications  The backlog is reviewed with product management and engineering during planning sessions and a selection of the enhancements are incorporated into our development sprints  This is a big deal  as up until now roadmaps have largely focused on new features  not enhancements   It hasn t been as easy as I ve made it sound  to be honest  as we had a lot of false starts with this project  What was difficult is the fact we had a group of passionate people who wanted change immediately  and on the other side of the table we had a group of people who were balancing a number of development needs  We needed to find common ground so we could plan and prioritize change together  To help explain the value of the enhancements  we identified a set of usability principles  The principles provide a good articulation of the usability problems we re trying to solve  They re helping get all disciplines on the same page about how we can push our product forward   Customer voice report  This is a project we re working on at the moment  It started from a conversation I had with Emmet  We were talking about research best practices our teams had been using to help inform the products we re building  One of the inputs we are both interested in is customer feedback   Customer feedback comes in many forms at Percolate  advisory boards  field conversations  sales analysis  research projects  beta programs  and in app support tools  What Emmet shared was that the product team at Intercom reviews and filters customer feedback submitted through in app support tools to create  Customer Voice Reports   These reports are delivered to the product teams on a quarterly basis for consideration when planning their roadmaps  This idea resonated with me as a smart way to inject the customer voice into our planning process  Once we establish this baseline for the Customer Voice Report  we can look to incorporate other customer inputs to give further context and definition to the reports   My biggest learning from doing these exercises is that my goals needed to be bigger than making sure something gets done  This mindset wasn t going to inspire our teams to grow   Instead  asking questions like   What can design do to help make our customers successful   and   What can we do to work better with the teams around us   has helped me find ways to go beyond design solutions  We ve been able to surface valuable insights on our activity from across the design journey   Beyond the impact these experiences have had on my approach as a manager  they ve created a range of opportunities for everyone on our design team to share their ideas and feedback  In some cases  this has brought clarity around areas that were unclear  making us more productive and accountable for the way we work  Other exercises have created consensus on the projects we should be working work on  where previously we were struggling to find a way forward  The most effective exercises have given the team assurance that their voice is heard and that they can have an impact   These are benefits that not only directly impact how we operate as a design team  but also affect the success of the teams around us  I ve used our learnings from these exercises to better communicate the value of design across the organization  and to inform new tools and processes that improve collaboration between teams   I hope you can apply some of our learnings to your team  We re much better for these experiences and I believe your team could be  too  As we look to increase the impact of design moving forward  I know we ll be bringing new ways of analytical thinking to the table   So despite my doubts  it turns out measuring design isn t a terrible idea after all   This was originally

758,training-dataset/product/1452.txt,product,Design better by leveraging contextNo design exists in a vacuum  just as no company exists on an empty playing field  That means that every product and website design lives in the context of hundreds of other products and websites that our customers and prospects interact with every day   Yet  when working on a new design  how often do we look at that context  How often do we look at that environment our design will complement or compete with for attention   Let s dive into the set of companies  products  and assets that make up this context and discuss how to turn that context into smart design decisions   Who makes up that context  The context for your product and website spans beyond any single company or even industry   Your company  The first entity is none other than your own company  Unless you re a brand new company  you likely have existing customers and prospects who know your brand and your website already  For that reason  they may be expecting a certain design or certain experience going into another visit or login  Simply moving a commonly used button a few pixels to the left can cause confusion to visitors who navigate your website with such ease that they don t even look at what they re clicking on  Competitors  The next step in building out your design context is to look at your company s competitors  What other products does your target market use to solve the same problems  What competitive products have they used in the past  what do they use today  and what are they evaluating  We explored the topic of using competitive data to make better design decisions in the recent InVision DesignTalk  Become a better designer with competitive intelligence  Check it out  Partners  There s a reason you engage with your partners they likely have the same or similar customer base and offer complementary products  As a result  they also play a role in your design context  Since you have a collaborative relationship with them  you may be able to exchange design ideas and feedback  Customers  Anyone who works at a company likely spends a lot of time in the product and or website for their company every day  As a result  your target customers  websites can contribute to your design context  Looking at a customer s designs can give you insight into what they appreciate and what s most important to them  Customers  peers  The same logic extends to your customers  peers  products and websites  It s likely that they look at their peers  and competitors  products and websites on a regular basis  Take a look at the full suite of the industries you target to best understand the broader industry context for your designs  Other products used  Finally  there are many products and websites we all use every day that are not directly tied to our jobs or industries  Find out which products  apps  websites  etc  your personas most often frequent and review them as part of the broader context for your designs  Oftentimes  these additions can offer the best inspiration because they aren t directly tied to what you do   How to identify the right companies  Now that you understand which categories of companies to look at  how do you find out which specific ones to review   Persona interviews  One of the best ways to get a broad introduction to the sets of products and websites your personas use and visit is  simply  to ask them  Persona interviews and surveys can give you great insight into the companies your customers know  love  or hate  Search engine results  Another great way to see who s competing for your customers  attention is to look at the battlefield search engines  Doing searches on your top keywords  or even your brand name  can show you who you re up against in organic and paid results  Partner list  Finding your top partners should be a pretty easy task  whether they re listed on your website already or identified on an internal wiki  You can also ask your partner team for more details  Customer list  The same goes for your customer list this should be a pretty simple task of reviewing your customer case studies  logging into your CRM  or asking your sales or services teams  Sales data  Where things get a little more interesting is getting at the competitive landscape  which your company should be tracking as part of the sales process  Ideally you should be tracking and looking at who your prospects are using today  who they re evaluating as part of the sales process  or whose products they choose if not yours  Remember that your  competitors  don t need to be companies that offer the same product as you they can simply be alternatives that your customers use to solve the same problem   Look at search engines to see who s competing for your customers  attention   Brand leaders  Top trend setting companies  like Airbnb or Uber  can also serve as solid inspiration  These companies are often highlighted in the news or even get surfaced on sites like Crayon Inspire  If you want to get more scientific about looking at top websites  you can start by reviewing Alexa s Top 500 Sites   What makes up that context  The type of data to collect starts but does not end with design  There s a wide range of data that can inform and influence your design work   Related  How to get started with data driven design  Design  The most obvious place to start when pulling together your context is the design itself  Website and product designs you can get a hold of  as well as previous designs  can quickly build up your contextual library  Content  The content included in those designs  as well as the content off site  can tell you a lot about the company s brand and how you can stand out in comparison  Look at website copy  ebooks  videos  social media posts  and any other content you can get  Promotions  Look at what these companies proactively put out  including new promotions  campaigns and offers  and announcements  This can give you insight into what that company sees as most important and compelling  Product  Of course  you ll also want to stay on top of the product s  themselves  including features  pricing  packaging  positioning  and reviews  Reputation  Design can be a major contributor to the communication of the company s brand reputation  so look at the context of reviews  news  awards  and more that make up the reputation of these companies  People  Who the company does business with and how they communicate those relationships can also play an interesting role in your design context  Look at the customers  partners  management team  and employee base to see what the company says about its people and what its people say about the company   Case study  T Mobile uses design to highlight a competitive edge  Design can be a powerful differentiation and branding tool  particularly in a crowded  commodity market  The cell phone market is a great example of such a market  Verizon and AT T have long been the market share leaders  but T Mobile has shot up to the third place spot in recent years  Their low pricing has often been credited with driving this success  but their design has also helped hammer home the brand differentiation   Looking at these homepages  the contrast is pretty obvious  Verizon and AT T highlight the phones themselves on a backdrop of a simple  black and white color scheme   Meanwhile  T Mobile uses bright imagery and highlights their lower price and transparent pricing plans  In fact  the subheading specifically calls out a competitor   Why pay  600 more every year with Verizon    They also note that the pricing includes all taxes and fees  a pain point often noted in their competitors  customer reviews  This customer focus is also reinforced with their use of people imagery across their website   The ultimate result  Better design a design that stands apart from the competition  shows they listen to what the market is saying  and communicates their human brand and their product differentiation   There are many ways context can inform and influence designs  from highlighting a competitive edge  to aligning with customer values  to mirroring a recognizable user experience   How have you leveraged your company s context to drive an effective design  Tell us on Twitter   InVisionApp,"[758 1024 261 523 149

796,training-dataset/product/400.txt,product,What does it mean to design for development This is an excerpt from Designing with your developer in mind  an InVision e course by Kevin Tomasso   Designing for development is about finding the solution that produces the best possible user experience with the least moving parts   Web applications aren t one and done projects  They need to grow  evolve  and change sometimes rather quickly  When making decisions  designers must consider how the design is constructed  A design that looks great to the user but breaks every time a developer needs to make a change isn t a great design it s a pretty interface with an underlying problem   Designing with development in mind is about working as a team  not merely completing a step in a procedure   The end goal is to create a great product that s the sum of the design and development process  A design can improve with the input of a developer  and code can be better written with the help of a designer  Working together and understanding where you both come from will help tremendously in achieving goals and overcoming obstacles   Designing with development in mind is about knowing the end goals and better answering tough decisions through expanded knowledge of the full picture   When you can see the forest through the trees  you can better navigate to a destination  In this case your destination is a great product   What designing with development is not  This isn t an invitation or excuse to yield to every bit of developer criticism or feedback  And it doesn t suggest that their job is more important in any way  Just like how a product can t exist until it s coded  the product has no place in a user s life without a design   The design and experience of a product is what attracts and keeps users  Without a good design  the best sites and apps can only hope to be successful despite their appearance  I m looking at you  Craigslist    The reality is that design usually happens first  So knowing what tools and techniques are going to be used to carry out your design will have a much bigger effect than that of the opposite   Loving it so far  Sign up to get the other chapters free delivered straight to your inbox  It doesn t do the developer much good if they know how to retouch an image by adjusting the levels and curves and using the burn tool in Photoshop  because by the time it gets to them  they simply have to add the finished image to the site   Conversely  if you know the best ways to save that image to reduce the file size and increase performance  your product will improve  You can think about helping them do their job while you do yours  but it usually doesn t work the other way around   You are the architect  It s in everyone s best interest if you know a little bit about how the construction crew does its job   Follow these simple rules to become an awesome designer  This course is meant to help you design with your developers in mind  What s left unsaid throughout this is that your job is first and foremost to design with your users in mind  You know this  you re awesome at this  and you don t need to hear it from me  The goal is to make you better at the bigger picture so that every design decision you make will improve the product one way or the other   The simple checklist to run through when you re confronted with any design decision is as follows   When there s a clear benefit to the user  do it  Don t let a developer talk you out of it if it s absolutely a better user experience   Example  If error messages on your site need to be different colors  have specific wording  and show up inline with their form elements to avoid user abandonment rather than a generic message at the top of the page  make it happen  The extra work in the beginning will be well worth it for the success of your product   Ask how you can help get this done  Use whatever facts and sources you can to explain your position  but don t let the user suffer because it s slightly more challenging in development   Investigate whether there s a way to create a similar effect to benefit the user and the codebase  Many times what you want to accomplish can be done in a similar way that s easier or less messy to code  Seek developers  input  Their logical brain might come up with a better solution than you had originally planned that works for the user and them as well   Example  Maybe the error messages can be categorized and color coded into a reusable scheme  Instead of having a custom message and color for every input like the example above  maybe there are 3 categories of messages  each with their own color  This allows the developers to better organize and reuse code while still communicating clearly to the user   When an argument can be made either way about whether an item  design element  or feature benefits the user  choose the path that makes the code more reusable  consistent  or clean  Can your warning messages use your corporate yellow instead of a more typical orange  Both of these convey the nature of the alert to the user  but using a saved and consistent color value cuts down on complexity and keeps the code leaner   Read the next chapter  Learn to work with developers  not against them  in this free e course by Kevin Tomasso and InVision  Sign up here to get the other chapters of this e course

862,training-dataset/product/1080.txt,product,How to build trust with your design teamBased in Austin  Texas  Handsome is a digital agency with a focus on experience design  innovation  and technology  They ve worked with Nickelodeon  FedEx  Facebook  and Home Depot  to name just a few   We chatted with Brandon Termini  Executive Creative Director  and Anna Krachey  Experience Design Lead  about creating a great team culture  how designers can prepare for the future  and the thing nobody should ever do inside an office   How is your team set up   We believe that amazing results can come from small  dedicated teams of experts  A key word here for us is dedicated  When we engage with clients we build a team comprised  at its core  of a product manager  experience designer  product designer  and technologist   More from Handsome  Improving UX with Pixar s 22 rules of storytelling  These people are dedicated to our client partnering  integrating  and collaborating with the client throughout the process  Depending on the needs of the engagement  we ll assign other specialists to the team such as brand designers  strategists  mobile engineers  etc   This dedicated team model allows the people working on the project to be truly immersed in our client s market  organizational culture  and the problem space  Everyone puts their hands on the problem  everyone speaks with and observes the users  and everyone contributes in ideation  prototyping  and iteration   We don t believe in the assembly line approach we see at other agencies  We don t see the value in large  heavy  hierarchical teams   How can organizations create a great work team culture   Our entire agency and design teams are comprised of individuals who are curious  ambitious  and engaged in learning  We intentionally hire team members who want to individually learn and grow as much as possible and also want to help each other develop and grow skill sets   This has a resounding effect on our office culture and on our design practice as our team members grow  we re constantly pushing and iterating on our practice to be as collaborative  efficient  and current as possible   In order to push through ambiguity in solving complex problems  each team member has to trust one another  be humble to each other and to the process  and truly become immersed in the problem space as a unit   How does your team communicate   Collaboration and communication are central to our culture   During the ideation phase of design we ll time block sketch sessions in order to rapidly ideate  In between time blocks  we ll hang our ideas on the walls  walk around  look  ask questions  and give feedback  Generally  this is a time when we talk about the benefits and drawbacks of a particular design  give encouragement  and get excited about one another s ideas about how this thing might take shape   This open style of communication allows us to build rapport and trust among designers and in our design teams   A key part of making collaboration successful is our ability to be flexible enough to know when we need to come together as a team  and when it s time to be heads down and get stuff done autonomously   How do you hand off designs to the engineering team   We believe that there should never be a handoff  but a continual team effort to work towards a solution   So  we involve technology early on in the process  Our technologists collaborate closely with designers to help push products and experiences creatively forward  We try to strike the right balance of next level ideas with feasible near term solutions   Leveraging tools like InVision has definitely helped us in the past to quickly get feedback on proposed solutions throughout the design process   How do you hire new people  What catches your eye when you re looking at someone s portfolio  What makes you immediately move onto the next applicant   We re refining our hiring process and currently it s different for every role  Because rigor in research is such a critical part of our process  when we re hiring UX designers we ll often have candidates create discussion guides for an assigned research topic  generally one that we already know well  internally  and then interview a participant of our choice  not a designer   during the interview  It gives us a glimpse into their ability to wrap their minds around a problem  interface with participants  gather data and to synthesize on the fly   We debrief with the candidate to get a sense of their openness to critique  dialogue  and growth  It s been really successful in helping us to get to understand aspects of candidates quickly and their aptitude and interest for our culture and process   Pass on a candidate  Inability to tell the story of their work and lack of rigor behind design decisions   For hiring visual designers  we start by culling candidates who show aptitude for creating design with a refined aesthetic  who are experimenting with motion design  and who want to make experiences that are delightful to use  and not just look at  From there  it s all about how they talk about their work  their ambition for growth  and how we think they d fit into our collaborative  close knit culture   What can teams do to build trust with each other   Aside from having a design process that encourages exploration and open dialog  we think the trust among team members stems from the culture we ve fostered here  We ve focused on creating a culture of collaboration  mentorship  and autonomy   Trust is instilled when teams have a shared understanding of the challenges at hand and shared ownership in a holistic vision  We build trust as a team when we re grappling with ambiguity  We take pride in our ability to navigate through the unknown  making decisions that build toward successful experiences   Where do you see the design industry headed  and how can designers prepare for it   At Handsome  we believe the future of the design industry is one where delightful and thoughtful customer experiences will become a standard  As tools become more powerful and easy to use and the boundaries of design continue to blur  clients will exceedingly expect more output and at a faster rate  In this world  designers will be expected to be even more multi faceted in order to survive  we will be forced to think more strategically about business problems and design holistic brand experiences that solve for them   Our advice to designers is never be satisfied with your knowledge base  Always seek out savvy ways to get better at your craft and to add to the tools available in your proverbial toolbelt   How does InVision save you time   InVision is a critical part of our design process  We use it to quickly create prototypes that we can test with our users  The comment feature allows to document our feedback contextual as well as to discuss internally   Using InVision s transition features and GIF support also have proven invaluable with our ability to present prototypes that feel alive before we ve put in the time for motion design   What s your best advice for young designers   Always be ready to articulate the  why  behind a design decision  both to your teammates and also to the stakeholder s   Know your users before you dive into creating anything for them  Don t make bullshit personas  The user is not like you  Actively listen and reflect  Both with colleagues and with clients   Synthesize on the fly  Eat food that smells bad OUTSIDE of the office  Make things fast  Set a timer  Get your ideas out and down  Externalize  Get feedback  Once you ve got a direction  then you can go back and solidify details  That applies to sketching and to strategy docs  etc   Always validate your assumptions  Never stop learning  Design is always evolving and you should be  too   Read more interviews with top designers,"[862 8 189 1024 235 1251 523 879 1173 870 1308]"
870,training-dataset/business/497.txt,business,The agile design team maturity scaleDesign is historically a waterfall process  The change to an agile workflow is usually driven by the engineering team  or by the demands of the organization to deliver faster in the face of market disruption  Whatever the reason for the switch  in my experience the journey to adapt to an agile practice appears to follow the same pattern   This journey is similar whether the design team is an in house product team  a digital agency  or a consultancy there are just differences in how difficult it is for the team to move along the journey or where they start  I also believe that the recent trend of designers moving from agencies to in house positions is connected to the opportunity to move along this journey  and the impact they can have on the products they create   Related  How to adapt design for agile workflows  From conversations with other designers and design leaders  or those who have heard me talk on the subject or read one of my previous articles  it has become clear that every team or organization is on the same journey  They all recognize where they are on the journey  and the steps they ve been through  There s also great interest in knowing where other teams are on the journey  as well as identifying the right steps to move forward   I ve created the agile design team maturity scale to chart your team s progress and to benchmark it against others  It also serves as a target to aim for in developing your practice   The agile design team maturity scale  The scale is a simple 10 step journey that moves through 3 distinct stages  starting at throwing grenades  moving to feeding the beast  and eventually getting to design facilitation  No 2 teams are exactly alike  so the scale allows for room between the 3 main stages to acknowledge those in between steps   When a team begins to adapt to an agile workflow  they can be at any point on the scale  This depends on how they worked and how they were structured before the change  For example  a large organization that operates a design department will most likely find themselves right at the throwing grenades stage  On the other hand  a startup building a brand new design team may find it possible to jump right in at design facilitation on the scale   Different teams move at different speeds along the scale  As you ll find out below  most teams really slow down when they hit the feeding the beast stage   It s also possible for a team to move backwards on the scale for various reasons  Those reasons could include things like  organization changes  changes in the way the engineering team operates  or simply if a movement on the scale doesn t work for the team  Moving backwards isn t a bad thing  Teams have to figure out the most effective way to work   The scale isn t intended to measure how effective a team is it s intended to highlight a common journey experienced across the industry  The effectiveness of a team depends on how the team is measured  As you ll see below  the method used to measure a team is the main indicator of movement on the scale  The scale is best used to describe where your team is at and where you want to get to   Throwing grenades  This stage is where most design teams start from when adapting to an agile practice  It comes from the core design process of briefing  creating  collecting feedback  and then delivering a finished design  This is typically how an agency might operate  It s named after the way a finished design is handed over to an engineering team in the pre agile siloed world  affectionately known as throwing a grenade over the wall   In this stage  the design team operates as a single unit  They ll sit together  often in a different room or even building from the engineers  They will most likely refer to their office as a studio   The team takes orders from the business or client in the form of a brief or a set of requirements  They will transform this brief into a beautiful design  gathering feedback from the business along the way  The business will sign it off  then the design team will prepare a specification document to hand over to the engineering team  They will then move onto the next project   An extreme example I ve experienced has each specialty of design working as an individual silo  each handing over to the next silo as part of the delivery process  Solution architects hand over to interaction designers  who hand over to visual design  before finally handing over to engineering  Each person is throwing the grenade over the wall  hoping someone catches it   The important thing to point out is that the team is measured by their ability to provide a solution for the business  then to deliver it to engineering or the next team in line   Related  The questions you need to ask developers before you start designing  Also   Projects are planned in a waterfall of activities  each handing over a deliverable to the next  The engineering team is not consulted during the design phase  and the design team is not present during the build phase to assist with any compromises  Change is difficult to accommodate  There is a big disconnect between the designer and the product that ends up in the customer s hands  While the engineering team may operate in an agile way  the design team may not no matter how many buzzwords like  sprint  are used  All this makes throwing grenades sound like a bad way to work  However  designers feel safe in this environment  They re protected from the constraints of delivery and given the creative freedom to properly explore solutions  The results can often be amazing with really creative ideas and beautiful designs  The team will usually seek recognition through industry awards   Feeding the beast  This stage is perhaps the most important of the 3  This is the stage that most agile design teams appear to be in or near  and it s also where most teams start to struggle  Progress from here is often really slow and requires significant change  Feeding the beast is named after how this stage feels for the designers  working super quick to ensure the engineering team has everything they need to keep going   The designers have broken from their team unit  They re distributed amongst the agile delivery teams  Typically there will be 1 designer for as many as 8 developers  They will also work closely with the product owner for that team  The designer will sit with their teams and focus on delivering the designs needed for their team to build   The designer on the team will work 1 2 sprints ahead of the rest of their team  They will take epics from the backlog  They will do the research and prepare the designs  In some cases  they will even write the user stories for the engineers  in collaboration with the product owner and the engineers  Then they will hand it over just in time for the engineers to build  They may even get involved with signing stories off once they re ready to be shipped   In this phase  the designer  not design team  is measured by their ability to deliver everything that the engineers need  They re also measured alongside the engineers by things like velocity or cycle time  This adds extra pressure on the designer to keep the engineers busy   Also   The designer will find it difficult to collaborate with the engineers who are focused on the current sprint s delivery goal  Things get built before they are ready simply because the designer simply runs out of time  The process is incremental not iterative as the designer  and engineers  will move from one story to the next  Change is accepted as part of the process  but it means the designer has to throw away a lot of work  The team will debate at some point whether to include design in estimates  It takes a strong leader to bring the distributed designers together as a team  When feeding the beast works well  it works really well and everything just flows  But when it doesn t  the designer can often feel overwhelmed by the pressure and the quality of design can be affected greatly  The worst example I ve seen is when overwhelmed designers got too far behind the engineers  Features were completely built by the engineering team without input from designers  The designers were then asked to  make it pretty  just before the feature was shipped to the customer   From my experience  most teams are in this stage  Most of them also appear stuck  I think this is because to advance beyond feeding the beast  a team must change the way they re measured  For most teams  it s really hard to see past design as a deliverables role  For the others  the barrier comes from the business and the way strategic decisions are made   Moving beyond feeding the beast requires a culture shift in the organization  Allowing an experimental approach to creating products and emergent strategy to guide decisions on what to build  The design team must also accept a change in role and welcome design facilitation   Design facilitation  This stage for most agile design teams is the dream  They read about it in books such as Lean UX by Jeff Gothelf and Sprint by the Google Ventures team  However  the reality of getting there is hard  I ve named this stage after how I see the role of the designer evolve when teams reach design facilitation   The designers are still embedded in small cross functional teams  but the roles in these teams are less clear  Job titles are left outside the door  Teams are empowered to experiment using techniques like the Design Sprint and Hypothesis Driven Development  They re given direction by the business in the form of target for a Key Performance Indicators  KPIs   They ll discover the right feature to build  then iterate over and over again to reach the target   The designer on the team works right alongside the engineers  not ahead  as they did in feeding the beast  Rather than being created by the designer  the design evolves through the input of the whole team and the data collected from the customer  Therefore  the role of the designer has shifted  They are now the facilitator of the design  They lead the conversations and steer the team towards the results needed to achieve the team s goal   In this dream stage  the designer is measured and held accountable with their cross functional team for the outcome observed rather than the deliverables or the act of shipping   Also   Research is a core activity that the whole cross functional team gets involved in and cares about  Conversations and sketches replace most of the old design deliverables  Designers will seek feedback from the rest of the design team but have the autonomy to make their own decisions  there are no gatekeepers  Cross functional teams are self organizing  often creating their own  best of  process  Designer will also regularly design directly in code  The team will develop a design system that enables them to iterate on the product at a much faster rate  while still being consistent and high quality  Examples of design facilitation are few and far between  Startups appear to be the most likely organizations to have a team that operates like this  It s much harder for larger organizations to reach this stage  as it requires a significant and difficult culture change first  While some agencies are moving towards this stage  for most it is difficult to reach as it requires a shift in their business model  A rethink in the way they invoice for the work they do   Throwing grenades  feeding the beast  or design facilitation  Which one   Deciding where your team lives on this scale is easy deciding where you want to be and getting there is tough  Each team has to find the best place the stage that offers the most efficiency and the best morale for the team that in turn leads to the best end product   The scale is just as much about the individual designers on the team as it is the team itself  The team can pick their point on the scale  But that s related to the average of where the individuals in the team are on the scale themselves  There can be quite a difference between between designers on the same team  Also  the engineering teams and product owners have an impact  along with the culture of the organization   Where does your team live on the scale  Let me know if you find it useful and if it helps move your team to a more productive and rewarding state   This was originally published in UX Magazine,"[870 1024 1251 701 8 261 862 879 1308 1173 523]"

guide the software industry forward  Aarron joined me on the podcast to chat about the why your design team needs soft skills  the role of design values and the importance of designing for empathy and emotion  If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the interview  but if you re short on time  here are five key takeaways  Academia and field experience both play a role in design education  Those who know the tools of the trade  but can also think deeply about the meaning of the product and the strategy are in a strong position for leadership  When it comes to making design hires  hone on a candidate s soft skills  How do they communicate  Are they adaptable  Have they found creative solutions in the past  Cross functional teams can be an asset  but you can t leave designers on an island where  for example  engineers outnumber them 6 1  Strong design values and regular feedback from fellow designers are critical culture components  especially in this structure  Designers at startups often optimize for speed early in the design process  when they should be doing so toward end  If you don t slow down to truly understand your users  problems  there won t be time for success  A great product accounts for a buyer s emotional decisions  When several products get the job done  which one feels the best in doing it  Adam Risman  Aarron  welcome to the show  Most of our listeners will know you through the UX work and incredible team you built at MailChimp  But before we get to that  I want to ask about your unique new role at InVision  What does that entail and why were you so excited about the opportunity  Aarron Walter  VP of Design Education is a pretty unique thing for our company and the software industry  but because we make software for designers  we want to see design succeed throughout our industry  We definitely see a big trend happening right now where our tools are starting to change the way that we design  which helps our medium become a lot more sophisticated  and we see consumers becoming a lot more sophisticated in how they use software  Everybody s got a phone  an iPad  a laptop   we re connected all the time  It used to be that we would buy these books like iOS for Dummies or Word for Dummies because we were dummies  we weren t very sophisticated with software  But now software is in every aspect of our life  We know what a good experience is and what a bad experience is  We vote with our home screens on what we re going to use  We see big companies like IBM  which is this Fortune 10 company with tens of thousands of employees around the world  hiring something like 2 000 designers  They re investing heavily in design  We see Google  which is a company that s really prided itself on its engineering prowess  transforming into a design focused company  We see this happening in Salesforce and many other companies where design is becoming a high priority  because consumers know what a good experience is  and that s what we re selling now  It s not a feature matrix  it s the experience  Our tools and the environment for the software  it s really changing the way we work  So why is design education important  At InVision we re not just selling the platform where people design and collaborate on design  but we re also helping designers and all the teams that they collaborate with  from executives  engineers and product managers to lawyers and support teams  All those people come together around design  We want to see design elevate across our industry and that s a big part of what my team is doing  We re helping companies learn how to do design better  The value of soft skills Adam  The role sounds like a mix between two previous careers of yours  your time leading the team at MailChimp  and the time you spent in academia as a Design Professor prior to that  There s a bit of a debate in the design industry around certification and degrees  Your friend Jared Spool  who just launched Center Centre earlier this year  has been really vocal about balancing field experience with academic learning  Why are we seeing this imbalance  Has academia simply been slow to catch up to technology  Aarron  There s always going to be a bit of imbalance with academia because it s a medium that is slow to change  and that s one of its virtues  From where we stand in technology and design  we change fast  and we see that as our virtue  Depending on where you stand  each virtue can become a vice  but academia  it just can t keep up with how fast technology is changing and that s okay  It s really good at delivering this connected  liberal arts education where students get perspective on a lot of different domains and different subjects  That s an important part of feeding creativity   that creativity is about connecting the disconnected  finding new ideas by exploring different territory  Creativity  is about connecting the disconnected  Academia is still very important and very relevant  It s important to study things like philosophy  religion  mathematics  biology and art  They feel unrelated to what we re doing  but over the years I ve hired so many people that have those sorts of backgrounds  They didn t necessarily have a technology background or a even a design background  but they were able to level up those skills to augment a really solid foundation in liberal arts  I ve also hired some people that were college dropouts  They made it about a year and said   You know what  This isn t for me  I ve got to be making things with my hands   They went out  got a job in an agency  worked with a bunch of clients  worked really hard and learned on the job  That s okay too  It s a different way of coming to an understanding of what you re doing  but I don t think it s wrong  One isn t better than the other  Jared is essentially suggesting a balance  If you re entirely academic  but you have not actually practiced or applied those ivory tower ideas  if you haven t applied those to something practical  then is that very useful  Conversely  if you only know the tools of the trade  can you think very deeply about the meaning of the product and the strategy  Can you think very high level  Maybe not  A balance between those two puts you in a really strong position to be a leader in design and technology  versus just a technician  Adam  You mentioned hiring  something you did quite a bit of at MailChimp as you scaled that team  At early stage start ups where you re hiring the first few designers people skills and chemistry are so important  What are the qualities beyond the resume page that you would look for in designers  Aarron  I wrote about a post about this a while back   Hire People Not Skills   The typical way we do hiring in so many different businesses is we list out the skills you need to be able to do the job  but stop for a minute and think of if you ve fired a person or you ve known people in your organization that have been fired  Was it because they re HTML wasn t good or their designs weren t up to par  Maybe  but most of the time it s the soft skills that get people booted  When we re hiring we need to focus on the soft skills  How well does someone communicate  How do they collaborate with other people  Are they adaptable  or do they have to have things just right to feel like they can do good work  We can investigate these soft skills by basically making time with people to learn more about who they are as a person  Learn about what their interests are  if they ve got side projects that are interesting  and how they re jumping into these side projects and solving problems  There s some folks I ve interviewed who are working on a side project not because anyone asked it of them  and they were doing it nights and weekends  This showed a person with passion  They didn t have the right things to be able to build what they wanted  They were figuring out solutions in a creative way  and that stuff is really compelling to me  I would hire off of that versus a resume any day  A lot of times I would spend an entire day with a person  getting them in front of lots of different people  making time for them to hang out over coffee or lunch  because it s really hard to fake your way through a day s worth of conversations  You can fake your way through a 30 minute or one hour interview and really put your best foot forward  Time is definitely an important part of the hiring process  The positives and problems with cross functional teams Adam  We re seeing a lot of companies that  as they begin to scale  are embedding designers alongside engineers and product managers on actual product teams  How can designers in these settings avoid the feeling of isolation and champion smaller details to those may overlook or undervalue them  Those soft skills really come into play there   Aarron  There are definitely some challenges with cross functional teams  but they re good on so many levels that help us to better understand our colleagues and heir domain better  which creates empathy and respect  I m a big believer that organizational design heavily influences product design  If you ve got the wrong organizational design for the time  the stage your company is in  it s really hard to make your best work  But there are situations where designers are solo in a cross functional team  where they re outnumbered by engineers by six to one  It s going to be a tall order to convince anyone  Even if you re a great communicator and you re humble and collaborative  it puts you at a great disadvantage  Feedback is the lifeblood of a healthy design team  It s better if we can design those situations and structure our teams so designers are never on an island  Either they have at least one other designer working with them on that project or if resources are thin  a designer who might be on a different team but works with you like eight hours a week  Because if you re working as a designer on a problem  you can get stuck  Then you end up spinning your wheels because you re not getting feedback  and feedback is the lifeblood of a healthy design team and design practice  Designers who are on their own  they feel like their careers stagnate and they re not growing  Ask any designer what they want in their dream job  They don t say   I want  50 000 more per year   or   I want better health care   They say   I want a place where I can learn and grow   If you re the only designer on a team  you re just not going to get that  You re not going to grow and the company is going to have a churn problem   turnover where people are going to leave looking for a more healthy situation  So not putting designers on an island is important  I think a designer should see  a cross functional team  as an opportunity to learn from other folks  But have a strong set of values that guide design so it doesn t feel like   okay  we re changing the color of this button again  Why is this meaningful   Because designers can get caught noodling  This is another problem  If you re left to your own devices for too long  you lose track of what s really meaningful  Having design values  we see this in a number of companies  They re coming up with design systems that are not just about design patterns and what do buttons and forms look like  but also  why did we do this  We ll use IBM as an example  They ve got a design system that draws upon the history of the company and the brand  The way that they animate relates to the machines from the  60s and the  70s  There s this rich history that s embedded in the design concepts they re producing  and that can help a designer greatly  They can stop talking just about style and start talking about the values   IBM s design principles Engineers have certain values  very quantitative values of like how many bugs were produced in this last release  or what s the time to ship  These are not necessarily the values that should guide design  Design is qualitative  so designers need values to guide them  Adam  As a company grows  there are new business hurdles to navigate and more decision makers coming into the fold  As someone who s ridden that growth curve before at MailChimp  what can early stage design leaders be doing to help prepare for those challenges  Aarron  It s about recognizing where you are and how things will change  When you re in that early stage  you will tend to hire for a diverse set of skills  Someone that could do a lot of things  but they re not necessarily a specialist  because you don t have very many people on staff and have to get all these things done  Versatility is advantageous early on  As you grow  those versatile people start to specialize and find specific pockets where they can contribute to the company or the team  Then hiring shifts  You need to hire more specialists  so knowing early on that you re going to have your values for hiring and that how you ll organize the team will change  that s important  Recognizing that your current team structure should work for now  but doesn t have to work for perpetuity  In fact  it should change  Early on it might be best to have design separate from engineering  but as you grow maybe it needs to be more decentralized  It s about recognizing the size of the company  where the product is  and how mature the product is  All of these things they need to be considered along the way   The need for empathy in design Adam  You re very passionate about the idea of designing for empathy  a concept that it s important for companies at all stages   yet is difficult to execute for different reasons at different stages  Early on you can get caught up in the rush of shipping as quickly as possible  As you reach scale and grow  designers can become more insulated  How do you advise that designers break out of their bubble and experience the stress of real users at an early stage  And what s the key to maintaining that empathetic culture at scale  Aarron  It s a matter of stating clearly that this is a value to us  Recognizing that if we optimize for speed at the beginning of a product  we spend a lot of time and resources making the thing  we ship it and the first impression with customers is negative because we didn t stop and research the market   actually talk to our potential customers and basically consider the problem from all angles   we lose that first impression opportunity  Maybe people will come back  Will people download a mobile app again  Probably not  If it wasn t right out of the gate  they re not coming back to you  If you don t have time to talk to your customers  you don t have time for success  We often optimize for speed in the wrong place  We need to take some time up front to really understand the problem  Understand the customers  understand the market  design and build accordingly  How do we break out of this pattern of saying   We don t have time for research   Look  if you don t have time to talk to your customers  you don t have time for success  If you don t know your customers  there s no way you can actually solve the problem  That s got to come from the top  Leaders have to say   This is important for us  and we re going to invest in this   In terms of designing for empathy and human connection  this is something that s very familiar in architecture  industrial design  graphic design  all these disciplines that have been around for a long time  They recognize that they re designing not just to be functional  but to be pleasing and attractive and meaningful  We have hundreds of years of experience with these mediums where we see this value  Look at automotive design for example  a Honda HR V  It s a very practical  simple car  It s economic  It gets good gas mileage  you can do a lot with it  It s  19 000  A Lexus RX is  64 000  It s four times as much money as a Honda HR V  but it basically does the same thing  Why do we spend four times as much money  We feel this sense of status and luxury   A Lexus RX 350 provides a sense of status and luxury that s reflected in the price  There are all sorts of emotional reasons why we would make that purchase decision  We know this from other disciplines  In software  we re not dealing with material goods  but we are dealing with the experience  Creating a user experience that s not just about I got my work done  but did that feel good to get my work done  Do I want to go back here  Do I want to tell friends about this  All of these things are really powerful if we stop and carefully consider connecting with emotion  not just the quantitative things  Adam  When you talk about how it s crazy not to prioritize this stuff early  is part of the problem this fail fast mantra that s often cited in the software industry  Aarron  I m not a huge fan of that idea  The surest way to fail fast is to not talk to your customers or investigate the market or put yourself in their shoes  The idea is really just a phrase that s misinterpreted  It s about learning fast  It s about making things and trying things without the fear of doing it wrong  That is good to a certain degree  but it can lead us to optimize in the wrong place  where we get speed early on  Really we need speed at the end  We need to design and build faster  but take more time to solve the problem  A friend of mine  Laura Martini  summed this up in a simple quote  She said   You win a race at the finish line  not at the starting blocks  Fail fast to me is often interpreted in the Valley as being fast out of the gate  which is dangerous  Designing for emotion Adam  Speaking of empathy  that s a big component of a book that you put out about five years ago  Designing for Emotion  If you were to go back today and say  release a second edition  what needs to be said or covered that wasn t then  What would you accentuate more,"[879 523 1024 8 1251 261 556 1173 1290 862 189]"

Black History Month  Be sure to read what s been posted so far  and visit 28blacks com every day this month for new interviews   Tiffany Middleton is a Digital Media Designer at ESPN  where she most recently worked on a Super Bowl piece for their Snapchat Discover edition that compared the 2 teams  quarterback stats from the season  Below  hear what Tiffany had to say about dealing with rejection  her experience as a person of color in the design industry  and how design can be more accommodating   How did you get into design   I grew up in a small town in Alabama  and design was an unknown entity for me  Oddly  I always found myself admiring cover art and layouts in the magazine section of the local grocery stores  As faith would have it  the term  graphic design  was introduced to me by an article in Teen Vogue   Years later  I graduated from Auburn University with a degree in graphic design  Which would take me from the field of Jordan Hare Stadium to a little trading card company outside of Dallas  and finally to Bristol  Connecticut home of ESPN   I m from Childersburg  Alabama  a small town where sports are the only extracurricular activities for kids in the neighborhood  When people ask where I m from  I have to ask them if they know the basketball player Gerald Wallace  because he s our town s claim to fame   I spent most of my childhood playing basketball  which is where my love of sports came from  I volunteered to design our class shirts and produced my senior class video   Tell us about your design work   Over the years  I ve produced a wide variety of work social content  some recruiting material targeted towards high school teenagers  and I even had the opportunity to work on printed products for a professional trading card company   Working on social platforms is my favorite because it can communicate your message to millions of people with a click of a button   Related  An open letter to up and coming women in digital design  Is there anything that you re currently doing that people should know about   My proudest accomplishment isn t any design that I ve executed  but my social handle and blog  Trenches   I started it a few years back to provide an online source for designers and creatives interested in the sports industry  I d see beautiful designs on social media and in person and wonder who was responsible  Trenches provides a place for those designers to come out of hiding from their cubicles and connect with others in the industry  I connected with my current creative director after he followed the account on Twitter  It s connected me with designers from Nike  NBA  NFL  The New York Times  Snapchat  Wired  and much more  It s my claim to fame   Everyone goes through ups and downs in their career  What are some issues you wrestle with   Getting rejected is by far the biggest struggle of my career  I ve applied for dozens of jobs that I didn t get  and that made me doubt myself as a designer   Design can be extremely subjective  so I had to learn just because one person dislikes your work  that doesn t make it bad  I can say that it also motivated me to improve and expand my skill set continually  I make it a point to learn new techniques and new programs as often as possible   What are you doing that s sets you apart from you peers   My favorite quote is  hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard   which is what I feel like sets me apart from my peers  I work twice as hard as the next designer  I do everything possible to put myself ahead of the game  Even if that means staying at work late to perfect a design after everyone has gone home   What has your experience been as a person of color in the design industry   I ve always been the only African American when it has come to my design classes or jobs  It can be isolating  but for the most part  I ve had the opportunity to work with some great people who make me feel included   Personally  it never hurts seeing someone who looks and speaks like you  I d love to have more women and people of color in the industry   How can design be more accommodating to underrepresented populations   There s a lack of knowledge about the importance of design  It can be more accommodating to underrepresented populations just by allowing them to be exposed to it  I m a firm believer of knowledge being power  One cannot know what they cannot see   What are you working on right now  either for work or for yourself   I m currently working on a Super Bowl piece for ESPN s Snapchat Discover edition that compares the teams  quarterbacks   Where do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years  Do you think you ll stay in design   I love being a designer in the trenches  but in the future  I d like to take the role of a design influencer  creative director  or producer  Sometimes you lose creative control working under creative and art directors   Also  I ve always had the dream of working at Nike  so if I could end up there in the next 10 years  my life would be complete   What advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds who are in design or hoping to get into it   It s not always about what you know  but who you know  The design world can be minuscule and inclusive  Making connections with people through social media and networking events can help you get your foot in the door   You may produce great work  but if no one knows your face or brand  it can be hard to break into the industry  Use social media as a tool to get eyes on your work  Don t be afraid to ask for feedback on your portfolio  It may be surprising  but my current and past creative directors use social media when they re looking to hire or commission designs   Don t forget to visit 28 Days of Black Designers every day this month to read a new interview with an inspiring black designer  You can also follow Tim Hykes on Twitter to get updates on the project,"[927 523 8 1024 879 261 1277 1308 1251 1173

942,training-dataset/product/785.txt,product,Getting into Design Sprints43 Flares 43 Flares    I recently had the pleasure of taking part in an Ask Me Anything  AMA  discussion in the Mind the Product Slack community  where we talked about Design Sprints  how I take my coffee  a cortado   and my favorite board game  Chutes  N Ladders    I ve pulled together the Design Sprints bit of the conversation  as I imagine that will be the most interesting to the most people  and I hope you find some of it useful   Let s Start With What Design Sprints Actually are  It s design while wearing running shoes and a track suit   But seriously  a Design Sprint is a time boxed problem solving format that is part design process  part scientific method and part agile mindset  That s a lot of buzzwords  I know  So let me break that down   It s usually five days  one phase day  though I ve seen and done many iterations  Understand   dig into the problem  its context  and your assumptions around it Diverge   generate solutions for the problem Converge   Select which solutions to prototype and test Prototype   Build the one or two solution concepts to test Test   Get the prototype in front of those who will use buy interact to observe them and gauge their feedback  Why and when would you use a Design Sprint  And where would you not use them   Don t use it to do something simple  like  Where should we add this form   That likely doesn t need a Design Sprint  It s better for when you have a big problem to solve and you don t have lots of answers  Or there are a lot of assumptions and the team s unsure of which direction to go   They re great when exploring new product areas or product redesigns   On Understanding Design Sprints  What would be the key distinctions between Design Sprints and Lean UX   So many similarities  Sometimes I think they re different sides of the same coin  Both are very experimental in nature  hence the science   design overlap   Design Sprints   I think of it as a time boxed one week focused activity    I think of it as a time boxed one week focused activity Lean UX  approaches could take days or even months depending on what the experiment requires  not quite as structured  for activities  either   Do you encounter objections in taking engineers away from productive work for five days in order to deliver  just one day of code    All the time  The framework encourages  almost by force  a collaborative decision process  This helps the team come to an agreement during the sprint   My colleague Jill Starret always says   If your job can survive a week s vacation  it ll thrive after a week s Design Sprint  Are there any technical prerequisites to having an effective Design Sprint and prototypes to test   Some ideas and prototypes may require live data to test effectively   what we ve done in those situation is mock it up  For one sprint  we knew who the test participants were and we mocked up six different prototypes with data appropriate to them in order to reduce distraction and increase relevance  Some of the newer prototyping tools allow for these type of data intensive prototypes   Remember   You re not building to build  you re building to answer  The prototype is thrown away after a sprint 99  of the time   Do you find that the solution that comes out of a Design Sprint is a visiontype  or have you figured out a way to make it a narrow enough scope to complete in a single epic   That all depends on how you define and narrow the problem on the first day  Sometimes the problem is clear and the range varies greatly  But this would be   should be identified on the first day  and maybe by the second you ll start to gauge how the solutions you re generating can be implemented  That ll also help day three conversations when you select the concepts to build and test   Could you recommend five prototyping tools to help make the sprint flow smoothly   In no particular order   Sketch   InVision or Adobe XD  similar IMHO   HTML CSS  JS if you can code it up quick  Paper prototyping  Axure  Keynote  The GV Design Sprints put the prototype in front of five users  Is five enough    Five on Friday  is a great alliteration   Nielson says so  I usually book seven to nine to allow for no shows   On Pitching Design Sprints  What s the most successful Design Sprint you ve been a part of   That depends on your definition of success  I did one with a large pharma company  18 people in the room   and when we asked how long it would have taken them to get where we ended up without a Design Sprint their response was  years    As someone that works with clients  do you often come up against them being uncomfortable with ambiguity  And how do you help them understand that uncertainty about the final result is okay   All the time  You have to manage expectations up front in the sales process  even if just  selling  internally   Many people conflate output and outcome  and it s always wise to separate the two  While you do create a prototype  the Design Sprint really gets you answers and clarity  Yes  they are intangible  though often far more valuable   On Facilitation  Who does Freshly Tilled Soil bring to the table when doing a Design Sprint for a client   We bring a strategist  who s the facilitator  and a designer  at a minimum  For some bigger sprints we ve brought a second designer and sometimes a project manager   The project manager helps photograph and codify all the activities into a Google Spreadsheet  yes  they transcribe all the Post It notes  etc   super helpful post sprint    a good project manager does wonders   What advice do you have on an adequate amount of prep work before starting a Design Sprint   I m glad you realize the need for prep work  Showing up on day one and saying  Let s do this  is not very wise  Having general direction  team  materials and space are important  Inputs might be UX research  stakeholder interviews  market data  etc   Have you ever started a Design Sprint and  while running it  realized that it might be not helpful at all  How did you proceed   Oh hell yes   Just stop  and realize it s not the right tool for the job  We did this one where the solution was fairly baked and  two days in  the executive came in and asked what the team was doing since the problem was effectively solved   it just hadn t been implemented in the project   The hard part is realizing it   Which teams do you involved in prototyping  Is it solely down to a UX team  or do you involve other teams that may have feedback as well   A cross functional team is best  It s always helpful to have a designer involved from the beginning of the sprint so they can be well informed and build the prototype quickly  However we have brought in designers just for the third day sketching sessions so they aren t completely blind  That s worked OK  but not quite as well as when they have the full context   When in the converging phase  I m finding that there can still be a lot people sticking to their original ideas   are there any techniques you could recommend for helping the team be more open to exploring together   This is where the approach of identifying the critical assumptions  on day one  for the sprint help  This is also where we differ from the GV approach  Your assumptions become a guide for selecting which ideas to move forward  You wind up removing some of that  sticking to ideas  due to these previously identified assumptions   If someone wants to become a great Sprint facilitator  what skills or attributes do they need to cultivate   Just being a good designer  product manager or dev doesn t make you a good sprint facilitator  You need to learn how to facilitate a group  which is a whole other skillset of listening  guiding  and learning how to lower  or admit  your bias  As a facilitator  you need to listen not to just what s being said  but also what s not being said and by whom   pay attention to body language   For those reading  Dan Brown s book   Designing Together   is highly recommended if you re learning about being an effective contributor  And Michael Wilkinson s Secrets of Facilitation is probably my favorite on facilitation  Other than that   Being able to gauge a group   so  listening with your eyes  is important   Commanding attention not demanding attention   Let the team bungee jump  they can fall  but don t let  em hit the ground   How do you collect your Friday testers  and how many days in advance   This is always a challenge with any team I ve worked with  While sometimes it s difficult to arrange ahead of day one  it s sometimes possible  I m wary of going straight to Craigslist or similar open forums even with a solid screener  as some people participate only for the money  70  of my experience with Design Sprints is B2B  so most often the sponsor client can make arrangements ahead of  or during  the sprint  Usually by day three we ve locked down the majority of test interviews and Thursday is confirmation and finalizing   If you need prospects  call the sales team  if there is one  and get them to give you 10 prospects  If you need current customers  get marketing to surrender a similar set of 10 customers that fit the persona you seek to test with   A colleague recently went to the Boston Public Library and did guerrilla testing and it did not go so well  so I d use caution with that kind of random test approach   I ve seen an attitude of boxing the  innovation  into the Design Sprint  and then considering it over afterwards while the  real work  continues  Are there ways to fix that   Yeah   I ve experienced that also  Before you even start the sprint  you need to think about what happens next  And then  during the sprint debrief  you can determine next steps  There are typically three outcomes   You got answers and everything was validated Nothing worked  It kind of worked    this is most common  You need to determine how to address this during the day five retro and debrief  Or yes  it will just die on the vine   Any recommendations about running sprints with the same groups over and over again  How do you keep your team from burning out on the process   That ll actually help you in the long run  as your team will have experience and you won t have to explain each part of the process over and over  That said  you could look for ways to slightly change exercises  For example   change Goals and Anti Goals to Hopes and Fears  While I ve run over 100 sprints myself  I ve rarely seen two run the same way   Ask Me Anything   I had a great time discussing Design Sprints and chatting with product people  If you want  you can always find me on twitter to ask me questions  and I ll answer as best I can in 140 characters,"[942 971 1012 1250 665 948 1400 399 1098 523 566]"
948,training-dataset/product/1368.txt,product,How to pick the most important challenges for your design sprintIn our last discussion  we talked about the  1 design sprint question we hear  What happens after a design sprint   Today we ll tackle question  2  What should we do before our design sprint to ensure we choose the best challenge   It typically takes a lot of educating and arm twisting to convince others on the team to approve a design sprint  So naturally  once you have that blessing  you want to get it right   Assuming you ve set proper expectations around what a design sprint is  what it isn t  and what your team should hope to expect  the focus of this article will offer some recommended pre sprint exercises to help ensure you re thinking about the right types of challenges for your sprint   These exercises are some of many we ve discovered and experimented with  We ultimately adopted them over several months of implementing design sprints into our design thinking practices   We ve found that they not only set us up for the right design sprint challenge  but they offer critical answers design sprints need in order to run successfully   The exercises are centered around 2 groups you need to consider before initiating your design sprints   Your company Your customers  Company priorities  Think about the dissonance a term like design sprint has to your Global Director of Business Development  SVP of Client Success  and CFO  They have their own universe to worry about  Why should they care about a design anything  let alone being locked up in a room with you for 5 days   Their concern is that they don t see the business value in something coined design sprint  And rightfully so   If it becomes the sole discretion of the sprint team to select your sprint challenges based on product roadmaps  technology team bandwidth  and customer analytics how could a sprint align well with business priorities  How could it align with their priorities   Therefore  your first mission way before you pick a date for your design sprint and book the fancy new conference room with floor to ceiling Idea Paint walls is to spend time focusing on problems the business is passionate about solving   It s noble to think customer first  But if your customer asks you to start selling potatoes while your company ethos is centered around healthcare consulting  potato distribution will not be a viable design sprint challenge   In order to gather challenges the business is likely to get behind  we tend to do some combination of the following exercises   Default future   To answer the question   If nothing changes  what will the future look like   The intention of this exercise is to create a space where everyone s fears and worst case scenarios can be left on the table  Yes  it s like group therapy  Yes  it works     To answer the question   If nothing changes  what will the future look like   The intention of this exercise is to create a space where everyone s fears and worst case scenarios can be left on the table  Yes  it s like group therapy  Yes  it works  Visioning exercise   With the doom and gloom of the default future behind you  this practice lets the team rally around a future filled with newly launched products  delighted customers  and better climate control so it s not always freezing in the lunchroom     With the doom and gloom of the default future behind you  this practice lets the team rally around a future filled with newly launched products  delighted customers  and better climate control so it s not always freezing in the lunchroom  Stakeholder interviews  While business stakeholders are not to be considered a replacement to your customers  they will have perspective for you to hear and capture   These exercises will provide a solid foundation for you to assess the most pressing problems your business leaders are interested in   Your next constituent to consider is  of course  your customer   Customer priorities  If the customer is always right  why don t 100  of the products and services we create for them dazzle and delight  It s not because they don t know what they want  Everyone innately knows what they like and want   The problem stems from wanting one thing and choosing another  from saying one thing and doing another  from feeling one way and acting another   We know what we want  but sometimes we don t want the rest of the world to know  Sometimes we don t feel justified giving ourselves what we want  We re complex   And so the products and services we create for ourselves and others need to consider our triggers   What inspires us   What scares us   What we re willing to sacrifice   What we see  do  think  feel   Where we eat  sleep  work  play   Now add to the mix that each person consuming these products and services is different  On top of that  consider that the people often creating these products and services are not the customer  And herein lies the biggest challenge  understanding the inherent motivations of another human being   Then why don t our products and services work 100  of the time  Because people  teams  and companies create those products and services under the premise of   We don t need to talk to our customers we already know what they want    So  what are the steps we should should take to connect with our customers   Target personas   First  you need to define the people and groups you re creating solutions for  Afterward  make sure they remain visible throughout your work     First  you need to define the people and groups you re creating solutions for  Afterward  make sure they remain visible throughout your work  Customer research   Research is a shitty word only because of how it s been historically

those problems have the best shot of you building a business around  i e  problems where the customer would value a solution but which a good one doesn t currently exist  DVF  Up until now  both the company and customer have expressed their desires  And hopefully you ve identified the top 1 or 2 most desirable challenges   problems   jobs  Now you need to have some inkling of understanding that a potential solution would be viable  should you solve it   and feasible  can you solve it    Be careful here the design sprint itself is a tool you can use to ideate and test solutions  The point of doing a DVF at this stage is to be remotely confident that any related solution to your sprint challenge is remotely viable and feasible so that you don t waste too much time on good problems you won t or can t solve   Note  We ve also experimented with doing a DVF exercise at the end of Tuesday of sprint week  A lot of it will depend on your team s capabilities and the type of challenge you re working on   Bringing it all together  When you receive that nod that you ve finally gotten team and budget approval to run a design sprint  it will be overly tempting to dive in head first   Try your best to pause for a minute and consider that first impressions are lasting  Because someone said  go  doesn t mean your sprint should begin tomorrow   Spend a week experimenting with the exercises covered above with the goal of organizing your team around company and customer priorities  The space in which you discover viable  feasible problems worth solving to both  is the intersection that leads to high quality design sprint challenges   In the end  even if you decide to wing it and your first sprint bombs  you ll have planted the seed that things can improve from where they are today

969,training-dataset/product/584.txt,product,The Way We BuildThe Way We Build How rethinking the Airbnb app changed the way we approach design  This article kicks off an ongoing series on Airbnb s new Design Language System  Click here to read other installments   From an early age  I wanted to create things on screens  I began by experimenting with code  plotting pixels to form shapes and words  I became an engineer  Engineers created things  and could bring concepts to life   As time passed  tools emerged that allowed me to concentrate on interaction design  I m convinced that code remains one of the most powerful design tools  but software like Macromedia Director or Adobe Photoshop lets us move quicker  This has enabled a generation of designers to become the architects of the digital experiences we find ubiquitous today  I can t overstate how visual tools like Photoshop fundamentally changed the process of designing software and shaped the course of my career plotting pixels   The challenge today is that we are often still using the same methods we were 20 years ago  Tools don t communicate well  if at all  with each other  We continue to mock things up  The way we work today can broaden the gap between engineering and design  and the many layers between designing and building are a burden   We can do better  We can work better   The Collaboration Gap  Technology companies are expected to move at an incredible pace  and building software is complex  Add ever growing teams to the mix and you often end up with disjointed experiences  This has led us to try to better understand how multiple teams can efficiently collaborate to build great  cohesive software   Engineers have kept pace with this new reality  Building better tools and processes that allow hundreds  if not thousands of individuals  to contribute to a single codebase  Things aren t perfect  they rarely are  but coding today is fundamentally more efficient and collaborative than it was five let alone twenty years ago   Here s the simple truth  you can t innovate on products without first innovating the way you build them   Software design has unfortunately not evolved at a similar pace  The gap between designers and engineers has only increased  Design teams can often struggle to reach a cadence that balances the creative process and cycles of continuous innovation  Quality suffers  the experience becomes less cohesive  and talented people spend an inordinate amount of time simply managing communication across disciplines   Here s the simple truth  you can t innovate on products without first innovating the way you build them  Industrial design and architecture have operated under that premise for decades  At Airbnb  we want to invest in a better way to build  We believe we can achieve this by investing in our own internal tools  partnering with others to solve similar challenges  as well as supporting the community through open source projects and information sharing  A Better Way to Build  Our ambition required us to rethink some of the ways we worked  Today marks the rollout of the most ambitious update to our Airbnb app   a new entirely mobile way to explore the hosts  homes  and neighborhoods of our community   This process led us to the development of our new Design Language System  or DLS   as well as a suite of internal and third party tools that allow our teams to not only work smarter  but also closer  The DLS is a collection of components defined by shared principles and patterns  This allows for rapid iteration using a shared vocabulary across design  engineering  and other disciplines  The structure of the DLS is simple and coherent  easing communication across teams   Christopher Alexander  who wrote the seminal The Timeless Way of Building  states that  when language is shared  the individual patterns in the language are profound   For this to happen  these patterns need to be fundamentally simple   Nothing which is not simple and direct can survive the slow transmission from person to person    It focuses on common ingredients that follow our core design principles  unified  universal  iconic  and conversational  Universal and Unified define the system s approach we apply when defining patterns  Is it part of a greater whole  Does it work across devices  Iconic and Conversational help define the character of the system   its unique human qualities that tie back to our community and brand values   Designing the Workshop  The biggest existential threat to any system is neglect  The attrition generated by how difficult it is to use and maintain a cohesive system across various teams with their own specific needs  This is where our investment in tooling comes in  We are launching our brand new app with the help of an array of tools that work more coherently together  Like a well run workshop  our tools need to complement each other  This frees up space to focus on craft and creativity   Our newly formed design tools team is tasked with creating an environment built on top of the foundation of the DLS  We now have deep integration with third party tools  like Adobe Photoshop and Bohemian Coding s Sketch  allowing designers to quickly access all components and even real data from within the tools they use daily   We have also deployed homegrown efforts  like our native component browser and Airshots  which allows anyone at Airbnb to access thousands of screen permutations instantly  Imagine being able to see any screen from any version of our app in any language on any device that we support   The Future is Bright  Lastly  we re investing in code as a design tool  Moving closer to working with assets that don t only include layout and design  but also logic and data  This helps bridge the gap between engineers and designers  thus reducing the need for design specs or redlines and the steps between vision and reality   By focusing on the methods of working across disciplines  building better tools  and creating a unified system  we can use our time to apply creativity to solve bigger challenges  Over the coming months  we aim to be fully transparent and release detailed case studies on how our system is defined and what decisions go into designing components  patterns  and rules   There is a groundswell of activity that is helping us all get to a better place  The next year alone will see giant leaps in the way we design and build software  We are building a world where the differences between disciplines are blurred  where logic and design truly coexist  and where collaboration is not painful but inspiring,"[969 261 879 1024 556 523 1251 979 1260 862 8]"
971,training-dataset/product/193.txt,product,Bringing design sprints and product development togetherWe have what we d like to think is a pretty badass product development process at New Haircut and we keep it that way through constant and obsessive tweaking and tuning  I ve talked a lot about our reliance on design sprints  but the question we get most from the product teams we work with is   What happens after the sprint    A design sprint is a design thinking tool to help teams test big  important ideas before starting to build  We create prototypes within the sprint and attempt to validate them with targeted customers  Assuming we do collect the validation we need  the next challenge is connecting the insights uncovered during the sprint to effectively and efficiently build solutions or in a word  execution   So what our clients are really asking us is   How do we get from validation to execution  How do we take what we ve learned in the design sprint and code it into digital existence   Here s how we solved that challenge and how your team might think about approaching your product development process   Rethinking sprints for product development  In order to explain how we got to the point of successfully marrying our design sprints to product development  it s important to understand why and how we adopted design sprints in the first place   For the past 3 years we ve been supremely confident in our ability to execute our core UX UI design and software engineering services  If we knew what we were building and why  we could create some of the most killer digital products on the market  However  we relied on the teams who hired us or third party UX research firms to seed us with all the upfront research  validation  and roadmapping   The problem with this dynamic is that it s nearly impossible and in the best case scenario extremely inefficient for 1 team to research and validate problem solutions  and then have another team design and build those solutions   So about a year ago  the mastermind operator behind New Haircut and my co founder John Vetan sent me a link to GV s website about design sprints  the Sprint book had yet to be launched    Don t miss  Bringing design sprints inside your company  My first reaction was to doubt that anything worthwhile could be accomplished in 5 days  Thinking it over  though  if we could successfully implement sprints into our maturing design thinking and innovation practices  we d gain the ability to conduct that missing upfront research and validation  and it would enable us to follow the life of a product from start to finish  We could deliver better  more viable user centered products for our clients   After successfully adopting 5 day designs prints into our product development process  here s the approach we ve taken to marry design sprints with the core steps required to build  advance  and scale the solutions you ve validated within that design sprint   The 4 steps to move from sprint to execution  When you exit your 5 day design sprint  you should hopefully have validation of your sprint challenge and feel confident moving into product development   We ve implemented 4 steps to take all the insights gathered during the design sprint and jump into the actual execution of product development   Post sprint Build Advance Scale  1  Post sprint  During the week immediately following our design sprint  we run a follow up workshop  There are a few goals   To capture and share the big ideas that came out of the sprint we do this with a document we call a Replay  which summarizes key findings  recommendations  and a re assessment of our DVF criteria  To tease out all of the remaining Customer Journeys go back to your personas and connect your validated solution to the Job Stories your product will fulfill  To create a detailed plan of who  when  how the solution will be built we like to use the GO Product Roadmap by Roman Pichler  2  Build  One thing I see is that lot of companies start here  They skip the sprint and they skip that first post sprint step   We ve all been there wanting to jump into building solutions before we know enough about our business priorities or the customers we re serving  But if you ve gotten to the point where you ve run a successful sprint and completed some of the post sprint steps  you re now ready to plan your infrastructure  wireframe  design  code  test  and launch   One of the key activities we perform during our Build process is something we designed called a Code Sprint   This happens right before you enter into full blown product development where your application architects  data scientists  engineers  and product managers will probably need to clarify exactly how your product will be constructed  We developed a 5 day Code Sprint  yes  another sprint bear with us   to allow these folks on your team to research  develop  and test candidates for your product s architecture  infrastructure  frameworks  and libraries   3  Advance  During your sprint  you probably spent time defining the metrics that will matter most follow these like a compass to ensure the solutions you delivered are providing the business returns your stakeholders care about   Within this Advance phase  we re capturing  measuring  and iterating on our solutions based on what we re hearing and seeing from customers in a production environment   4  Scale   One of the biggest misconceptions we run into as we talk to teams and executives about design sprints is that sprints are completed as standalone projects   If design sprints are going to provide sustained value  they and all of the related design thinking practices  tools  and processes need to be baked into the company culture  This is the main goal during our Scale step   enrolling others by showcasing the success of this project  training them  and then carrying that momentum into future initiatives   Wrapping up  Design sprints have provided us with a super efficient tool for validating big ideas before plowing head first into product development  Hopefully New Haircut s tale of conceptualizing and implementing this process can provide your team with some clues about how to transition from your design sprints into the actual building  testing  and scaling of your products and services   In a later piece  we ll discuss the steps you should take prior to a design sprint to ensure your sprint aligns well with the business priorities and has the best chance of solving the right problems your customers care

979,training-dataset/product/21.txt,product,How a global design team works collaborativelyJust over a year ago  Lightspeed made the shift within our product team to a broader global design approach   Our team now consists of designers from around the world who provide valuable input on our retail  restaurant  and ecommerce products  Our mission is to provide independent retailers and restaurants with cloud based point of sale solutions that help them seamlessly run their business   With 8 offices in 4 time zones  we needed to figure out a solid way to work well together while listening to the changing needs of our customers   Related  An inside look at how Envato s agile UX team works  Beautiful yet easy to use software has always been a core philosophy of the company and an important value of the growing global design team  Here s a look at the tools and techniques we use to maintain communication and consistency as a team to continuously deliver great products no matter how far apart physically we may be   A team across time zones  Our product design team isn t the largest  which has been a big plus for us  It allows us to be really flexible and quick to adopt new ways of collaborating   We have a total of 10 designers working on our 3 products  The team is a mix of unique skill sets  Our team has everything from visual design artists to masterminds of interaction and some designers even design directly in code   Our philosophy is to have a good mix of designers who will challenge and push each other out of their comfort zones and continuously learn new skills  Collaborating with designers from different cultural and design backgrounds has proven extremely useful in creating a global suite of products   Collaboration tools  In order to achieve greatness as a team  it s important to have some similarity in the tools everyone uses   At Lightspeed  we have a  use whatever tool feels most comfortable for you  policy  but we do ask that if a designer uses a different tool  they need to be able to teach it to other designers as well  Tools are ways of solving design problems but aren t the solutions themselves  We do  however  have some standards in our design toolbox which we all need to use   The most crucial part of successful collaboration is communication  which often gets forgotten  We use Slack as our main communication tool  for a variety of reasons   In order to be consistent with our designs  we work in a so called  design system   We actually have 2 main systems  which we manage inside Github  a crucial tool for our collaboration   Last but not least is InVision  which helps us to share complete flows and gather feedback from all various stakeholders  Since a lot of our communication is text based  the InVision commenting tool helps us move faster by allowing us to give precise comments on designs  For prototyping  we use a diverse set of tools depending on the project   The combination of these tools keeps our workflow running smoothly  but as with anything in the tech industry  we continue to move forward and switch tools as needed   How we collaborate  When you re working across multiple countries and time zones  communication becomes even more important  Instead of face to face conversations  you re sending a lot of messages and talking via video chat  so how do you make sure your designers keep on sharing their work for feedback   The obvious way would be doing a weekly design critique  which we do   but we also have a daily design standup meeting within our private Slack channel  By using screenshots of InVision projects during the standup  designers can show what they re working on and discuss how far along they are in the process  This allows us to share early stage designs all the time and get feedback as we progress   The open communication and feedback ensures everyone feels empowered to share early stage designs  which is extremely helpful  Not only will you find product designers reading  responding  and sharing on this Slack channel our marketing design team and design loving CEO are on there as well   This mix of unique views on different projects provides a lot of valuable feedback  Once a final flow is ready to be shared company wide  we create a single InVision flow and post the link inside a public design channel to gather as much feedback as possible  This continuous sharing helps us stay consistent and aligned as a company   Each time one of our own Sketch templates gets updated  we get a notification in our Slack channel  Github works great for this and allows us to all stay in the loop   Github is where the real magic of collaboration happens for us  Not only do our design systems live there  but also all our  final  designs per product  we use  final  with the understanding that all designs can still evolve    Each product has its own Github repository with 3 main folders  Assets  assets for developers   Resources  all flows and designs   and Playground  all little experiments   Having this inside a repository has multiple advantages  Developers feel comfortable in this environment and with the version control plus  knowing when something has been added doesn t hurt either   The repository for our systems contains a Sketch template for both styles  and a folder with all elements exported for showing differences when updated  Every designer is free to create a Pull Request  PR  to update one of our systems  In each PR  the designer states why the change is needed and what it improves on  PRs are also a perfect way to have a focused discussion in one place  This helps a lot for documentation and future reference   In the end  it really doesn t matter how you update your teammates  as long as you do  Although working as a team from different time zones might seem challenging at first  it s proven to be a fun and rewarding experience for us here at Lightspeed  thanks to the variety of platforms we use,"[979 8 1173

1012,training-dataset/product/1109.txt,product,Frequently asked questions about design sprintsAt New Haircut  we ve had the opportunity to lead design sprints for companies big and small  We ve run sprints that managed to unite a dismantled team  that rescued a v1 product launch that nearly put a company out of business  and that saved a company from spending another 12 months building the wrong thing   In this article we re going to share some sprint fundamentals that have made our engagements successful  The goal is to impart you with as much knowledge as we can  so that you can avoid some of the pitfalls we ve had to climb out of  Onward   Do design sprints need to be 5 full days   The very nature and name of a sprint implies that speed is what s most important  In reality  structure is the breadwinner  Structure in the sprint process is what enables speed  However  in our early days  there were plenty of instances where we tried to cut corners  We ve also felt the pressure to squeeze more in  But just about every time we deviated  the company that hired us suffered   For example  there have been times we ve run a second or third sprint with a company because the first sprint showed us we were  for example  attacking the wrong challenge  In scenarios like these  we ve been able to skip day one  But what s not advisable is trying to run your first sprint in less than 5 full days   Related  There s often a temptation for some of the team to duck out early  We recommend you stick to your guns here and force the entire team to hang around for the entire duration  Why   Scenario  1  Say one team member arrives several hours late for one of the days  Two things tend to happen from here   The team loses about an hour reviewing what they ve accomplished for the day   big momentum killer Because that missing person wasn t part of the discussion  they wind up challenging topics with arguments the team already has clarity on  Scenario  2  One common request we field is during day 5   people turn to us and say   You guys have got this  We re gonna go catch up on work and then we can sync later  Cool    Not cool   There are 3 big downfalls   If and when your customers push back on your prototypes  those who skip out on the interviews tend to resist and or over challenge the negative feedback Instead of being able to wrap up the final interview and move straight into feedback and decisions  one or more of the team will need to summarize everything in a report or presentation and schedule time the following week to review everything with the entire sprint team Because that review will happen after the weekend  not only will the focus of the sprint become interrupted  but the team will likely need to rehash topics that were fresh last week  Is one sprint enough   One of the most popular questions we hear is   What happens if our prototype doesn t get the reactions we were hoping for   This is actually very normal and  at times  the outcome you re looking for  Let me explain   Sometimes you get together on day one and everyone in the room agrees that this is the challenge to attack  But then you build your prototype and put it in front of customers and they point you in a different direction   The good news here is that you were able to spot this mis step within 5 days  What would have happened if you realized it after 5 weeks  After 5 months   You don t know what you don t know  But that s the spirit of keeping the sprint process contained within 5 days  Regardless  you re going to walk away from each sprint knowing oodles more about your customers and market than you did before even if you test the wrong thing   Remember the famous Thomas Edison quote about his failures while inventing the light bulb    I have not failed  I ve just found 10 000 ways that won t work    And so the question that tends to immediately follow is   Well  now what do we do    You run another sprint   Again  chances are you ll be able to to move faster this time around since you can cut out day one  You may only need a few hours on day 2 if the challenge you picked was right but the solution was a shade off  The logistics of your next sprint will firm up once you complete the analysis of your customer interviews   Do we really need to completely clear our calendars   If someone on your team doesn t freak out about clearing their calendar for 5 days and or not being allowed to bring their phones and laptops into the sprint room  it will be a first  Everyone is busy  Everyone experiences some degree of terror by not being able to check their email every 4 minutes   If you run a true design sprint  you won t have a minute for anything else  And consider this fact   It takes the average human 20 minutes to regain their full attention after even the slightest interruption   Remember  it s recommended that everyone be allowed to catch up on all administrative tasks from 8 9am every day  But from 9 to 5  those are sprint lockdown hours   So  block out your calendar for 5 days  You will live  And your inbox will be there waiting for you next week   Should you speak with customers prior to the sprint   In short  yes   The sprint is 5 days  but there s also a day zero  This is the time leading up to the sprint  During this time  there s no cap on the amount of customers you can meet with  There s also no shortage of data you can capture and share with the sprint team  The more prepared you are  and the more armed with data you are  the more poised you ll be on day one   Do we need 7 people to run a sprint   Not necessarily  We ve talked about core roles we recommend in this article  What s more important is that you clearly define each role   One often overlooked role is the person in charge of organizing the sprint and keeping the wheels in motion  the facilitator  We ve tried and failed to facilitate by committee  Likewise  we stumbled when designating one person as the facilitator who had another function on the team  too  Facilitating  like the other roles  is a full time thing   And so the question that naturally follows is   Should we bring in outsiders to fill in the gaps in our team   Yes and no   You need those core roles  So if you re lacking any  you ll want to source that missing talent  Just try to avoid employing individual designers  product managers  and engineers  Why  Team chemistry is a big deal during sprints  That means your best bet is retaining a small team or firm even better if they come stacked with design sprint experience   Since this is just a prototype  do we need a designer   I m going answer this by quoting Braden Kowitz of Google Ventures   Sometimes companies don t have designers on their team  so we can step in to help out during a sprint  The only potential downside to augmenting a sprint team is that sometimes the core team won t have the skills to continue the project after the sprint   Companies are often hesitant to hire designers early  They ask  Do we need a designer at this stage  What would that designer do  Can we just hire a freelancer for a day to mock up some of our sketches   But after working with designers during a sprint  companies often have a much better understanding of how design can impact their company   What if we re having trouble finding customers to interview   There was this project we bid on once where the target demographic were middle aged  married women in Dubai  Local laws prohibited men in our company from contacting them without their husbands  consent  So we recruited the help of local  unmarried women to contact these women and get their husbands  consent ahead of time   I m guessing your customers are more accessible  And if they aren t  there are ways to get them to come in or minimally get them to agree to a Hangout or Skype session   Remember  you only need  at least  5 customers  And when desperate measures call  offer them a  50 gift card for their time   What if my team isn t willing to commit to a sprint   We previously covered the topic of getting your team committed and ready to go   However  a popular and related set of quotes we hear from companies is  We already did that   Or  We paid a company to write an RFP  We re not gonna start over    Or  We ve been doing this for 10 years  We know how our customers think    These are often companies operating from a place of fear  Fear of uncertainty  Fear of losing time  Fear of doing something differently   If you re that person in the company fighting against the current  you only need to

at every company I visit  As the VP of Design Education at InVision  I study how design works and breaks in businesses  After nearly a decade of leading product teams I know first hand that design is indeed hard  even at a company that values and invests in it   What makes it so difficult  There are organizational challenges  people challenges  and process challenges  Each seems monolithic in its own right  but when you stack them up they feel daunting   I once thought that the challenges I faced as a design leader were unique to my situation  but I know now after interviewing many design leaders they re common to almost every team  I find it comforting to know I m not the only one who has struggled  and not because misery loves company  though it does   If these problems are common  then chances are we can find solutions   Design leaders far and wide are struggling to find solutions to these 7 problems   1  Isolation  Agile has become the law of the land and it has redrawn team lines on many an org chart  Designers are finding themselves embedded in cross functional teams with engineers and product owners  It s a great opportunity to learn from others with different perspectives  but it often leaves designers craving the feedback and camaraderie of other designers that s needed to improve their craft  In isolation  many designers feel their growth has stagnated as has their career  Designers disenchanted with their work can find themselves searching for greener pastures where their creativity can be more freely expressed   Outnumbered as they often are in cross functional teams  designers acquiesce to engineers who encourage smaller design iterations and a simpler approach  Do we really need that animated transition  Does it add much value  It s difficult to champion the necessity of small details when you re the lone designer  Many simply give in and get back to work  Exceptional design is almost impossible to achieve when corners are continuously cut   I see a few strategies emerging as companies recognize the challenges of cross functional product teams  Some companies like Spotify and Envato are experimenting with design guilds which bring designers from many teams together for regular design reviews and discussion of design strategy and style  This approach helps designers get the feedback they need to grow  but still doesn t address the awkward power dynamic of being the only designer in a product team   Designer Diogenes Brito in conversation with a colleague at Slack  Photo Credit  Fastco Design  Slack pairs designers on projects so they get the feedback they need to work through ideas quickly and thoroughly    Pair design gives you a partner in crime to help you explore ideas  It s two people with similar or complementary skills riffing off each other  Plus when you have two people  it helps you get unstuck faster when you hit a roadblock   Diogenes Brito  Slack  Other companies are simply moving designers back to a dedicated design team where creative exploration and design vision come more easily  The pitfall here is that design and engineering aren t afforded as much opportunity to collaborate and learn from each other  Perhaps there s a middle ground  I ve seen success from temporary product teams in which designers and engineers tackle a big project together then return home to their respective teams  It lets these differing cultures build rapport without totally assimilating as they re forced to do in a cross functional team   The jury is still out on how we ll solve the problems of team structure  We need to experiment more and compare notes   2  Lost Vision  As teams divide to specialize on domains or areas of a product  the shared vision for the product can get lost  Designers feel the loss of a product vision most acutely as they need a North Star to guide their design systems   Design leadership is needed to define vision that extends past the incremental improvements of sprints  Some design teams create large boards that show design style or tell the story of how their product will fit into the lives of their customers  Others create short videos to illustrate to all how the product will fit into the customer s lifestyle   Airbnb worked with Pixar illustrators to create storyboards that showed how their products would fit into the lives of their customers  Their storyboard gave everyone a vision of the product experience they wanted but still gives each team the freedom to solve the problems as they see fit   Airbnb collaborating with Pixar illustrators on a storyboard to communicate the vision for the company  Photo credit  FastCo Design  Product roadmaps also guide teams  but they only express what to do and when  They don t tell a company why  Vision whether presented through a video  storyboard  or some other means gives purpose and clarity to our work  Without it teams often lose sight of their mission   3  Inconsistent Broken UX  As a company grows and acquires other companies  product UIs quickly become a hodgepodge of styles creating a clunky user experience  Inconsistent UIs bloat code  are difficult to maintain  and make new product ideation inefficient   Large enterprises like IBM  Atlassian  Salesforce and Westpac are starting to invest in design systems that not only standardize UI with a library of patterns for designers and developers to follow  they re also adding user personas and broad design principles to their systems   Design systems work best when they re managed by a dedicated team  There is a new type of team emerging around design systems  Design System Ops  Spotify s design guilds regularly communicate with their design system team to keep their UIs and code efficient across platforms   Approach a design system as you would a marathon  not a sprint  You re laying the groundwork for an extensive effort  By understanding your organization through its product portfolio  you ll strengthen a cornerstone   the design system   that will help you achieve a stronger and more cohesive experience  Nathan Curtis  EightShapes  LLC  4  Speaking a New Language  Designers struggle to speak the language of business as a company scales  They have to interact with new executives and engineers and communicate the ideas behind their work and how it will help the business succeed  They can t get lost in the weeds talking about typefaces  they need to talk about empowering customers   Designers need to learn more about the business they serve and business in general  They need to get to know the people in charge and ask questions   Despite the impact design has on the success of a business  it s rare to see a designer in an executive position  There are many reasons for this  not least of which is that design leaders need to become adept at speaking the language of executives  The C suite is dominated by talk of statistics and data  territory that can be uncomfortable for designers as our work is not always quantifiable  That doesn t mean it s not creating value  though   Designers need to be able to articulate the value of a great user experience and frame design in the context of business goals    As designers  I think we re really good at researching what our users need and understanding where they are coming from  their emotional state and sometimes we don t think to apply that same rigor to the people in our own companies    Laura Martini  5  Building Social Capital  When a business grows  more people need to come together to ship great things  Designers who succeed in large organizations create social capital by developing a rapport with colleagues across the organization  Product design in large organizations is not a solo activity  Take off your headphones  Get up and talk to people  Designers who don t make an effort to work across teams will inevitably be deselected from their organization  Count on it    You don t earn a leadership position with your headphones on    Ryan Page  CapitalOne  Get in the habit of grabbing lunch with a developers  No need for an agenda   just get to know each other  Spend time with researchers who have their finger on the pulse of your customers  sales people who hear frequent requests  and customer service agents who know where users struggle the most  All have valuable context to offer  Each one influences the success of the product   As designers become connected to colleagues on other teams  not only will their designs be more informed  they ll also create inroads into their work  putting design on everyone s radar    The graph of impact tends to correlate with how many people you need to work effectively with  Once I realized this  I started to see my interactions with other people differently  It was no longer about winning battles and proving that I was right  but about developing stronger collaborative relationships    Julie Zhou  Product Design VP at Facebook  6  Incremental Not Innovative  In the early days of a startup everything that s shipped feels big and innovative  As the product matures and the customer base grows the company will be much more conservative in what it ships  valuing optimization and stability over innovation  Everything gets broken into small sprints that can feel incremental  not innovative  Many designers find this frustrating as the problems may seem less interesting   Designers need a safe place to explore new ideas  Teams can schedule 20  time to explore new concepts for existing products or for brand new ideas  Some companies establish a dedicated R D team to fuel innovation  or plan creative retreats where a team can experiment    If we re to avoid becoming creatively bankrupt  we have to do things that are high risk    Ed Catmull  Pixar  Companies that lose touch with experimentation will find barbarians at the door soon enough  ready to disrupt their business   7  Moving Slower  Early on there are a select few people who create product strategy and the roadmap  But as a company scales there are more stakeholders involved in the process  Things slow down as more teams need to touch the product before shipping  Designers who were involved early on can become frustrated that they can t move as quickly as they d like  and may find themselves looking for another company still in the early stages of development so they can tackle problems quickly once again   It s important to remember that speed isn t everything  though  Large companies may move slower  but often have far greater influence than scrappy startups  Shipping slower but reaching more people can be satisfying too   Sound Familiar   Does any of this resonate with you  If so  know that you re not alone  Every company I ve talked to regardless of their market sector is wresting with the same issues  But seeing the patterns makes it easier for us to find solutions   How are you solving these problems in your organization  Are there other problems you re confronting  Let s spark an honest discussion in the comments of this article  There s so much we can learn from each other,"[1024 261 523 879 1251 8 862

1082,training-dataset/product/904.txt,product,4 things I learned designing user interfaces for VR at DisneyThe VR space is heating up real quick  Recently  I was fortunate enough to work at Walt Disney Studios as the Lead UI Designer on the Disney Movies VR product team   It was my first ever VR project  and I d like to share a few grab and go lessons I learned that are applicable to both the mobile device VR environment as well as higher end headsets   1  Print design is relevant to VR design  VR is an interesting space to design for because it s this overlap of technology  visual design  and interface design  Where it differs is the approach   Having experience both in graphic design and UI design  I can tell you VR is a strange mix of the 2 and it s more relevant to print design than anything else  Yes  you re designing for a  screen   but things designed in space are 100  relevant to your spatial relationship to it  Screens  and specifically typography  lend themselves very much to the same relationships you d find and leverage in the real world   I found myself asking questions like   How big should this type be to be readable   only to realize later that these precedents existed in billboards  posters  and even books  When it comes to design  you can never get away from typography  And when it comes to typography in space  virtual or real it s all about the readability and communication   tl dr Print has solved the issue of readability for the real world  No need to reinvent the wheel for the virtual world   2  Be strategic with your targets  The tricky thing about VR is the method of input  During my time at Disney  we optimized for gaze based navigation  assuming that our users would have limited or no input capability at all  This means that the crosshair reticle cursor was also your button click if you hovered over an interactive object long enough   The challenge this presents is making sure your users don t fall into a black hole of button clicks as they re browsing through your information architecture  We intentionally designed our UI to be out the cone of focus after users invoke a specific action  This encouraged even more intentional actions for invoking and accessing VR content   tl dr Users might gaze naturally in the center after invoking a thumbnail  Putting your targets out of the natural gaze position will prevent accidental clicks   Example   3  It s important to create mockups in VR  Mockups and comps are great for soliciting team and stakeholder buy in  but the only way to truly dog food what you ve designed is to throw your design into VR space  You give yourself permission to see it in the world it s designed to be in  Size  space  colors are suddenly being consumed spatially and really give you an opportunity to be critical with the work you ve done   While stumbling through this process  I cobbled together a workflow that let me crudely view flat mocks as a spherical skin in my Google Cardboard viewer  There s still a huge opportunity for prototyping in this space  as there currently exists a large void  At Disney  we were lucky enough have our engineering partners facilitate this by providing prototyping software for us to view our flat UI designs   tl dr Design comps are great  but you really need to view them in a headset to get an idea of what you re designing   4  Feedback is everything  Visual  auditory  haptic I d argue that feedback becomes even more critical in VR because of the low barrier to distract a user  Where UI design s limitations were previously viewport  VR opens up an entire world to interact with  Buttons and links can now look like portals  objects  and regular old desktop items   This is where I think game design becomes largely relevant  Surface feedback in some form and to do so consistently so users understand what  rules  they have for invoking objects and actions  Also important after establishing your visual language and rulebook is to remain consistent with it  No one wants to figure out why your buttons are 2 different colors   tl dr  Give users feedback when they hover over something interactive  The more feedback the better  because a VR environment can be pretty distracting   Check out some unused design directions below  We opted for scale  color  and animation   Wrapping it up  If you re a designer in the VR space  there s still a lot of great design thinking to be had these are just some I stumbled upon  For the most part the principles of design still apply and are probably more relevant than ever  Have any other awesome thoughts or insights  I d love to hear them  seriously    This was originally published on Medium,"[1082 149 8 1251 523 1109 1260 1173 35 879 261]"
1098,training-dataset/product/772.txt,product,Bringing design sprints inside your companyDesign sprints are consuming conversations among all sorts of makers from authors testing out new book concepts to software teams working on the next VR breakthroughs   Who wouldn t love a prescriptive framework that enables you to validate your biggest ideas in 5 days   But design sprints are new and disruptive to traditional approaches  That probably means that if you re the one minting design sprints inside your company  you re probably also struggling to get others to play ball   Non believers  When I first read about Google Ventures  design sprints  I was excited and suspicious  I was brainwashed at Accenture to believe project plans always needed months of gathering requirements and spec writing before a single discussion could take place about product design  How on Earth  then  could anything practical be accomplished in 5 days    Related  Inside Design at Google Ventures  But then something happened I sat in on our first sprint we ran with a New Haircut client  Sure  it was sloppy compared to how we run sprints today  but even in that beautiful disaster there was an obvious lift in thinking  collaboration  energy  and speed  We  and our clients  were instantly hooked   Over the past year we ve run dozens of sprints against our own ideas  as well as for the companies that hire us to design and build their digital products  But now  more and more  we re talking with people on teams inside companies that have attempted to bring design sprints into their culture and hitting stiff arm after stiff arm  from navigating changing processes  to getting business leadership to agree  to the bevy of other 1 line excuses   Let s break down these 3 types of pushback and arm you with some specific tips to help you bring design sprints into your organization  successfully   New is scary  For many  the idea of changing anything stirs up angst  When we kick off with large organizations to train their product teams on design thinking we hear all sorts of grunts and groans  For example  project managers want to know how a sprint will impact budgets and timelines  The truth is  by spending these 5 well orchestrated days upfront  we ve seen product development budgets and timelines shrink by up to 75   That s PM gold right there   Tip  Share these 2 case studies published on Google Ventures to turn your PMs into your biggest advocates   Likewise  creative directors squirm that their design processes are already  lean    agile   or both  But I bet they d love a way to efficiently capture stakeholder and customer insights upfront so their design teams had better direction with the solutions they were building   Tip  Ask them to define how the current design process works  After they re done rambling for 20 minutes  spend 5 walking them through Duco an app we designed to introduce design sprints to anyone  at any level  in any function    5 days in a row will never happen   Everyone is busy  That s why one of the biggest gripes we hear from people  especially those operating in corporate environments where you have meetings to plan for meetings  is that the idea of spending 5 days on a single topic seems impossible   But the issue is that they ve never had a real process  brainstorming is not a process  to raise an important challenge and identify a solution that didn t involve weeks of emails  stakeholder interviews  meetings  and more meetings  Design sprints now provide that exact framework   When these same people complete their first design sprint with us  not a single individual leaves the sprint week without acknowledging how much time they could have saved over their career had they adopted the process sooner   Tip  Try to convince the team to spend time getting through Day 1 of the sprint  This should provide enough insight into how powerful the sprint can be  to get them to agree to finish the remaining 4 days   Tip  A sprint team is ideally 4 7 people  If some refuse to spend all 5 days  try to get them commit to Monday  half of Tuesday  and half of Wednesday  The rest of the days can be managed by a core team of 2 4 people  and even  worst case  summarized for the larger team on Friday or 1 day the following week   When all else fails  pick an excuse   We ve tried brainstorming meetings     Our customers don t know what they want     We already did our research     We are the customer     We know what we have to build    Most of us are creatures of habit and comfort  We trust what we know already  So when it comes to deciding how to solve a really important problem  most of us want to jump right to the solution  We convince ourselves and others around us that we already know everything we need to know and can just get started   Unfortunately  it s typically not until weeks or months later that the hard questions appear and you need to start from the beginning  all over again   Instead  design sprints provide you with the tools and techniques to enable a team of individuals to arrive at the right solution  together  in 5 days   Tip  When you hear the excuses come rolling in  ask out loud   If this idea is so important  doesn t it make sense to spend a week making sure we re taking the best approach to solving it    Can your company afford for the answer to ever be  no  here   Still stuck  No matter what you try and how persuasive you may be  for some companies  design sprints will always been considered DOA  If you ve hit this point and feel you ve done everything you can  attend 1 of our upcoming design sprint workshops to ensure your team is engaged and your sprints run successfully,"[1098 971 566 942 1012 948 665 1400 1250 399 523]"
1109,training-dataset/product/1276.txt,product,Learning about product design from famous SaaS foundersEditor s note  This article features ideas and interview fragments from Jane Portman s new book  The UI Audit   When I quit my cushy position of creative director and started out as an independent UI UX consultant 4 years ago  I couldn t help my frustration with the startup industry  Nearly none of the products I designed ever saw the light of day   That was my first biggest discovery  the software world isn t all roses and unicorns   My perception changed as my consulting practice gained traction I learned that there are people who successfully ship their SaaS products and make a living off them  I was lucky enough to have some of them as clients  Amazing clients  But I still had to learn a lot about software design  in real life    UI UX design is just a tool for product design  which is way more strategic  It s often more important what we design  not how we do it   This article should help you obtain a more realistic view of the SaaS industry  For my latest book  The UI Audit  I interviewed some super successful SaaS founders  and today I d love to share some of their insights on product design    Good enough  design will absolutely do the job  Everybody loves great design  But most often that s just a declaration  When it comes to practice  design is a mere cog in a complex  multi faceted business  And it s not a critical cog  Just imagine other issues that founders deal with  development  marketing  sales  payment processing  security  payroll  anything else   Great design can be a competitive advantage  while poor design can be a bottleneck in a SaaS business  causing customer churn and other problems  However  it s never white or black  Founders often overlook design issues unless they re absolutely critical  Or unless they make design a top priority but it happens way less often than we think   Are you familiar with the concept of good enough parents  This concept exists because it s impossible to be perfect parents  Nor is it possible to achieve perfect design in a living product  especially if it s a self funded business  The true polish costs thousands of dollars and is only affordable for the industry giants   Here s what Ankur Nagpal  founder of Teachable  previously Fedora   says about software design    My key advice is  early on focus on making things not ugly  And then I think it s 2 stages first tier of design is  not ugly   second stage is making things beautiful  The good thing is  in today s day and age there s so many tools you have at your disposal to make things look not terrible  And I think that s something you should totally leverage    Whenever the subject of UI design drives you crazy  please refer to these 2 lists  They will help you stay sane   Here s what UI design should do   Do what s promised on the marketing website  Get out of the user s way while they re accomplishing their goals with your software  Satisfy the founder s taste  it s essential to sympathize with things that you create and sell  Be decent looking  in order not to scare customers off  Here s what UI design shouldn t do   Please everybody  it s impossible   Be a piece of art  utility is way more important   Be unique  unique interfaces have a steep learning curve   As a designer  do you see any place for your wild creativity here  Your life will get so much easier if you accept the fact that the world doesn t revolve around your creative persona   Product strategy precedes UI design  A product strategy defines what features you should build  and how you should build them   Product strategy can be defined as a combination of 4 variables   Audience  Who are your ideal users  Goal  What big goal do they have in mind when they sign up  Tasks  What tasks do they perform daily when they log into your web app  Objects  What items do the users handle while performing these tasks   Only when you fix all these variables  at least for one iteration  will you be able to build a focused  profitable product  First  you define what features deserve to be implemented  And second  you approach each screen layout keeping those key tasks in mind   Here s what Rob Walling  founder of Drip  says about their product strategy    We didn t just want to build features that doesn t help  You have to have some type of vision for where you re headed  And when we made the decision that we are going to become like a lower cost  high value marketing automation platform  then you instantly know what to build and what not to build   You re not going to build shopping cart software onto it  which some people are requesting  You re not going to build an affiliate management program  you re not going to build landing pages probably  You re not going to build that CRM upfront  There s a bunch of things that you don t need  and then we can really focus on exactly what we needed to build    Research is essential  As designers  we often suggest certain design solutions based solely on our own opinion  Some founders take the same approach  But it s doomed to fail the way to build a successful product is to go out and see what s happening in the world   Here are the most popular forms of product research   Passive observation  Amy Hoy defines that as sales safari exploring public forums in search of existing customer pains  Direct interaction  Customer interviews and surveys  Review of competing or legacy products  Calendly is a scheduling tool featuring the most spectacular design  Its design is amazing  very clean and functional  Calendly s founder  Tope Awotona  reviewed over 30 scheduling apps during his research phase   As a non technical founder  Tope didn t have unlimited resources to iterate on his product idea  So his goal was to build the right set of features from day one  using customer discovery and his own judgement    I didn t outsource customer discovery to the engineers  I did it myself  I signed up for every single one of legacy scheduling tools  I became an expert at using every single one of them  I read through their support portals  what did people really like about the product  what did they hate about the product  what were they complaining about  what did they like  what did they not like  It s very important to know what people already like in tools they have  and what they feel is missing or poorly executed    Only after extensive customer research Drip founders were able to nail their product positioning as  lightweight email marketing automation   And these months were quite agonizing until the right decision was made    It was not an overwhelming majority  it was not like  Boy  90  of people said you should go into marketing automation  it was not like that at all  There was a lot of signals  there was a lot of noise in sifting through it  It was kind of like okay  so the first step is to build some automation stuff   It was not obvious that we had made the right decision  I mean  when we first broke ground on this code  I asked folks if this is what they wanted  But you have 200 people  300 people giving you their opinion and it s hard to figure out what to build  So it was a good couple of months of kind of agonizing over which direction do we take this  what are we actually building here    Saying  no  to new features is the founder s most important job  Dealing with the feature creep is the founder s biggest challenge  Founders are bombarded with feature requests on a daily basis  and it s their most important job is to say  no  to the vast majority of them   Here s what Tope Awotona of Calendly says about simplicity    Everyone sets out to build a simple product  nobody ever sets out to build an advanced product  But I think the challenge that you re faced with is what s really  really important  what 80  of the users can benefit from 80  of the time  versus what helps 5  of the users 5  of the time   And the same people who would love the product for its simplicity want to add a lot more complexity to it  They say they want to keep it simple  which is true  But if you add in all the features  it wouldn t be simple anymore    Here are the questions you can use to qualify new features   Does this feature serve your exact ideal customer  or does it make your product interesting to new customer categories   Does this feature serve the user s big goal  or does it add other goals to their plate  even if solved successfully    Does this feature facilitate the user s most important daily tasks  or does it add other tasks to their plate   Does this feature breed new objects to be managed with the app   Does this feature solve a pain  or does it merely add an extra layer of polish   What are the development and support     costs of building this feature   Can this feature be easily replaced by building an integration with another software product   What part of the existing user base will benefit from this new feature and start using it immediately   Final words  Hope you enjoyed these founder insights  If you re interested in  real life  UI UX design of web applications  you re welcome to learn

business  try to think beyond layout and typography  Consider a larger picture of the product  Try to put yourself in the shoes of the founder who has to juggle multiple things on multiple plates   Try to get a more strategic vision  This will make you a wiser  more empathetic designer  This will help you get better clients and create the work you re proud of,"[1109 523 261 149 879 301 1024 1251

1173,training-dataset/business/1474.txt,business,Inside Design  SquarespaceFounded on the belief that there should be an all in one solution to creating a beautiful online home  Squarespace makes great design accessible to anyone with an idea and a drive to make something no security patches or webmasters needed   Over the last 5 years  with design as a priority  they ve grown from a 60 person company to almost 600  That s just one of many reasons we re proud to say they re part of the InVision community  We sat down with Billy Sweeney  Design Lead  and Danni Fisher  Product Designer  to find out how Squarespace s design team operates   How is the Squarespace design team set up   Danni  Our product design team consists of 7 designers  We re part of the broader creative team of 20 designers that includes brand marketing  frontsite  platform  and templates   Our team structure is fairly flat  Designers champion different areas of the product  like CMS  commerce  mobile  domains  circle  and everything in between   Related  How to design your design team  What makes this team structure effective  and are there things you ve changed along the way to make it better   Billy  We ve changed our structure a fair amount over the years as we ve grown we re always looking for the most effective organization  Our mostly flat structure allows each of us to work on the things we re passionate about  which gives the team room to shift around as different needs surface  We recently evened out the number of direct reports that each manager has  which helped a lot in putting together an efficient team   Danni  This year  we introduced a product design weekly sync lead by our Director of Product Design  Michael Heilemann  The meeting focuses on what we re up to and how we re thinking  rather than just providing progress updates  It s loosely formatted  lasting 1 2 hours  but each sync starts with high level company updates and then dives into an opportunity for each designer to share his or her work and thoughts on the creative process   We aren t timeboxed and it doesn t matter what work is presented the most important aspect is that each team member has the opportunity to share something  At the very least it s a chance to work on presentation and communication skills   Collectively  we offer critiques and ideas to help teammates think through a particular problem they may be stuck on  The transparency that comes with sharing our work and thought process is key   We also started doing weekly 30 minute peer one on one hangouts as an opportunity for team members to gain a deeper understanding of another designer s project and all its nuances  Each project at Squarespace runs deep  and each designer becomes a  specialist  in his or her respective area  so the goal is to share that knowledge  Again  these hangouts are not to find solutions  but for both parties to ask lots and lots of questions   Billy  As I m based in Portland  and the rest of the team is in New York  So I find these one on ones particularly useful  I m given the chance to hop on a video call and screen share for about 30 minutes  It s a nice way to go more in depth on a project  to understand the stakeholders  to share technical tips and tricks  and to foster community   What s the design culture like at Squarespace   Danni  These days it seems like every hour there s a new product  site  app  TV series  or piece of writing to check out  Staying current is a huge part of the design culture forming opinions on the things we ve tested  asking questions about the things we haven t   Related  What exactly is a design culture   In a great creative culture  people feel free to share ideas  opinions  and criticisms  Designers usually have some sort of obsession that gives them an angle from which to measure good design  Whether you love typography  woodwork  film  music  or math  it s that ability to make comparisons that translates into a sense of  good taste  and valued contribution   In a broader sense  great company culture comes from caring for the product  brand  and the users  When you re surrounded by people who share a common goal  communication channels open up  the vibe is positive  and a natural form of camaraderie develops   Billy  Our leadership team plays a major role in establishing the company culture by way of hiring decisions  communication styles  and opportunities given to employees  Our CEO sits right next to us  in the same kind of chair  at the same custom concrete desk  with the same computer equipment everyone else has  This sends a profound message to the company about equality of ideas  and the fact that he s not tucked away in a glass office somewhere in a suit speaks volumes to the entire organization   How does your team communicate with each other  And how do you communicate with people on different teams at your organization   Danni  The product design team sits in a group  allowing for a lot of in person communication  We ve experimented with different seating arrangements to see whether designers should sit together  or if we should be seated next to other colleagues like engineers or product managers with whom we work closely   Currently  we re finding it valuable to be closer to other designers  That said  we often move around to sit with other team members depending on our projects  needs  It s interesting to see how communication shifts depending on where you re seated  You hear different jokes  learn about others  values and priorities  We ve found it to be a valuable experiment   Billy  We use G Suite by Google for most of our internal written communications  be it spreadsheets  documents  or slides  There are a variety of chat channels  including one for each team for our daily chatter  But our open office floor plan is also very conducive to in person communication  We re lucky to have an open environment with plenty of different meeting spaces that allow for collaboration but within and across teams   For the product design team specifically  we re constantly sharing screenshots and recordings of our work  This continual feedback loop has proven very helpful in building and maintaining an open team culture  This sense of transparency drives home the notion that we re not competing against one another  but are rather all working towards the collective success of the team  To that end  we often celebrate together  grabbing drinks or dinner after work   What are the most important values you try to see reflected in your designs   Billy  Love  Family  Risk taking  We see our colleagues and customers as family we re all in this together and enjoy helping one another  Taking risks keeps us on our toes and motivates us all  Love helps eradicate pain  foster growth  and is downright beautiful   Danni  It s important to me that we ve taken some risks in the design  That what I m working on isn t a super obvious solution  it s had to get buy in from others   How does your team document collaboration   Danni  Our formal meetings are usually run by one person on the team who keeps a Google Doc and goes through the agenda to make notes of decisions made and what people are working on that week  That document will link out to supporting docs and who is responsible for specific tasks   In a casual environment  sometimes a quick photo of the whiteboard is enough to document what went on  In any case  we will usually follow up with an email to confirm what was discussed and follow up on any questions   What s the most powerful part of your design process   Danni  We always work really closely with engineering from the beginning  but one of the more powerful moments is when we prepare to release a new feature or product  Engineers and designers will sit together over a couple of days and work out all the final tweaks  We find bugs  we make last minute changes  we get things signed off  Proximity lets us focus and move quickly  Those last few days before a release are always pretty exciting   How do you hand off designs to developers   Danni  Our engineers have a really keen design sense  which I feel is quite unique to Squarespace  We re in constant conversation with each other  so there isn t really a culture of hand off  We work through problems side by side on a daily basis   We understand that it s important to develop the relationship between designer and engineer  Everyone has a style  and getting to know each others  is super valuable   I take time to observe and ask engineers how they prefer to collaborate  Lots of talking  No talking  Technical jargon  Prototyping on the fly  From there  we find a vibe that works for the two of us  I ask our engineers questions all day to see how they think  both as an engineer but also as a user  It s important to me that engineers know we can truly talk  and it s not always about sign offs and closing tickets   Can you talk a bit about Squarespace s branding and overall design   Billy  Once we shifted our brand imagery to showcase real customers and elevate their stories  it made a big difference  We found that having genuine customer stories as a foundation for our brand messaging is the most honest way for us to communicate our values and value proposition to the world   Danni  We put a lot of effort into our customer showcases  It s very cinematic  Comparatively  the design of our platform is intentionally toned down to let the customers  content and website be the focus   How do you know when you ve created a good experience   Billy  A good experience is an emotional response  so we typically know it s right when it simply feels good   Danni  It s generally a good sign when we re down to just tweaking styles  When you know the functionality is solid  and now you re just getting caught up in what level of opacity to use on a button   Is business strategy a design discipline   Billy  Both seek to solve a problem with deep thinking  data  intuition  new ideas  and testing  So  by that measure  design and business strategy are largely the same discipline   Related  Designers shouldn t code they should study business  Danni  Yes  you re working towards the same goal but with a different output   How do you use InVision as part of your design process   Danni  I use InVision to create rough click through prototypes to share with my team so we can iron out functionality  I love how I can share an InVision link with everyone once  and it ll keep updating as I make my edits   Our engineers have found InVision super valuable in that they don t have to download any individual comps or worry about whether they re looking at the latest version just refresh the online prototype   Once we have the final flow  I ll share it with our manager to get design specific feedback and ultimately a final sign off   How has your role as a designer changed since you first started  And where do you see things headed   Danni  I started in print and packaging design for physical products  Now  in a way  I do the same thing for digital products  Both require a similar type of logic and problem solving  and aim to help a user unpack and successfully use a product   I see design heading towards helping causes  Designers want to use their skills to help people in their daily lives  Eventually  I think that will align more and more with industries such as education  healthcare  agriculture  and the environment  That area of innovation is really exciting   Billy  When I first started designing  an identity system was about as holistic as a project would get  Now I m designing much more complex systems to support all different kinds of functions  sometimes end to end  that only deepens my love of holistic design   As for where design is headed  I think it s plausible though unfortunate that eye candy production will continue to rise  while hard issues remain ignored  As a society  we tend to struggle with helping our neighbor  We so often focus on ourselves  But what if we lived in a world where people voluntarily gave up their excesses to help others in need   My hope is that the future of design will be part of a massive team effort in which industries work together  collectively building a stronger  more sustainable global culture  I can t wait for our ever more digitally connected world to become truly connected  for everyone s benefit   What are 5 things you know now that you wish you knew when you first started out as a designer   Danni  Here are mine   Everyone has to do bread and butter work Give your manager positive feedback Parents will never really know what you do It s fair to negotiate your contracts No one s layer formatting is perfect  Billy   It takes a long time to build credibility  You likely won t land a dream project right out of school  Plan carefully  Curate your book  And do what it takes to pay the bills  Humility pays off  A collection of 5 really well designed typefaces is far better than a perfectly organized and tagged collection of 5 000 average ones  Moving faster in the early stages of a project leads to a better final product  Trying a ton of directions helps to uncover the best idea for you to refine  Relocating to a new city provides a whole new set of opportunities  It opens your mind  and helps you see in a new way  It s strangely difficult to sell someone on good design  I spent a lot of energy trying to convince potential clients they should hire a designer  when I should have sought out the people who were already interested in designing great things   Photos by Nina Robinson   Go inside design at more amazing companies,"[1173 523 8 879 1308 189 1251 862 1024 870 1290]"
1187,training-dataset/product/773.txt,product,Why the theory of dominant design matters for your product  an engineer s takeI need to find some underlying order in things  Lately  the thing keeping me awake at night have been tailfins  Tailfins don t make sense  Somewhere in the history of the American car industry  people started buying cars with things like tailfins that served no functional purpose and actually reduced speed due to increased drag   As an engineer this make no sense to me  Why did something that adds no real value make people buy more cars  What does this mean for the products we create and buy today  Should they all have tailfins too   The answer to these questions is related to the idea of dominant design   the idea that one product wins in every industry and becomes the de facto standard  But here s the kicker   the best design doesn t alway win   To an engineer this is like saying that gravity doesn t work in certain corners of this office       Understanding dominant design  Let s take Microsoft Windows  which became the dominant design in PC operating systems  Before Windows came along  there was no dominant design in the industry  and so there was really no clear way to compare products  Consumers didn t have a set framework in their heads about what an operating system should look like  It was all new to them   When consumers don t have a clear image in their mind of what the product should look like  it s difficult to differentiate between good and bad versions  As Steve Jobs famously said   People don t know what they want until you show it to them    It makes sense when you think about it  How can the  best  win if there is no standard to compare it to  For example  before a dominant design in the car industry emerged people had no idea what a standard car should look like  Once it got people from A to B better than a horse it was an improvement  Henry Ford didn t need the best engine or the fastest car  He needed a car that was good enough to be able to say it was better than a horse  The key here is that before a dominant design emerges  people are not comparing like for like   Good enough is not always enough  The problem is that when a dominant design becomes standardized  people are no longer comparing you to horses  People have a clear picture of what the product should look like and consumers need a way to differentiate between your product and the next  This is where branding and advertising comes in   In car advertisements up until the 1950s the manufacturers simply listed the cars many features  That is  until Harley Earl  one of the first car designers and head of design at General Motors realized that instead of making the car go faster they could simply make it look faster,"[1187 574 879 523 1024 438 1290 466 261 1109 172]"

different teams at Booking com get together in one of the meeting rooms in our Amsterdam office  furrow their brows  and drink phenomenal amounts of coffee  The meeting s purpose  To run a critical exploration of a presented design coming from one or two of our designers  discussing their work rigorously to explore what works  and what might be improved   This is the  Design Lab   and it is the essential critiquing phase of our design process at Booking com   The purpose of these sessions is to give thoughtful and actionable feedback  Design Lab helps designers seeking feedback to receive it in a focused way  providing them a clear path forward  From these sessions  designers uncover new insights that can help change the course of their design work in a meaningful fashion through a critical exploration of their work   At Booking com  we ve designed these critique sessions so that they tackle the following   Identify problems in our products and address these problems early on  well before it becomes too difficult to approach these problems in a different way  Provide designers with insights that can help them change the course of their design in a meaningful fashion  Provide support for each other across the entire Booking com design community  Improve the quality of our work over time through these sessions   In this article  I ll share how you can use our design critique method to achieve the same objectives in your design team or your own design work   Make your intention known  Start by sending out a message of your intention to run a design critique session to your colleagues  Our design community has an email list so we usually do this by sending out an email  If it is the first time you are going to have a critique session  it s important to include the following in your communication   What is a design critique  Why are design critiques important  What will you cover in the design critique session  What is the expected outcome   Design critiques are not limited to designers only  you could extend the invite to other relevant stakeholders  such as engineers  product managers  copywriters  etc   Key stakeholders  The key stakeholders in a design critique session are the presenter  the moderator  and the note master   The presenter  This is the designer offering up their work to be critiqued  They present the problem they are trying to solve  and their proposed design solution  The presenter should come with a clear vision of what they want feedback on   This is the designer offering up their work to be critiqued  They present the problem they are trying to solve  and their proposed design solution  The presenter should come with a clear vision of what they want feedback on  The moderator  This is usually  but not restricted to  a senior designer who is responsible for leading and driving the critique sessions  This role requires a deep understanding of UX methods  strategy  facilitation and negotiation  and is more about facilitation than dictation   This is usually  but not restricted to  a senior designer who is responsible for leading and driving the critique sessions  This role requires a deep understanding of UX methods  strategy  facilitation and negotiation  and is more about facilitation than dictation  The note master  Since the presenter should focus on the feedback and the conversation going on during the critique session  you need the note master  Their main role is to take notes on behalf of the presenter   Design critique is very much a collaborative effort and everyone should feel comfortable making sure that feedback is being given in the right way  and that the rules of engagement  see below  are followed  It s worthwhile to note that you don t want to leave it all up to the moderator to lead and facilitate  It s up to everyone in the design critique session to call each other out when they aren t giving the right feedback   Find the right space  Find a day that works well for you and your colleagues  Make sure there s at least 5  and not more than around 15  participants for a two hour critique session  Get a venue that can accommodate all the participants comfortably  We run our critique sessions for two hours and therefore we strive to have an ambience that allows for participants to be engaged with as few distractions as possible   On the day of the design critique  remember to throw in some snacks and refreshments   you want the participants attentive at all times  This helps minimise movement in and out of the room unless necessary   Rules of Engagement  We have guiding rules for our design critique sessions  We call them  rules of engagement   The rules of engagement should be shared well in advance  This prepares the participants  helps them get into the right mindset and helps manage expectations  These rules are carefully curated to enhance the smooth running of the design critique sessions and are designed to ensure we get the best out of all our time   Rules of engagement   Leave opinions at the door  we ll explain this below   Prescriptive solutions or ideas are avenues of thought  not direction to be taken by the designer offering up their work to be critiqued  All phones on silent mode  no laptops allowed  Candor is both welcomed and encouraged   Run the critique session  Before starting the session  everyone in the room should agree that they will not use their mobile phones or laptops during the critique session  They should commit to staying in the room for the entirety of the session  Listening  asking questions and concentration can not be accomplished if one is constantly distracted by checking your phone or replying to email  Keeping phones away and laptop closed provides a space for discussion and ensures focus in the room   The moderator then takes charge leading and driving the session  They start by reiterating the  rules of engagement  and stressing the importance of staying within the rules  Throughout the session  the moderator will make sure that all the participants adhere to the rules   but always remember that they  the moderator  is only there to help facilitate the session  not to dictate what comes out of it   The presenter then takes over  The main task of the presenter at this point is to present their work while touching these two main points   What  who  and why  What problem is the design trying to solve  Who is the target user  Why is it important to solve this problem for the user  Why is it important for the business to solve this problem   What problem is the design trying to solve  Who is the target user  Why is it important to solve this problem for the user  Why is it important for the business to solve this problem  Objective  This is a clear vision of what the presenter wants feedback on  Without a vision  everyone may be working from different assumptions and the session may turn into more of a brainstorm rather than a design critique  An example of a good objective  Obtain specific kinds of feedback from participants about a set of different design approaches for a feature area of your website   At the start of the critique session the presenter explains the problem they are trying to solve  their proposed design solution and what is it they need feedback on   The participants are then allowed to run a critical exploration of the presented design by asking questions  while strictly adhering to rule number one of engagement   leave opinions at the door   The intent of design critique sessions is discussion and exploration of the work presented  For this reason  we discourage opinions as they often close down discussion by limiting the presenter s responses instead of opening them up   Opinions include statements that start with  I don t think   or  I don t like   along with their counterparts   I think      I like     I feel      Here are some opinionated examples    I don t think you need that icon next to the second item on the left menu  or  That arrow icon on the   inbox  menu item does not look good  Use an envelope icon instead    On the other hand  we encourage open ended questions to open up exploration of design  Open ended questions provide the participants with an opportunity to gain insight on the design process and the thinking behind the design being presented   With this in mind  instead of saying    I don t think you need that icon next to the second item on the left menu   one could rephrase this    Can I ask why the icon is placed on the second item on the left menu    And instead of    That arrow down icon on the   inbox  menu item does not look good  Use an envelope icon instead   one should rephrase    Have you thought about using an envelope icon instead of the arrow down on the  inbox  menu item    During the critique session  it s best to encourage standing up  Also  participants should not be afraid of getting up close and personal with the work being presented   While the exploration goes on  the note master writes down all the points raised by the participants  They are allowed  where necessary  to ask for clarifications  Notes should be clear enough and easy to understand   At the end of the critique session  the presenter is given the final set of notes and returns to work with his team on moving the design forward   The note master s board  Notes should be legible  straight and to the point  Presenters may prefer to take a photo of the notes with them   Lastly  while exploration can often include offering up ways to solve a design problem  it s expected that all solutions will come from the presenter  since they are the one ultimately responsible for the work  Therefore  at the end of the critique session  all prescriptive solutions or ideas that lead to specific solutions will be taken only as avenues of thought  not direction to be taken by the designer offering up their work to be critiqued,"[1236 5 235 207 1251 862 506 523 8 1024 942]"
1250,training-dataset/product/544.txt,product,How to assemble your design sprint teamDesign sprints are reshaping how the most progressive companies build ideas into functioning products  Within a sprint  you ll pick a design challenge  sketch up solutions  vote on the best conceived solution  build a functional prototype based on your solution  and then test your prototype on live customers   Did I mention this all happens within 5 days   In this article  we re going to focus on 2 topics that ll help you prepare a team that can run a successful design sprint   Generating support from your company to conduct a sprint Putting the right sprint team together to execute  Engage your company  Once you ve decided that a design sprint will benefit your company  your next step is getting others around you committed  These people may include co founders  board members  designers  engineers  and marketers  They may be peers  managers  or junior members   Depending on outside pressure and your team s progress  getting everyone to agree to a design sprint may be the easiest decision you ve made since opening your doors  Or it may take some finessing in which case we ve laid out 3 options for rallying everyone together   Good news  We ve already tested and validated each of these options time and again  We ve also experimented with others  but none had as much success   Option 1  Distribute copies of the Sprint book and pitch it  Ask the team to read the book  Then break out Keynote  organize your compelling pitch about the benefits of a design sprint  and call a meeting   Note  For the ultra lazies  you can prompt your team to skip the book and review this Sprint Checklist  opens PDF    Pros   If they share your passion  they should be at least mildly stoked to give it a shot  This is about as low risk low cost as it gets  Cons   People are not to be trusted   people are lazy   people may not read the book or take you seriously  Your pitch bombs  people throw stuff at you  and you re never asked to participate in another sales call  Option 2  Run a one day sprint  With this approach you ll run a hyper condensed version of the design sprint in one business day   If we pretend the typical business day is a true 8 hours  you ll leave one hour first thing in the morning for the team to take care of their administrative duties and one hour for lunch  Use the other 6 hours to work through the sprint   Pros   This highly collaborative environment is contagious  Expect it to boost confidence and team dynamics   6 hours should be easy to sell  Cons   The abbreviated schedule could backfire if it s not laser focused  Consider bringing in some outside help  see option 3    Option 3  Get some outside help  The other options assume you have the team and chops to create your own momentum  However  some of you reading this may be a company of one  And some of you may simply not be up to the task  or you don t have the time to rouse the team   In these instances  consider bringing in some outsiders who have the experience required to get others excited and engaged   Pros   Outsiders with vetted experience tend to carry more influence  Pros who ve run many sprints will be able to better speak to the benefits  and challenges  and certainly they ll have more examples to share  Cons   Some companies prefer to keep everything locked down and in house  Options will be slim for finding good  experienced  trustworthy vendors  In the end  the goal is for you to get your existing team on board with a running a 5 day design sprint  Consider your team dynamics  roadmap  and pressures so you can get them over that hump with as little friction as possible  And if you discover a better option  please let us know   Your sprint team  Once your company is enacted to run a sprint  the next order of business is selecting and rallying your sprint team  You ll want to assemble a balanced team that can fully commit to the process  But you ll also need a good mix of personalities  skills  and disciplines   Google Ventures recommends a team no larger than 7  We agree otherwise  you go from managing a sprint to managing an unruly mob   Below are the 5 roles we ve found to be absolutely necessary in running a quality sprint   Product chief  aka the shot caller  This is the person with the most sway  and largest voting stickers   Though it s often the case  this won t always be the boss owner VP of product  In some cases we ve seen heads of customer service  lead engineers  and sales execs charter this role  What s most important is that this person has the most tangible exposure to the problem you re trying to solve   Customer rep  If your product chief doesn t have immersive  daily interaction with your customers  be sure to recruit this role onto your sprint team  They ll often be the ones to cut through the sales and marketing hype you ve tried ad nauseam  while pinpointing the precise issues your customers face   Designer  In another article we talked about creating Goldilocks quality prototypes  Having a designer involved in the sprint process is important because they can quickly make things look good enough   Engineer  While you don t need to be a technology company to run a sprint  the majority of prototypes you ll be testing will require some kind of engineering talent  The engineer on the team may produce software  hardware  or some other real world product prototype   Marketing  The words used to describe and market your product as well as the words within the product itself are just as important as the form and function of your prototype  Make sure someone is present who s blessed with the ability to effectively wordsmith   Bonus  Facilitator  There are a lot of moving parts to a design sprint  Don t forget that you have to book conference rooms  organize lunch  capture notes  set timers  interview customers  and keep the group on task  Designate one person on your sprint team as the facilitator their primary role is to ensure the team keeps up with the aggressive pace of a 5 day sprint   Summary  Design sprints require a commitment from your team  Once they re in  you ll want to mobilize a team that s willing to clear their schedules and charge through the sprint  And hopefully you now have the structure to accomplish those 2 objectives,"[1250 1012 942 971 948 665 399 1400

1251,training-dataset/product/1116.txt,product,3 lessons learned from leading design at a high growth startupA little over 2 years ago I joined Flexport  a global logistics company that employs people and software to manage the complexity of international trade  as the Lead Designer and one of the first full time employees in a small office in San Francisco s SoMa neighborhood  I remember how lucky I felt to be working with amazing people on the ambitious goal to design the new operating system for global trade  but there were some days when I wondered what the hell I had gotten myself into  I left a great job at a respected tech company in Silicon Valley to work on a moonshot   Since these early days  our growth has exploded  We now have offices across the world  Just in the last year we ve grown headcount by 5x  revenue by 10x  and onboarded more than 700 active clients  And we have a long way to go   I ve distilled the top 3 lessons I ve learned while leading design at Flexport  I hope this article will help designers in a similar situation survive the rollercoaster   1  Advocate design  Show the role of design  The role of design in business has become increasingly important over the last decade  but not everyone has kept up with the progress  There will always be colleagues that think design is the same as engineering  or believe that it just deals with aesthetics  The design leader must explain the business value of design and the complexity of the role it plays   At a high growth startup there isn t the structure or people in place for design to be understood  and the company landscape constantly changes  It s important that the business leaders understand the different ways design fits into the company   Help adjacent roles visualize the future  The best way to communicate the role of design is to learn adjacent skill sets  People often need to see something to understand it  and they interpret what they see through the lens of what they know  Designers have the unique ability to visualize the future  By learning complementing skill sets in business and technology  the designer develops a greater language that they can translate into visual form  This produces a vision for the future that others can understand   Show the process  The design leader must work to educate the team and new hires on how design functions within the startup  This can be as simple as sharing user interview insights  personas  journey maps  or wireframes with a new hire  This will give a glimpse of how design functions within the company   2  Include others  Talk to users  The most valuable thing a designer can do in the early days of a startup is to get out of the building and conduct user interviews  The designer should make sure to have a few open ended questions prepared  which will open up more questions  It s important that the designer interviews the user in the context in which they use the product  After the interview  the designer should observe how they work  This is always an eye opening experience  Look for ways that the user s workflows diverge from the product  and what other things they do to complete a job   Bring a diversity of roles into the design process  The second most valuable thing a designer can do is collaborate with different roles on the team  When multiple roles combine their expertise  they produce breakthrough ideas with the ability to execute  It is important that designers collaborate closely with business leaders  PMs  engineers  and subject matter experts early and often  Collaborators should generate ideas independently  then present them together  New possibilities will come out of the mix   Feedback loops get longer  The length of the feedback loop in a high growth startup should be much shorter than an established company because the team needs to maximize learnings  However  as the startup matures and gains product market fit  the problems get harder and the feedback loops often get longer  Features will require more input from others or less as structures mature and things become more complex   Clarify critique  People interpret things differently  When someone comments on a design  it could actually be about the content  This is why the designer must always clarify critique  People are also much better at identifying surface problems than understanding the root cause  People jump to solutions without evaluating the depth of the issue  It s the designer s job to re frame solution requests into problem statements   Everyone is a designer  It s the designer s role to listen to people s feedback and interpret what they say  They should include users in the design process to test  guide  and influence the final outcome  But not everyone can be included inevitably there will be people who react negatively to what gets built because they didn t feel like their voice was heard   Mind the  settle in  period  Users will often immediately reject a new design solely because it s different from what they were used to  This is especially true for startups that are reinventing an industry  Don t immediately react when users reject a new design unless it s preventing them from completing mission critical tasks  Wait for the new design to settle in  If the team addressed the root problem  most often a week will go by and the user will adapt  and completely forget the old design   3  Build systems  Document the organic process  Systems will form organically given that the right people are in the right role with the right amount of autonomy  The design leader must enable the shared documentation of the system by breaking it into its components and constantly trimming the fat   Lay an adaptable foundation  At a high growth startup there will inevitably be a lot of change to the business model  product  team  and user base  The design team has to constantly adjust and adapt their systems to accommodate this change  Things get messy and there s a lot of foundational work that needs to get done in order for great design to happen later on  The design leader needs to lay the foundation for good design to happen in a consistent way that adheres to design principles and patterns  as well as reflects the startup s brand values in a radically changing environment  It s painful and frustrating and it s the most important thing the design leader must do   Build a team  A systems approach should also be used to develop a team  Building a team is like fitting puzzle pieces together  Each designer should have complementary competencies  Some candidates are amazing visual designers  others are great user researchers  and some can translate a complex design into beautiful code  Some designers are outgoing and collaborative  and others are great at execution   In order to determine the qualities that the team needs in each hire  the designer s  should write down everything they do and categorize it under each competency  This list can then be used to inform hiring decisions and growth opportunities   Inevitably the lead designer will become more of a manager as the team gets bigger  As this happens they ll slowly delegate control of the design to the team  and work on maintaining the system   Build a design library  This process is similar for building design guidelines  Teams have to first build design before they standardize it  As the team works through iteration cycles  they should document components  patterns  and processes  as well as add them to a library for repeat use   Start with the basics  The design team should start with the basics when building systems  New possibilities will arise as the foundation is built  Projecting too far into the future will lead the team down the wrong path  Focusing on the problem is the way to the future   These are the lessons I ve learned while leading design at Flexport  Although these lessons are unique to my experience  I think they ll help designers at high growth startups manage the journey   This post was originally published on Medium   Keep reading about design leadership,"[1251 1024 261 8 523 879 862 870 1308 1173 475]"
1255,training-dataset/product/117.txt,product,Design how you designWhether you are a designer  engineer  or product manager  you have to work with others to iterate and execute  But if you have ever opened someone else s work  you know how hard it is to find the right file  page  group  artboard  or layer  If you are new to the field or new to a team  browsing to learn the history of a project is excruciating  Regardless of what you design  how you organize your output is just as important as the output itself  Unlike art  design must converge into group decision making  You need order at every stage to tame the inherent chaos of creativity and collaboration  To produce the best work  you must use semantic design versioning  Simple file versioning shows change but without context  When each canvas is a detached new  Copy   with labels like  Artboard 23 Copy Copy   it s difficult to compare with previous versions and relate to an overall system  Graphic design practices are simply inadequate for capturing the complexity of modern product design  Luckily  we can borrow ideas from other fields  The Dewey Decimal System  film clapperboard notation  and Git Semantic Versioning are systems well used to recording and classifying creative work  They share four principles that we can apply to versioning interaction design  division  meaning  order  and extensibility  At Intercom  semantic design versioning helps us index  evaluate  and share design ideas and options   leading to clearer choices and faster decisions  It also helps us examine experiences end to end and cover the fullest range of use cases and edge cases  While my own background is in design  you can apply the same principles to any discipline  Division   break it down with decimals  Whether you choose to use symbols or words  divide your versioning notation into smaller parts  narrowing it from general to specific  For example  during the refinement phase of a project  you expand on a single concept  Divisible versioning ensures you break down your problem into digestible parts and allows you to track how your solution holds up from beginning to end  Let s use an example from outside the tech world  Say you re a chocolate store owner  You need to design an experience for sampling chocolates   how people see their options and how they choose one  As you dive into the problem  your designs might look like this   If you have too many levels  you should break your problem into further projects  For example  designing an experience for sampling chocolate is only a much smaller part of designing your chocolate store  Meaning   is it a scene or a frame   Seeing versioning notation by itself  such as 1a A 1  is not informative  To make the version meaningful  you have to define each part of your notation  The first part could be the amount of time you ve spent on a project  design cycle or team sprint  or the type of project  product  feature  or customer   Successive parts may describe more specific variables to consider  For example  when exploring how people sample chocolates  you think about two purchasing groups  adults and kids  When you re ready to build  you refine your design so that it accommodates people who take one chocolate as well as those who break from the norm and ask for multiple  The meaning of each part of the notation may change as your problems change  but the systematic approach is the same   You can organize your folders and label your files according to a versioning system  For example  in a Sketch file  each design cycle can be a page  each path can be a group of artboards  and each step can be an artboard  Using a new Sketch page for each design cycle is a tactic for revisiting old problems with fresh eyes and hiding discarded ideas while leaving assets accessible  Order   branch and flow      Ordered notation tells people how to process your designs  When you differentiate between sequential steps and unordered  parallel alternatives with numbers and letters  you can compare versions quickly and make decisions faster  Let s say you come up with two directions for presenting sample chocolates  jars and trays  You want the experience to be great for both parties   adults and kids  Your designs might look like this   Small kids may have trouble reaching a countertop jar while their parents have no trouble  Everyone can reach chocolates from trays without issue  However  if you open an upscale chocolaterie  you need to maintain order and cleanliness  so keeping candy out of reach from kids is important  The alternatives then describe this choice  is your store a  family friendly and easygoing or b  exclusive and refined  You can arrange your Sketch artboards in a similar way  Create lettered alternatives from left to right and numbered steps from top to bottom  During exploration  a canvas is horizontally wide and vertically short  and you can zoom out to view the entire range of options  As you design  anticipate how to defend each version and extend the strongest concept with more steps to build its case  As you begin to refine  you can perfect every detail of an experience in series  If sampling chocolates from a jar  how do people 1  open the jar  2  fish the chocolate out  and 3  replace the lid  In my Sketch files  each group of sequenced artboards is vertical with variable width along the path  The deeper you go  the more you see how paths branch and merge  get wider and narrower   A section that is too wide indicates too many choices and an opportunity to simplify  Zoom out to see if new patterns emerge or deviate from the system,"[1255 261 207 879 1024 701 1251 5 475 523 149]"
1260,training-dataset/product/342.txt,product,Taking an invoicing application mobileLaunched in 2005  Blinksale is an invoicing application for freelancers and small businesses  Built exclusively for use in a desktop browser  the app had never worried itself over small screens  Mobile web browsing wasn t a common investment at the time especially for web apps and responsive design wouldn t develop until years later  But with the advent of the iPhone in 2007  the product landscape began shifting significantly and many web products began to go mobile   As smartphones increased in popularity  so did the requests for a native iOS app experience for Blinksale   In the fall of 2013  we were able to spin up a mobile initiative in order to support to the way our customers and prospective customers are now working   Initial research  The team began with high level discussions of what it thought the app should be  Should it only deal with invoices  or should it also handle estimates  client management  settings  and any number of other features  Should the invoice creation process on mobile be simplified  or should we include all its bells and whistles   There were a lot of questions and tough decisions  In the end  it didn t feel right to treat the mobile app as an abbreviated version of the web app  We wanted mobile users to feel like they had the whole app in the palm of their hand so that  if they wanted  they could be completely untethered from the web app   In the course of our product discussions  we started a list of core product features in a shared spreadsheet so that we could track the features we talked about  Now that we d decided that the app should include pretty much everything  we had to define  everything    That simple spreadsheet evolved into a detailed inventory as I documented every screen  element  feature  and action in Blinksale   Finding clarity  This was as much a discovery exercise as a documentation effort  None of us had been with the product since the beginning  and forcing ourselves to shine a light into all the corners of the app helped us get acquainted with parts that we hadn t necessarily paid attention to before   The end result was like one of those scenes in Iron Man where Tony Stark looks at an exploded holographic view of some piece of complex tech  It allowed us to see all of the pieces we were dealing with and how they connected to each other  We were able to have more specific and informed conversations about what should be  in  or  out  of the product  It also served as a map so we didn t forget any elements as we reconstructed screens and functionality in iOS   What we were able to see is that not every piece of functionality from the web app could or needed to move to iOS  For example  exporting a data table to an XLS file is not likely a relevant activity on a smartphone  but that is something that the web app can do  We decided that should not be a feature we pursue on mobile   Once we d tempered our understanding of what features should go into the app  I could more clearly explore design   From spreadsheet to screen  After pondering the spreadsheet  I decided to jump right into Photoshop to explore a few key screens  Playing is vital to the design process  but it often gets stamped out by the pressure to meet deadlines or jump right into agile development  I didn t want to leave it out  so I made sure that our schedule included time for this activity   I chose to play around with an invoice  in both read only and edit mode   and the invoices  list  screens  The invoice is the centerpiece of the app  and I suspected that solving design there would create a lot of patterns to be used elsewhere  And there are quite a few list screens within Blinksale  so figuring out that format could also assist design in other places   As a result of making screen designs that looked very real not sketches or other abstractions I think I arrived at solid design decisions much more quickly  When you have space to play  pressure releases and the mind has permission to wander  And when you go as high fidelity as possible  you avoid the pitfalls that lie between abstraction and reality   So as I played with these core screens  tangential design like primary navigation and other high level design patterns were also able to crystallize  The core aesthetic  color  fonts  etc   also materialized quickly  as I d been thinking about the next evolution of Blinksale s visual design for some time   Mapping the territory  With these structural and navigational ideas gaining more clarity  I decided to create a simple  app map  a visual representation of the screens I d need to organize and chain together  It helped me turn that very abstract spreadsheet into a high level screen diagram  This visual also helped me prove out my main navigation ideas and give the developer a clearer picture of how I was thinking about the app s structure   Have I mentioned that the development team was privy to all of this work and these product conversations  They were  Development was exposed to design work from the very start and validated or raised red flags if I started going down a path that was problematic  Design should never be isolated it rarely has all the answers   Designing for iOS  There s been a lot of talk about how Apple s influence may or may not be homogenizing user interface design  but I m not going to get into that  What I will say is that our product team didn t want Blinksale to simply pull in standard iOS UI elements and call it a day  We wanted to stand apart to some extent  Additionally  not all of Apple s default design choices agreed with me in the context of this app   But the great thing about a human interface guideline is that it s a guideline  Think something isn t quite right  It s your app and your design do something better   For example  I wanted to do something more interesting and flexible than iOS s standard text inputs  Other areas of the visual design were shaping up in such a way that this default element would look out of place  I also wanted to be able to make the UI more compact by putting 2 or more inputs side by side  and the default pattern made this difficult  if not impossible   I ended up using an input pattern that displays the input label by default  but then animates it to up above the input area once the user begins typing  This allowed us accommodate that compact layout goal and give the app a fresh  differentiated element   No operating system is going to hand over everything you need all of the time  It s okay to push the boundaries and create new things so long as you stay true to the overall spirit of the platform   Capturing interaction details  In completing the app design  I ended up creating mockups for nearly every screen  Remember that thing about high fidelity design  With every screen I mocked up  more reusable UI was created  It wasn t long before I was mostly dragging in elements from existing designs to create new ones   As I finished each screen  I placed them into a Keynote deck where I could annotate them  I find that the narrative style of walking through a screen or a workflow enlightens the developers on the intricacies of the interaction design and helps the designer detect gaps  inconsistencies  and flaws  Chaining together screens helped me see the  story  of the interactions unfold  like a comic book  I could more easily identify where the successes and breakdowns happen between screens  and what I need to think about as the user moved from one thing to the next   These days  InVision takes the place of my old Keynote workflow  It s easy to link up a bunch of screens with hotspots and guide the team through the specific click path with Tour Points  Dev Notes or Comments act as my annotations  And the screen level transitions mean I don t have to annotate how one screen animates to the next we can all just see it   Supporting development  Until this point  I d enjoyed a very necessary head start in front of development  I ve heard this approach referred to in industry lingo as  Sprint Zero   It gives the designer an important opportunity to get some design figured out up front before anyone starts building  Remember making time for play  There s that  and then there are a number of bigger design decisions that are better to make before getting into the wild seas of development   By coming to the table with at least a vision for how screens should chain together  the app map   how users would get around  Keynote walkthrough   and what major UI elements would look like  mockups   there was less risk of major rework as we built the product   Although we d determined that the app s feature set would be as close to the web app as possible  we still needed to define what we were going to launch as our first release it couldn t be everything  Plus  there was some foundational work to be done  like extending the application programming interface  API  to do things it hadn t been asked to do before  We also began writing stories and forming sprints   For the uninitiated  you can think of a story as a to do  and a sprint as a short period of time usually a couple of weeks to complete the to dos    For development  the nature of sprints acknowledges the impossibility of knowing with absolute certainty how long things will take to build  Design deserves the same treatment so that there s sufficient time to properly work out problems  This requires a team with shared goals  reasonable patience  and personal responsibility  Everyone is trusted not to waste time  but they re also expected not to rush out work that isn t their best   And  go   The majority of sprints came with a Test Flight update that we could all download and use  Having an actual app to tap around allowed development to point out holes or problems with the design as well as validate that everything was working as it should   Related  How we completed a 5 day design sprint in 3 days  Occasionally we ran across design needs that I d missed  Sometimes development was pretty confident in a solution and  in order to get a feature completed  they went ahead and implemented the idea  I can t recall us ever completely throwing out one of those solutions   On the contrary  they were so close to what I would have designed that we ended up collaborating to get them just a bit more polished  On a good team  everyone not just designers knows what great UX looks like   There were technical limitations  too  Sometimes we discovered that my designs weren t possible to implement or were unreasonably difficult  I had to accept these constraints and then fabricate a different way to solve the problem   It takes a village  It shouldn t be news to anyone that UX isn t just for designers  It never was  We ve been fortunate to build a team that cares about UX and supports it   We are more than our job titles  We didn t figure out every iota of the design in perfect detail before development  Animations were one place where I could count on the experience of our developers to make recommendations  Others on the team provided input that greatly improved the design of the app  Great design takes a village   One of the exciting and terrifying things about technology is that it s always changing  Today s solutions are tomorrow s laughably clunky user interface  Every day is a new opportunity to take a pass over what has shipped and consider what could be done to make it better   Onward,"[1260

1277,training-dataset/product/621.txt,product,Why developers should learn designIn 2003  I read a New York Times article that included this quote from Steve Jobs   It s not just what it looks like and feels like  Design is how it works    The significance of that statement completely changed my career as a developer   At the end of the day  I m the one who writes the code and builds the product with my own hands  How can it be that someone else determines how it ultimately works   The reality of every developer is that they re completely immersed in the back end  but they re never face to face with the end user  The user doesn t interact directly with their work the user interacts with what the designer creates   This difference in perspective keeps developers from seeing the whole picture  They re missing the most important part  the user   Developers  learning design makes it possible for you to assemble the entire system in your mind from how the user interacts with your product  down to the last link where you store the information in your database  This complete trajectory allows you to develop a product that s better than the competition   Related  6 tasty ways for designers and developers to collaborate better  I ve been a developer for over 15 years  and learning design has drastically improved my work  We constantly hear about how designers should learn to code  but I think that in order to create amazing products  developers should learn design   Understand design  understand the user  When I started learning design  one of my biggest  aha  moments was that even though I m working on the back end  what I do needs to make the user s life easier  Your users have real problems they re trying to solve  If you center your focus on solving the technical problems  that may keep you from coming anywhere near solving the problem   One of the best ways to make sure you re on the right track to serving the people who will actually use your product  Get involved early on in the design process preferably on day one  Being conscious of the user s problems from the start makes it easier to end up at the finish line without getting lost and doubling back   Paul Graham  the well known entrepreneur and founder of Y Combinator  said this   It sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist  And yet by far the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has    Not everything is as it seems  I ll say it again  It s pretty much impossible to go even a day without seeing someone share an article on whether designers should learn how to code   What people are forgetting  developers are capable of learning design and they should in order to collaborate better with designers and create truly amazing products   Unfortunately  there s a certain degree of rivalry between developers and designers  Who has the tougher job  who s right  who s wrong  who knows more the list goes on and on  and this refusal to play on the same team is getting us nowhere   Learn to design and you ll understand that a designer s job isn t as  easy  as it seems  Learn to code  and you ll realize developers aren t grumpy and out to ruin your designs  Designers and developers will come to value each other s work and respect what they do  which will lead to doing work together as a team   Enjoy your work more  For me  the best thing about learning design is that I now enjoy my work more   I m able to engage in productive conversations with designers by speaking their language  and that gives me a ton of satisfaction  Plus  when we launch a new project  I m even more passionate about it because my contribution goes beyond the technical aspects that happen behind the scenes   Learning design also helps developers create products that have a perfect balance between the creative and logical without a functional specifications document  It s possible to avoid the PSD and develop your designs and styles in an interactive way while writing the code   And when you find holes in the design decisions and the style sheets  you can solve them immediately and finish your work without any delays or headaches   Adapting  There s a constant flow of new devices being produced in all kinds of different shapes and sizes  So  the ability to adapt as quickly as possible is essential   Developers must work with a design that responds to these requirements  This means it s even more important that developers are able to spot these changes   How will a part of the design behave when you go from a desktop computer to a mobile phone  Or to a smart watch   With design knowledge  you ll probably take a much different approach to your work than you would have otherwise  giving you a huge competitive advantage and you ll more than likely save yourself and your team a ton of time   At my company  design and development constantly overlap  When a developer knows about design  the results are just better both in terms of work speed and the quality of what we produce   How I learned design  My first steps were with DesignLab  where a mentor helped me along the way  I also did the BLOC design program  Both were great  Obviously  nothing will replace constant practice seriously  practice every day or you ll never get better   A helpful resource on typography is Typography Workbook  A Real World Guide to Using Type in Graphic Design by Timothy Samara  To learn about color  texture  and images  check out Principles of Color Design  Designing with Electronic Color by Wucius Wong  And on form  spacing  and rhythm  I recommend The Principles of Design by Joshua David McClurg Genevese   You ll love these posts,"[1277 796 35 8 1024 523 1251 261 189 879 172]"
1290,training-dataset/product/280.txt,product,Valarie Hamm Carlson and Ian Collins  Design is not a departmentCan design make banking less awful  It s certainly working for Portland  Oregon based Simple  a technology company that s on a mission to help people feel confident with their money  Members of the InVision community  Simple defines their success by how happy their customers are   We sat down with Senior Brand Director Valarie Hamm Carlson and Creative Director Ian Collins to talk about collaboration  work life balance  and goofy office furniture   Tell us about Simple s design team structure   Ian  Val and I represent the creative collective at Simple  We have 2 distinct teams  the product design team and the brand studio team  that form one big  creative team  Together  we handle the visual and written expressions of the Simple brand   In Simple s early days  engineers became de facto designers  which meant that design was everyone s job  That shared sense of ownership naturally evolved into our current design structure  I m the Creative Director  but I also run the product design team  The brand studio is technically more on Val s side  but even saying things like  side  starts to feel like the opposite of what we re going for we want to be one big team within the company   How do you communicate with each other and how do you communicate with people on different teams   Valarie  We use Slack quite a bit  and one of the best things is just being able to say   Ian are you around  Can I hit you up and ask you about something  Where are you in our mega space   Then we find each other   Ian  We have an hour session every week where the entire team gets together  For the first 30 minutes  we share inspiration  For the second half  one person shares a particular design challenge they re facing  to get feedback from across the entire creative community here at Simple   It s a great way to eliminate the divide between teams and people  and to think about product design and other types of visual design   Something we found out right away  Conversations about something different are always the most engaging  For example  our copywriter joined one of our product design meetings and shared some of his work  Creative people are always fascinated by the inner workings of another creative process   What do you think it means to have a good work culture   Valarie  Alignment around the mission  and the intent of the company  That s how we attract a lot of talent people see what Simple stands for  both in terms of design and our point of view  and they re inspired  Not many people are inspired to go into the banking industry  but there s an impact to be made  And people who come here are totally game for the challenge of working in such a heavily regulated industry   Our mission is to help people feel confident with their money  We formalized our values last year around empathy  craft  efficacy  and curiosity  That plays a huge role in our design process and the type of copy we write  because we re constantly asking   How is the other person going to interpret this  Is it interesting  And does it feel human    What s a typical day at Simple like for you   Ian  I make myself available for anything especially when someone needs me to come over and give feedback  I also survey a lot of work that happens across the company and use InVision heavily to see what s going on   I have a lot of conversations about what s next  what s doing well at the moment  and what we re not doing well  I m spending a ton of time right now on figuring out process because the product design group is relatively new  We re figuring out how we can include more people and get more work done and how we can be more collaborative   Valarie  It s a combination of looking at the small details that have cumulative impact over time  and then the big picture vision  For example  Ian and I worked closely on the new space design and thought a lot about how our employees would live in this space   Can you share anything interesting that you learned about designing a good work environment   Ian  Functional chairs are a must   One of the big things we decided was no high concept furniture  Nobody actually wants to sit on a wobbly  goofy stool or in a hanging chair  It s uncomfortable   We wanted to stay true to the engineering driven culture we have here  We have good  functional  and beautiful stuff  but a couple pieces like the poofy ottomans in one room slipped by and that was a lesson learned  Don t try anything too different or cute or precious it might not be functional  Stick with what works   We set out to build a space that felt like home even down to the style of molding we used  We used the cheap wooden trim because it looks more like a home  The rugs and lighting throughout the office are all different  so it feels like you re in a living room   We just asked ourselves   Would you have this in your home   And if the answer is no  you should be really hesitant to have it in your office  Obviously things like whiteboards get a pass that s balancing that home like feel with functionality   Valarie  People don t want to work in a corporate headquarters   How do you hand off designs to the engineering team   Ian  We like to say that  design is not a department  meaning that everyone at the company is invested in design  Design is a collaborative process from the beginning  In the very early stages  we get the product designer  engineer  and product manager into a room and just start sketching out some ideas so we can determine our design goals   From there  we start designing and go from rough sketches directly into things that look like the real app  We don t focus so much on exact sizing and layout  We find that as opposed to do mockups  InVision prototypes get much more reactive feedback from folks during user studies  Engineers are able to visualize what things do and give solid feedback   How do you use InVision as part of your design process   Ian  Boards has been a critical tool for us  I create a lot of Boards because I work more on figuring out high level guiding principles and visions for projects  Boards are a great way to collect inspiration and get an idea of where we re trying to go without having any of us do much design work in advance   Valarie  InVision helps our design strategy come to life  Plus  it s great as an engagement tool to make sure everybody s on the same page   What do you do when you re having a hard time focusing   Valarie  Sometimes when you ve been at something for too long and nothing is working  you have to put it back in the corner and take a break  Another thing to try  Turn the challenge over to someone else  They ll likely have a unique perspective and approach that ll help you see things a different way   Ian  A long walk can do wonders   What have you worked on at Simple that you re most proud of   Valarie  For me  it s not a project it s how strong our team is and the fact that people want to work here   Ian  I love that we ve created that sense that design is everyone s responsibility here   Valarie  Even our finance team  when they were designing an internal budget management tool  wanted it designed well and beautiful for internal clients  People here are proud to be advocates for good design   How do you make sure everybody on your team has a good work life balance   Ian  It always comes down to culture  What are the norms and what is expected  I spent the first 7 or so years of my career in San Francisco working at startups  I worked at some places that were good  and I worked at some places where you were almost a pariah if you left at 5 because they gave you free dinner   At first the free dinner was at 5 30  but then by the time I left  it wasn t happening until 7 30  It was also a culture where everybody stayed late because we were all single white males  That was tough  I didn t like that balance   Moving to Portland has helped a lot  The culture here is much more around family building and work life balance  During our weekly all hands meetings on Fridays  we ve had sessions where we talk about a particular engineer who gets a lot of amazing work done  What we ve pointed out specifically is that this person comes in at 9 and leaves at 5 every day and he doesn t work on weekends or evenings because he has 2 kids  It s important to set the example so others feel more comfortable doing it   Valarie  Though we ve designed a beautiful workspace and we want everyone to feel comfortable here  people are welcome to go home or work from a coffee shop if they d like   It s not about where you should be  but more about what you need right now to do your best work   Do you have any advice for young designers   Valarie  Always keep your audience first they should be your muse  Our best work is beautiful and smart but also meaningful and useful to the people who are consuming the content  That s the magical combo   As a young creative  there s a tendency to measure yourself on getting a concept right the first time around  The process of gathering feedback and how you respond to that input is a better indicator of talent and your ability to hone your craft   Find things that seem boring and challenge yourself to make them interesting  Those are some of the opportunities where you can make the greatest difference   Use InVision and start designing like Simple,"[1290 879 523 1173 8 189 1308 1251 862 1024 5]"
1308,training-dataset/product/337.txt,product,Questions  and Answers  from Design Interviews at FacebookWhat does your day look like   Schedule wise  I get in fairly early  usually shortly after 8am  I m able to leave when I see fit  usually between 4 and 5pm  I used to be rigid about refusing to work on my  off  time   past experiences have compelled me to value and protect personal time   but now I m comfortable going home and finishing up a thing or two in the evening if needed or prepping for the week on a Sunday   It s up to each individual to decide what they need to invest to be successful in their role   Each day has a completely different flow  Often my calendar is packed  I call those days  all day meeting days   and I relax into that  This means I have product team meetings  design meetings  check ins with cross functional partners  1 1s with mentees  design critiques  working sessions  interviews  etc  I might also attend one of our hosted events like our Facebook Design Lecture Series  our weekly Q A where Mark answers employee questions  or informational talks on developing products  Sometimes I squeeze in an onsite chiropractor appointment or go to the gym   We have an informal policy of  no meeting Wednesdays  where people in many roles are able to work remotely  often from home  At bare minimum those days are fully open for productivity  These are an essential complement to the rest of my week   Ultimately  you re in control of your own schedule  and it s up to you to own both working time and non working time  You make sure the flow of each day works for what you need to accomplish both short and long term  personally and professionally   How do you decide who works on what   I like to think that we re very thoughtful about who joins what team  It s not an exact science  but there are some clear facets   Our group of Facebook products and Facebook itself span a lot of territory from consumer products to business tools  from complex systems to independent experiences  We have products and projects that rely heavily on strategy and product thinking  and we also have those that have bigger needs in interaction and visual design  The recruiting and interview process helps determine what products might be a good match for each new designer  At times we ll hire people who are strong in a very specific area because we already have an open role in mind for them   While we expect Product Designers to have a range of skills  it s not an expectation that everyone is an expert at everything  This is where matching comes in   Before you re even hired  we do our best to match what you re good at  what you enjoy doing  and where you ll grow the most with an available and supportive team   That might mean if you have experience designing systems  we d want to look at teams with projects that have lots of complex dependencies  If you re a junior designer  it s important for us to consider teams that have solid mentors  If you re passionate about a certain problem space  we might want to consider a team with that sort of content area   It s not a perfect system  but setting both you and your product team up for success means there s a mutually beneficial partnership  and that s the sort of match we strive to make   What s one thing you love and one thing you hate   What I love most is that I ve been able to get an enormous range of experience at one job  and that I have been in direct control of that path   I ve worked on three teams over my three years at the company  Payments   specifically Payments in Messenger   and simultaneously designed the first launch of Safety Check  I worked on Privacy for nearly a year  and I started on Facebook s K12 Initiative at the beginning of this year  These teams have all had products and features focused around my areas of interest  complex problems faced by people using Facebook  often dealing with a common thread of trust   The immense growth over the course of my time with these teams wouldn t have been possible without the freedom to raise my hand and take action when it was time to move on   I ve been committed to and invested in each team  but I m grateful to be able to ask for a new challenge or new environment when I need one and be able to find a good match   As for the worst part of the job  for me  it s the commute  I live in San Francisco  and the travel to Menlo Park is grueling  However  it s a tradeoff  and I still keep coming in every day knowing there s nowhere I d rather be   I m fortunate not to get motion sickness  and I can get plenty done on our shuttles  It s not difficult to be productive and get things done like emails  reviewing decks  doing audits or research with shuttle amenities like wi fi  Many people sleep or listen to music or podcasts  I count commute time as work time  it is time that I do not have to myself  The time between home and work and vice versa are dependable ramping up and coming down periods  and personally  I value the time to switch gears   I d still rather have this job without the commute  but all of the other things I get from this job   not just the perks and benefits  but the growth and the ability to have impact keep this tradeoff in balance   How do you work with engineers   For me  it s been crucial to consider developers as my design partners  We work in a fast paced environment  and products are often designed and built simultaneously  we don t work in silos  Rarely is there a formal hand off of final designs and specs to a developer team  The best teams work collaboratively  We sometimes might have entirely different skillsets  but they re always complementary  Often  we have overlapping expertise and interests   I do my best to bring my engineers in early in my design process so that they can share ideas  feedback and constraints with me   Likewise  I want to be involved in the development process so I can connect research and share the intentionality behind design decisions  and ultimately help the product get to the best state possible   I host weekly design eng syncs at the beginning of every week  I share early work  and my eng teammates share what they re working on   all in the name of collaboration  I also utilize groups or chat threads or simply chat in person to share on the fly   It s up to you to build those partnerships with your engineering team  working closely together builds strong products   What s the design culture like   We are invested in our design teams and the design community  We value inspiration  connection  and innovation   Our design team hosts the Facebook Design Lecture Series where we bring in speakers from diverse perspectives that aim to inspire  elevate  provoke  and educate our entire Facebook community  We host our Artist in Residence program in which we bring in artists and designers to create installations in our workspaces  Our Analog Research Lab offers poster making  screenprinting and woodworking  and they brings in external classes like TypeCamp  We have meetups like Draw Club  where anyone can come in and join an informal drawing class  We have quarterly hackathons a permanent part of our product and design culture where anyone can bring an idea to life and propose it in a few short days  We invest in building and teaching designers the best tools for the job like Sketch  Origami  and Framer   Our resources have grown as our team has grown  Facebook s Product Design team has changed substantially since I started three years ago  we ve scaled to nearly 10 times our size   Growth changes things  from operations to how we connect   We used to have a volunteer team that worked on our interface guidelines comprised of a handful of people  Component questions or proposals would sometimes go through that group or often be resolved or implemented independently  We now have a fully functioning and comprehensive Interfaces team  which is ensuring quality  consistency and innovation in our standards   There s been some downsides as we scale  For a while  I hosted an intro session for my team in Design Camp   a three week training course for new design hires   and I had the opportunity to meet everyone that came through the door  Once I passed that role on to someone else  I no longer was guaranteed an introduction to everyone  I miss that  but even with that touchpoint it still would be difficult to maintain genuine connections with every incoming designer   We still try to stay connected  We have events and offsites for both our entire design organization and our product teams  We ve been to beach parties  visited goat farms  taken cooking classes  gone bowling  attempted glassblowing and gone kayaking  We ve done metal smithing  hung out on boats  taken mixology classes and baked croissants  We ve had countless dinners together as a design family   To keep abreast of current design work  we have quarterly all hands meetings with our entire design organization and regular monthly meetings for the our smaller teams  Our direct teams have weekly critiques  which allow us to share work with designers we interface with regularly and get continued feedback   Everyone sits with fellow designers  We don t  however  have our own floor or exclusive design space  I ve twice in my career been the lone designer working on a product  I was still included in a team of closely related products so that we all could have support and camaraderie  Every design team also sits in close proximity to their respective product teams  Being at the cross section of both design and cross functional partners allows us to closely collaborate with every teammate  and in a way  that keeps us feeling small and connected  almost like a start up   I find this fascinating  that through the massive growth we ve had  we continue to work in a scrappy yet connected manner  If you were ever to join our design family  I m sure you d be pleasantly surprised too,"[1308 1024 8 1173 1251 879 261 870 523 862 701]"
1342,training-dataset/product/1209.txt,product,Lessons learned from running a design sprint with an ed tech startupAt New Haircut  we recently did a design sprint with LRN  an education startup that developed an adaptive learning platform  Adaptive learning is the use of automated teaching to  adapt  the educational content to each student s needs and abilities  Some consider it  the most ground breaking tech innovation  in education   The problem  LRN started building an adaptive learning platform back in 2015  Their goal was to improve the educational experience for everyone  students  teachers  and parents  Its founders had decades of experience in education systems  artificial intelligence  game theory  and intelligent tutoring systems that s pretty much every tool in the toolbox one needs when building such a platform   But having a great product idea and the technical expertise is not enough to keep you out of trouble  After 12 months  LRN came to a standstill  The developer they hired built the wrong product  This caused spirited debates among the founders and inaction for fear of yet another failure  They weren t wrong to have these fears  15  of bootstrapped startups fail because they hire inexperienced people   The process  We use GV design sprints to take on big challenges  so I immediately knew LRN was a great candidate for such a sprint  A sprint works like  a superpower  by helping companies get customer feedback on their product in only 5 days  They needed to define their product  and there was no more time to waste   Day 1  Understanding the issue  On the first day of the sprint  our 6 person team gathered information about the problem at hand and spoke to experts  Then we began mapping the challenge on a whiteboard  The rules of the sprint state that you have to pick a manageable piece of the problem that can be solved in one week  It s tricky because everything on the whiteboard seems to scream back at you   Pick me    LRN s platform served several user groups  students  teachers  school districts  They all had different needs and pain points  But we could not tackle everything in 5 days  The first step was choosing one customer and one problem   We knew parents enrolled their kids in private schools because teachers there could dedicate more attention to each kid  Our assumption was teachers could do that because classes in private schools were smaller   Let s focus on teachers   said Malcolm  one of the LRN founders   Now  reducing the size of a class wasn t something an adaptive platform could do  But freeing up class time was possible  Teachers could use the platform to build personalized lessons  This way  they d spend less time transmitting knowledge and more time guiding students through that knowledge   Our design sprint goal was to understand how a technology platform could help teachers build personalized lessons fast   Day 2  Sketching solutions  Day 2 was all about visualizing solutions  Everyone on the team sketched even those reluctant to do so  The experts we spoke to on Monday pointed out that student reports would help teachers tailor educational content  so many of the solutions we sketched included student performance reports  Even so  they were wildly different from one another  which is the whole point of the exercise  A sprint should unearth a wide range of solutions   Day 3  Choosing a solution  If the second day of the sprint is about finding a million ways to solve your problem  the third day is about turning those into a million dollar idea  In our case  the official sprint deciders picked a solution that showed how the LRN platform could aggregate student performance data into individual and class reports  To be fair  it wasn t  and it never is  just one solution  but rather scenes from several sketches linked together  The one pitfall of our winning solution was that LRN lacked the specific information about student learning goals and metrics  But we had an idea   Day 4  Prototyping our solution  On Thursday morning  we put the prototyping on hold and scheduled a few extra interviews with experts  Deviating from the sprint schedule was a calculated but risky move  Our hope was that a second  and more targeted  foray into the minds of the experts would shed some light on the goals and metrics section  Try to stick to the rules if this is your first sprint   When the interviews were done  we used InVision to start working on a prototype  The prototype was rather complex for a design sprint  It had 5 sections  Welcome  Dashboard  Goal Library  Learning Sessions  and Reports   Day 5  Testing our prototype with real users  Given our attempt to screen more experts on Thursday  we were up against our deadline to complete the prototype in time for customer testing  In fact  we finalized it minutes before the first tester arrived   A few patterns emerged by the end of the day  Teachers found the personalized learning sessions module to be confusing and time consuming  We expected this since we missed key data in the goals and metrics section  And yet  they were receptive to the student and class reports  They believed such reports would allow teachers to take specific actions while the lessons were still underway   We were able to test our hypothesis that reports were key in helping teachers build personalized lessons  We were not able to vet the goals or measure and confirm which students skills are important  But that would be open game for an upcoming sprint   Takeaways  So did we know exactly what a successful adaptive platform should look like  Not yet  But the sprint helped us get closer  There s more work to be done at least one more sprint is required to confirm the goals and metrics section as well as our final MVP approach  But after just one intense week  we were ready to define LRN s 6 month product roadmap   Before the sprint  the LRN founders were stuck  They lost time and money building a learning management system  It was a product that wasn t solving a market need or highlighting their strategic point of view  Their stress levels were through the roof  During the sprint  they had to let go of their differences and unrealistic goals  prototype a viable solution and test it with users   The design partners at GV warn that sprints only work if you begin with the right foundation  While we adhere to this gospel  the LRN sprint showed us that even when you start with a somewhat shaky foundation  a sprint is incredibly valuable   Read more about design sprints,"[1342 942 1012 971 1250 948

1394,training-dataset/product/938.txt,product,Designers share their New Year s design resolutionsAs we  perhaps enthusiastically  prepare to bid farewell to a tumultuous 2016  it s only natural to start thinking about the things we want to accomplish in 2017   In an exciting and ever evolving industry  the possibilities for better  great design seem limitless  We reached out to the InVision community to learn what design resolutions our friends had for 2017  and let me tell you  I m feeling pretty inspired    For me  it s to focus on writing and publishing more of my work  I ve fallen into a trap of being heads down and doing work but not talking about or sharing it  Writing is one of the best ways for a designer to think through what they have done and what they will do  It s a great way to teach others about how I work and open myself up for critique     Kyle Fiedler  Chief Design Officer at Thoughtbot   I m in charge of marketing for our organization  My 2017 design

words   It all starts with writing   I ve been in the shadow for too long     Marc Olivier Lapierre  UX Designer at Valtech Canada   In 2017 I want to make stream of consciousness  high level sketching a central part of my process  I currently spend a good bit of time thinking about ideas and jotting down notes  then I sketch out the top few I think are most applicable  I just attended a fantastic session by Eli Woolery on quick ways you can flex your design thinking muscles during your everyday workflow  and I was very inspired  Sketching the first 6 ideas that come to mind  even if they seem ridiculous at first  can really shift your thinking about how to solve a problem to a more innovative place     Jennifer Aldrich  UX and Content Strategist at InVision  Related  What are

1400,training-dataset/product/1213.txt,product,How to get business value from a design sprintGoogle Ventures  model for design sprints is something many of us are now familiar with   The idea is that a team spends 5 days tackling a specific customer problem  This process helps the team quickly test their hypotheses and learn from real customers   GV s process is well documented  It s also tried and tested across various industries   Here s a high level view of how that process works over 5 days   Monday  Map Tuesday  Sketch Wednesday  Decide Thursday  Prototype Friday  Test  There s no doubt this model is working for some  Yet because I ve been running these types of sprints for a while  I m often asked   How is it possible to get business value from this in just 5 days    This question usually comes from business stakeholders  It s also something the team conducting the design sprint should factor into their thinking and activities   I ve pondered how best to answer this question for a while  Our team has tried and tested a lot of tweaks to the process along the way  Through our testing  we ve come up with some answers   The purpose of this article is to provide you with 3 new activities  These can be included in your existing design sprint process  By including these steps in our team s process  we increased engagement across the business  We ve also deepened our shared understanding   Our design sprints now answer that question  By adding these 3 activities  yours can too   Here s what we ve added   New activity 1  Define the Job to be Done  If you aren t familiar with the Jobs to be Done technique  it s well worth understanding  Over the past few years  this has become one of the most useful techniques we apply daily   The Job to be Done is the higher purpose that motivates someone to hire your product or service   As an example  let s say it s a Sunday afternoon and you re bored  You might choose to hire Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as a solution to your boredom  That s one option  But  you could also hire the gym  the pub  Netflix  a book  or Instagram for the same job  All these solutions would solve your boredom problem   This is an interesting insight  The cinema likely thinks they re competing with other nearby cinemas  This may be true  but it does not tell the entire story   When companies understand the Job to be Done  the right solutions are easier to define  The competition becomes clearer  It s also simpler to target the most effective channels to reach the right customers at the right time   A great example of this is the now famous milkshake example   We include this activity in our refined sprint process on a Monday afternoon  We keep it simple and focus on mapping out only the customer jobs that we believe are directly related to the focus of the sprint   This output ends up looking something a little like this   To communicate this  we use Job Stories   Job Stories are effective because they help us understand causality  They also don t assume what the solution should be  This is important because we don t yet have a solution to the problem we re working on   Here s an example   Job Story  When I m with friends at a party  and Coachella is the topic of conversation  my best friend and I make the snap decision to commit to going next year  When we do  we need to figure out how we re going to make it all happen so that we can actually get there and have the best time of our lives   In summary  job mapping helps set the context for our design sprint  Job mapping helps build empathy  We also start learning about the potential business value much earlier in the design process   This leads us to our next addition in our design sprint process   New activity 2  Assess the desirability  viability  and feasibility  Great value propositions are balanced  They have to be desirable to people  They must be commercially viable for the businesses delivering them  To make that happen  they must also be technically and legislatively feasible   This balance is important to our team  Because of this we add a basic desirability  viability  and feasibility  DVF  assessment to our design sprints   This is an effective technique to help build shared understanding with business stakeholders  It helps engage them in the process and the culture of design sprints   If you haven t conducted a DVF assessment before  here s the basic framework to get you started   Map the criteria for each category  List 3 columns with the headings Desirability  Viability  and Feasibility  Then  list the considerations for each category   It could end up looking as simple as this   Assign a score to each of the criteria  Using a scoring criteria of 0 10  assign a score to each of the criteria   0   Terrible  5   Average  10   Perfect  This is a great opportunity to leverage the knowledge of the stakeholders involved in the sprint  You ll hopefully gain insights from engineering  marketing  sales and biz dev  customer support and legal   The result ends up looking something like this   Average the results and define a score  Sum the total in each category  and divide it by the total number of considerations   You ll end up with totals that looks something like this   You can now use these scores to help understand what s missing  From here  you can work on opportunities for improvement   Make the results easy to understand  For the results of this activity to be meaningful  they need to be understood by the people involved in the sprint   For our team  a Venn diagram does the trick  We then add a few notes and a key to help make the visualization easier to interpret   The result looks something like this   We then make sure this is available so it can be referenced during the sprint  Printing it out and sticking it on the wall should be good enough   A little tip that our team has found useful is to always make sure you have version control  Just like a business model canvas  a spreadsheet  or your wires  this will evolve over time   There s no fixed position the DVF assessment should take in your sprint  Depending on stakeholder availability  our team has found the end of day 1  or the middle of ay 3 to be the best slot   This works for us  It s important to find what works best for you   There s one final activity we add to our sprints  In some ways  this is the most helpful activity for our business colleagues   New activity 3  Define the metrics that matter  For our team  business metrics need to be tied to all design efforts  We ve found this helpful in design reviews  prioritization activities  and design sprints   Related  Designers shouldn t code they should study business  As part of our design sprint process  we tend to frame these metrics with hypotheses  Until we start testing with our customers  we know very little   Our team has found the end of day 3 or start of day 4 to be the best place for this activity  We work collaboratively to define clear and testable hypotheses  Each of these are associated with the solutions we re planning on testing during day 5 of the sprint   Sometimes these are quite specific to the sprint  These types of hypotheses help inform how we will conduct our research  Other times we make them bigger picture  These bigger picture hypotheses help us have meaningful conversations with the business about strategy and roadmap   This is the basic template we use to document these hypotheses and metrics   Inferential analysis  Detail what has led you to believe what you believe  What data or observation are you drawing this inference from   Business value  Detail the tangible business value this is expected to create if the hypothesis is proven   By defining these hypotheses clearly  our team is better placed to plan our user research approach  In these sessions with customers  we usually focus on the efficacy of the solution we ve designed  If time permits  we add contextual inquiry to help deepen our understanding of hypothetical constructs like attitudes   This is what works for us   Design is a systematic process that guides our attempts to solve complex human problems  Design sprints help make these efforts effective   For these efforts to be most effective  design sprints can t be focused solely on the customer  They need to also focus on business value   Add these 3 activities to your design sprints  You ll be better positioned to answer that tricky question   How can we derive business value from this in just 5 days    You ll also start shipping products that are more refined and better balanced,"[1400 942 971 948 665 1250 1012 566 1098 242 523]"
