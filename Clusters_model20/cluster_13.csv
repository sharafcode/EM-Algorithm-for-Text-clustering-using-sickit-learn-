1,training-dataset/business/747.txt,business,On the Road to Recap Why the Unicorn Financing Market Just Became Dangerous For All Involved  In February of last year  Fortune magazine writers Erin Griffith and Dan Primack declared 2015  The Age of the Unicorns  noting    Fortune counts more than 80 startups that have been valued at  1 billion or more by venture capitalists   By January of 2016  that number had ballooned to 229  One key to this population growth has been the remarkable ease of the Unicorn fundraising process  Pick a new valuation well above your last one  put together a presentation deck  solicit offers  and watch the hundreds of million of dollars flow into your bank account  Twelve to eighteen months later  you hit the road and do it again   super simple   While not obvious on the surface  there has been a fundamental sea change in the investment community that has made the incremental Unicorn investment a substantially more dangerous and complicated practice  All Unicorn participants   founders  company employees  venture investors and their limited partners  LPs    are seeing their fortunes put at risk from the very nature of the Unicorn phenomenon itself  The pressures of lofty paper valuations  massive burn rates  and the subsequent need for more cash   and unprecedented low levels of IPOs and M A  have created a complex and unique circumstance that many Unicorn CEOs and investors are ill prepared to navigate   Many have noted that the aggregate shareholder value created by all of the Unicorns will vastly overshadow the losses from the inevitable failed unicorns  This likely truism is driven by the clear success of this generation s transformational companies  AirBNB  Slack  Snapchat  Uber  etc   While this could provide some sense of comfort  most are not exposed to a Unicorn basket  and there is no index you can buy  Rather  most participants in the ecosystem have exposure to and responsibility for specific company performance  which is exactly why the changing landscape is important to understand   Perhaps the seminal bubble popping event was John Carreyrou s October 16th investigative analysis of Theranos in the Wall Street Journal  John was the first to uncover that just because a company can raise money from a handful of investors at a very high price  it does not guarantee  i  everything is going well at the company  or  ii  those shares are permanently worth the last round valuation  Ironically  Carreyrou is not a Silicon Valley focused reporter  and the success of the piece served as a wake up call for other journalists who may have been struck by Unicorn fever  Next came Rolfe Winkler s deep dive  Highly Valued Startup Zenefits Runs Into Turbulence   We should expect more of these in the future   In late 2015  many public technology companies saw a significant retrenchment in their share prices primarily as a result of a reduction in valuation multiples  A high performing  high growth SAAS company that may have been worth 10 or more times revenue was suddenly worth 4 7 times revenue  The same thing happened to many Internet stocks  These broad based multiple contractions have an immediate impact on what investors are willing to pay for the more mature private companies   Late 2015 also brought the arrival of  mutual fund markdowns   Many Unicorns had taken private fundraising dollars from mutual funds  These mutual funds  mark to market  every day  and fund managers are compensated periodically on this performance  As a result  most firms have independent internal groups that periodically analyze valuations  With the public markets down  these groups began writing down Unicorn valuations  Once more  the fantasy began to come apart  The last round is not the permanent price  and being private does not mean you get a free pass on scrutiny   At the same time  we also started to see an increase in startup failure  In addition to high profile companies like Fab com  Quirky  Homejoy  and Secret  numerous other VC backed companies began to shut their doors  There were in fact so many that CB Insights started a list  Layoffs have also become more prevalent  Mixpanel  Jawbone  Twitter  HotelTonight and many others made the tough decision to reduce headcount in an attempt to lower expenses  and presumably burn rate   Many modern entrepreneurs have limited exposure to the notion of failure or layoffs because it has been so long since these things were common in the industry   By the first quarter of 2016  the late stage financing market had changed materially  Investors were becoming nervous and were no longer willing to underwrite new Unicorn level financings at the drop of a hat  Moreover  once high flying startups began to struggle on the fundraising trail  In Silicon Valley boardrooms  where  growth at all costs  had been the mantra for many years  people began to imagine a world where the cost of capital could rise dramatically  and profits could come back in vogue  Anxiety slowly crept into everyone s world   About this same point in time  the journalists that focus specifically on the venture capital industry noted something quite profound  In 1999  record valuations coexisted with record IPOs and shareholder liquidity  2015 was the exact opposite  Record private Unicorn valuations were offset by increasingly fewer and fewer IPOs  If 1999 was a wet  read liquid  bubble  2015 was a particularly dry one  Everyone was successful on paper  but in terms of real cash on cash returns  there was little to show  In Q1 of 2016 there were zero VC backed technology IPOs  Less than one year since declaring it the  Age of the Unicorns   Fortune Magazine was back with a dire warning   Silicon Valley s  585 Billion Problem  Good Luck Getting Out    As we move forward  it is important for all players in the ecosystem to realize that the game has changed  Equally important  each player must understand how the new rules apply to them specifically  We will start by highlighting several emotional biases that can irrationally impact everyone s decision making process  Next we will highlight the new player in the ecosystem that is poised to take advantage of these aforementioned changes and emerging biases  Lastly  we will then walk through each player in the ecosystem and what they should consider as they navigate this brave new world   Emotional Biases  When academicians study markets  one common assumption is that the market participants will act in a rational way  But what if the participants are in a position that leads them to non optimal and potentially irrational behavior  Many biases bring irrationality to the Unicorn fundraising environment   Founder CEO   Many Unicorn founders and CEOs have never experienced a difficult fundraising environment   they have only known success  Also  they have a strong belief that any sign of weakness  such as a down round  will have a catastrophic impact on their culture  hiring process  and ability to retain employees  Their own ego is also a factor   will a down round signal weakness  It might be hard to imagine the level of fear and anxiety that can creep into a formerly confident mind in a transitional moment like this  Investors   The typical 2016 VC investor is also subject to emotional bias  They are likely sitting on amazing paper based gains that have already been recorded as a success by their own investors   the LPs  Anything that hints of a down round brings questions about the success metrics that have already been  booked   Furthermore  an abundance of such write downs could impede their ability to raise their next fund  So an anxious investor might have multiple incentives to protect appearances   to do anything they can to prevent a down round  Anyone that has already  banked  their return   Whether you are a founder  executive  seed investor  VC  or late stage investor  there is a chance that you have taken the last round valuation and multiplied it by your ownership position and told yourself that you are worth this amount  It is simple human nature that if you have done this mental exercise and convinced yourself of a foregone conclusion  you will have difficulty rationalizing a down round investment  A race for the exits   As fear of downward price movement takes hold  some players in the ecosystem will attempt a brisk and desperate grab at immediate liquidity  placing their own interests at the front of the line  This happens in every market transition  and can create quite a bit of tension between the different constituents in each company  We have already seen examples of founders and management obtaining liquidity in front of investors  And there are also modern examples of investors beating the founders and employees out the door  Obviously  simultaneous liquidity is the most appropriate choice  however  fear of price deterioration as well as lengthened liquidity timing can cause parties on both sides to take a  me first  perspective   The Sharks Arrive With Dirty Term Sheets  Who are the Sharks  These are sophisticated and opportunistic investors that instinctively understand the aforementioned biases of the participants and know exactly how to craft investments that can exploit the situation  They lie in wait of these exact situations  and salivate at the opportunity to exercise their advantage    Dirty  or structured term sheets are proposed investments where the majority of the economic gains for the investor come not from the headline valuation  but rather through a series of dirty terms that are hidden deeper in the document  This allows the Shark to meet the valuation  ask  of the entrepreneur and VC board member  all the while knowing that they will make excellent returns  even at exits that are far below the cover valuation   Examples of dirty terms include guaranteed IPO returns  ratchets  PIK Dividends  series based M A vetoes  and superior preferences or liquidity rights  The typical Silicon Valley term sheet does not include such terms  The reason these terms can produce returns by themselves is that they set the stage for a rejiggering of the capitalization table at some point in the future  This is why the founder and their VC BOD member can still hold onto the illusion that everything is fine  The adjustment does not happen now  it will happen later   Dirty term sheets are a massive problem for two reasons  One is that they  unpack  or  explode  at some point in the future  You can no longer simply look at the cap table and estimate your return  Once you have accepted a dirty offering  the payout at each potential future valuation requires a complex analysis  where the return for the Shark is calculated first  and then the remains are shared by everyone else  The second reason they are a massive problem is that their complexity will render future financings all but impossible   Any investor asked to follow a dirty offering will look at the complexity of the previous offering and likely opt out  This severely heightens the risk of either running out of money or a complete recapitalization that wipes out previous shareholders  founder  employees  and investors alike   So  while it may seem innocuous to take such a round  and while it will solve your short term emotional biases and concerns  you may be putting your whole company in a much riskier position without even knowing it   Some later stage investors may be tempted to become Sharks themselves and start including structured terms into their own term sheets  Following through and succeeding at such a strategy will require these investors to truly embrace being a Shark  They will need to be comfortable knowing that they are adverse to and in conflict with the founders  employees  and other investors on the capitalization chart  And they will need to be content knowing that they can win while others lose  This is not for the faint of heart  and certainly is not consistent with the typical investor behavior of the past several years   Let us now take a deeper dive into what this new fundraising environment means for each participant in the ecosystem   Entrepreneurs Founders CEOs  Today s Unicorn entrepreneur has been trained in an environment that may look radically different from what lies ahead  Here is the historic perspective  Money has been easy to raise  The market favors growth over profits  Competition also has access to capital  So  raise as much as you can as fast as you can  and be super ambitious  Take as much market share as you can   Never in the history of venture capital have early stage startups had access to so much capital  Back in 1999  if a company raised  30mm before an IPO  that was considered a large historic raise  Today  private companies have raised 10x that amount and more  And consequently  the burn rates are 10x larger than they were back then  All of which creates a voraciously hungry Unicorn  One that needs lots and lots of capital  if it is to stay on the current trajectory    For the first time  perhaps in their lives  these entrepreneurs may face a situation where they cannot raise a clean incremental financing at a flat to up round  This is uncharted territory  There are a few alternatives   The first option available to many Unicorns today is a dirty term sheet  As discussed above  these terms can cleverly fool the inexperienced operator  because they are able to  meet the ask  with respect to cover valuation  and the accepting founder does not realize the carnage that will come down the road  The only reason one would accept such a deal is to maintain valuation appearances that simply do not matter  Taking a terms laden deal is like starting the clock on a time bomb  Your only option is to hit the IPO window as fast as possible  Note  Box and Square were able to thread this needle successfully   otherwise  the terms will eat you alive  The main problem is that you will never raise another private round again  as no new investor will want to live on top of the termy round  So you will be stuck negotiating with the lender that already proved they were smarter than you  Take a clean round at a lower valuation  This will seem like a massive failure to many modern entrepreneurs  but they should quickly adjust their thinking  Reed Hastings at Netflix raised money in a high profile down round as a public CEO  Every single public CEO has had days where the stock price falls   it is common and accepted  The only thing you are protecting is image and ego and in the long run they absolutely do not matter  You should be more concerned about the long term valuation of your shares  and minimizing the chance that you have the whole thing taken away from you  Terms are the true Godzilla that should scare you to death  A down round is nothing  Get over it and move on  Option  2 is way better than option  1  Buckle down and do whatever it takes to get cash flow positive with your current cash balance  This might be the most foreign of all the choices  as your board of directors has been advising you to do the exact opposite for the past four years  You have been told to be  bold  and  ambitious  and that there is no better time to grab market share  Despite this  the only way to be completely in control of your own destiny is to remove the need for incremental capital raises altogether  Achieving profitability is the most liberating action a startup can accomplish  Now you make your own decisions  It will also minimize future dilution  Gavin Baker  a high profile portfolio manager at Fidelity has a message for Unicorn CEOs   Generate  1 of free cash flow  and then you can invest everything else in growth and stay at  1 in free cash flow for years  I get that you want to grow and I want you to grow  but let s internally finance that growth by spending gross margin dollars rather than new dilutive dollars of equity  Ultimately  internally financing growth is the only way to control your own destiny rather than being at the mercy of the capital markets   Go public  In the long run  the very best way for founders to look after their own ownership as well as that of their employees is to IPO  Until an IPO  common shares sit behind preferred shares  Most preferred shares have different types of control functions and most of them have a senior preference over common  If you really want to liberate your own common shares and those of your employees  then you want to convert the preferred to common and remove both the control and the liquidation preference over your shares  Many founders have been erroneously advised that IPOs are bad things and that the way to success is to  stay private longer   Not only is an IPO better for your company  see Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Benioff on this subject   but an IPO is the best way to ensure the long term value of your  and your employees   shares   It is worth noting that stock prices go up and stock prices go down  There is not a single high profile public company that has been able to avoid time periods where their shares underperformed  Amazon went from  106 to  6 as a public company  Salesforce went from  16 to  6 and stayed below  10 for many months  Netflix went from  38 to  8 in six months  Remember Facebook s first six months as a public company   If you cannot handle a down valuation you should seriously consider abandoning the CEO position  Being a great leader means leading in good times as well as tough times  Taking a dirty deal is jeopardizing the future of your company  solely because you are afraid to lead through difficult news   Employees  The explicit details of the capital structure of a company are typically obfuscated from the average employee  You know you work for a Unicorn  and you know you have some common shares  You might also know what percentage you own  And unfortunately  you may assume that the product of your Unicorn valuation and your percentage ownership is what you are worth  Of course  for that to be true  you need to reach a liquidity event  IPO or M A  at or above the last round valuation with no incremental dilution from new rounds  But guess what  M A is scarce  no large company wants to pay these prices or absorb these burn rates   and many founders have been told IPOs are bad  So how will you ever get liquid   For the most part  employees are in the exact same position as founders  above   with the exception that they don t participate in the decision tree outlined above in 1 4  That said  they should be asking the exact same questions of management  Can we get to break even on the money we have  Do we need to raise more money  If so  can we do it on clean terms  vs  dirty   Employees should want to know if the founder CEO would did take a dirty deal  because common is at the most risk in such a situation  And then you should want to know if your leader is anti IPO  If your CEO founder will take a dirty round  and is also anti IPO the chance that you will ever see liquidity for you shares anywhere near what you think they are worth is very  very low  You should probably move on to another company   INVESTORS  Disclosure  It should be noted that the author of the article and his investment firm reside in this category   For the most part  early investors in Unicorns are in the same position as founders and employees  This is because these companies have raised so much capital that the early investor is no longer a substantial portion of the voting rights or the liquidation preference stack  As a result  most of their interests are aligned with the common  and key decisions about return and liquidity are the same as for the founder  This investor will also be wary of the dirty term sheet which has the ability to wrestle away control of the entire company  This investor will also have sufficient angst about the difference between paper return and real return  and the lack of overall liquidity in the market  Or at least they should   The one exception to this is the late stage investor or the deep pocketed investor who may represent a substantial part of the overall money raised  This particular type of investor may have protected their ownership through the use of active pro rata or super pro rata investing  They may have even encouraged the aggressive  spend to win  mentality knowing that they can keep writing checks  They have been acting like a loose aggressive player at a poker table   There are two forces which have began to slow down this type of investor  First  as failure has begun to arrive on the scene  these investors have suffered some really big write offs  These spectacular losses result in a lack of confidence not only for the investor  but more importantly for their LPs  The second problem is that for many of these investors  a single holding can become too large relative to the overall fund  They basically cannot afford to expose themselves to any more risk in a particular name  They use euphemisms to describe having over eaten such as  fully allocated  or  at capacity    This form of big investor indigestion has created a really bizarre and unprecedented activity in the Unicorn world  High profile investors  who are already armed with plenty of capital  have resorted to hitting the phone banks to solicit others to pile in behind them in their names  The voracious Unicorns need even more capital than these big boys can afford  Ironically  if you look at the big historic wins of this investor class  there is no record of sending out Evites to other investors  But now they  need  others  which should signal risk to all parties involved  More on this later   Investors also have to worry about raising their next fund  which can lead to unusual behavior that is independent of each individual company s situation  Do you support the dirty term sheet because this allows you to keep your paper mark and not spook your investors  Even though you know this may be bad for the company in the long run  Do you feel the need to raise more capital quickly before the prices erode further and bring down your IRR  Do you feel the need to have more money to keep feeding the cash hungry companies you have already funded   LIMITED PARTNERS  LPS   LPs are the large pools of capital  such as endowments and foundations  that invest in VC firms  hedge funds and the like  They are the real capital that make the system work  LPs evaluate the performance of the different investors in the ecosystem and make decisions about whether to fund their next effort or not  It s a difficult job because the feedback cycles are so long   especially when it comes to investing in illiquid assets like startups  and Unicorns    Another big challenge for LPs is that they are asked to measure the performance of these illiquid assets even though doing so is quite difficult and may not be indicative of future real cash returns  In this case  many LPs have incorporated the high performance of Unicorn valuations into their overall results which has created very strong performance gains for the venture capital category  In a sense they have already  banked  the gains  The problem obviously is that the lack of any material liquidity in the market combined with the recent correction creates a risk that they may not see the actual cash returns for the paper gains they already booked   Furthermore  as mentioned earlier  they may face increased solicitation from VC firms who want to accelerate their fundraising process in the middle of this highly anxious environment  A recent WSJ article   Venture Capital Firms Draw a Rush of New Money   highlights that VC firms are raising new funds from LPs at the highest rate in 15 years  even though cash liquidity is sitting at a seven year low  A few sentences from the article are worth republishing here   In recent years venture firms have written bigger checks and encouraged companies to spend to battle for market supremacy  That left some venture firms short of cash  requiring them to raise money sooner than in years past to continue reaping fees and making new investments   Some venture capitalists say the fundraising spike is timed to ensure that paper gains on startup investments still look attractive   Cash distributions are what matter at the end of the day  but big paper gains still make for good fundraising pitches   In addition to these issues  there has also been an increase in  inside rounds  where investors write new checks into companies where they are already investors  avoiding the  market check  that might have resulted in a potentially down valuation  This activity  which has an obvious conflict of interest  makes the LP s job of judging VC performance even more difficult   Against this difficult backdrop  many firms are asking their LPs to make new accelerated commitments to their next fund  exactly when evaluation is most difficult and anxiety may be at a cyclical peak  Moreover  deep down most LPs know that performance in the VC sector is counter cyclical to the amount of money raised by VCs  If you over fund the industry  aggregate returns fall  Writing huge checks to bloated multibillion dollar VC funds could easily exacerbate the problems that already exist   One response from the LP community might be to demand commitments from new funds that prohibit inside led rounds and cross fund investing  This can help to ensure that new capital is not put to use in an attempt to save previous investment decisions   an activity known as  throwing good money after bad    If this were not enough  some LPs are also being solicited to participate in SPVs  Special Purpose Vehicles   frequently from the very funds they have backed  As discussed earlier  some investors have reached a stage when they are overcommitted to a particular company in a particular fund   at capacity    Yet these investors want to keep providing capital to their Unicorns and support a growth over profits attitude  So they create a one time special purpose investment vehicle  while greedily asking for even more carry   And the SPV has the added risk that is has no portfolio diversification or  look back  feature to provide downside protection   Obviously the LPs can just say  no  to participating in the SPV  even though they may feel the pressure of obligation from the fund   This is likely the smart move  First  someone is asking you to write a check at the exact time everyone else is overcommitted  Hey  come help us out  we are drowning over here  Second  you already have ample exposure to this exact company  through your original investment  Lastly  it is quite unlikely that a historical study of peak cycle SPV participation shows good returns   ALL PREVIOUSLY UNTAPPED FINANCIAL SOURCES  FAMILY OFFICES  SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS  ETC   If you have a large pool of money and you haven t been approached to invest in a Unicorn  it s simply because people do not know where to find you  There are three types of people who are likely now approaching you  all of whom you should engage with quite carefully   SPV promoters   As mentioned in the section on LPs  investors have also broadened their SPV marketing more broadly to family offices and other pools of capital  The pitches typically involve phrases such as  you are invited to  or  we will provide access to  an opportunity to invest  This  you are so lucky to have this opportunity  pitch is eerily Madoffian  And remember  this solicitation is coming from investors who actually have money  but already know they are overcommitted  Brokers and 3rd tier investment banks promoting the sale of secondary shares in Unicorn companies   If you ask any large family office  they will tell you they are being bombarded with calls and emails offering secondary positions in Unicorn companies  Often with teasers such as  20 40  discount to last round price   Incremental Unicorn round   You might also be called on simply to pump more capital into a standard Unicorn round  With many investors  at capacity  due to the historic amounts of capital already raised  some companies are looking under any and every rock they can for more dollars   One of the shocking realities that is present in many of these  investment opportunities  is a relative absence of pertinent financial information  One would think that these opportunities which are often sold as  pre IPO  rounds would have something close to the data you might see in an S 1  But often  the financial information is quite limited  And when it is included  it may be presented in a way that is inconsistent with GAAP standards  As an example  most Unicorn CEOs still have no idea that discounts  coupons  and subsidies are contra revenue   If an audit is included  it might have massive  qualifications  where the auditor lists all the reasons that this particular audit may not comply with GAAP standards and that things could change materially if they dig in deeper  Investors need to really open their eyes to the fact that these are not IPOs  The companies have not been scrubbed in the same way  and the numbers they are looking at on a PowerPoint deck are potentially erroneous  Here is a recommendation  If you are about to write a multimillion dollar check for an incremental Unicorn investment  ask to speak to the auditor  Find out exactly how much scrutiny has been applied   New potential investors might also be surprised how few Unicorn executives truly understand their core unit economics  One easy way to spot these pretenders is that they obsessively focus on high level  gross merchandise value  or  multi year forward bookings  and try to talk past things like true net revenue  gross margin  or operating profitability  They will even claim to be  unit profitable  when all they have really done is stopped being gross margin negative  These companies will one day need real earnings and real profits  and if the company does not proactively address this  you should not be giving them millions of dollars in late stage financings   Perhaps the biggest mistake untapped investors will make is assuming that because there are branded investors already in the company  that the new investment opportunity must be of high quality  They use the reputation of the other investors as a proxy for due diligence  There are multiple problems with this shortcut  First  these investors are  pot committed   They invested a long time ago  and without your money their investment is  at risk   Second  as discussed  they are already full and nervous  They didn t call you before when they built their reputation  Why are they friendly now   The main message for investors who are just now being approached is the following  it s not the second inning or even the sixth  it s the fourteenth inning in a five hour baseball game  You are not being invited to a special dance  you are being approached because you are the lender of last resort  And because of how we meandered to this place in time  parting with your dollars now would be an extremely risky move  Caveat emptor   SEC Visits Silicon Valley  A few weeks ago  on March 31  2016  the Chair of the SEC made a trip to Silicon Valley and gave a speech at an event at Stanford Law School  For those that are participating in Unicorn investing or for those considering investing in Unicorns  it would be a good idea to read the entirety of her presentation  which can be found here   Bloomberg s interpretation of her presentation was that  Silicon Valley Needs To Corral Its Unicorns    Chair White seems quite aware of the issues and pressures that have an ability to distort the Unicorn fundraising process   Nearly all venture valuations are highly subjective  But  one must wonder whether the publicity and pressure to achieve the unicorn benchmark is analogous to that felt by public companies to meet projections they make to the market with the attendant risk of financial reporting problems   And then she sends a message to all former and future investors regarding the need for increased due diligence   As I will discuss  the risk of distortion and inaccuracy is amplified because start up companies  even quite mature ones  often have far less robust internal controls and governance procedures than most public companies  Vigilance by private companies about the accuracy of their financial results and other disclosures is thus especially critical   It would be quite unfortunate if the fundraising behavior of the Unicorn herd led to increased SEC involvement and rules with respect to private venture backed startups  But if those involved believe that  not being public  also means  not being responsible   we will quickly find ourselves in that exact place  We will have deservedly invited more scrutiny   Mo Money Mo Problems  Perhaps the biggest lapse in judgment for all of those involved is the assumption that if we can just raise  one more round  everything will be fine  Founders have come to believe that more money is better  and the fluidity of the recent funding environment has led many to believe that heroic fundraising is a competitive advantage  Ironically  the exact opposite is true  The very best entrepreneurs are relatively advantaged in times of scarce capital  They can raise money in any environment  Loose capital allows the less qualified to participate in each market  This less qualified player brings more reckless execution which drags even the best entrepreneur onto an especially sloppy playing field  This threatens returns for all involved   The reason we are all in this mess is because of the excessive amounts of capital that have poured into the VC backed startup market  This glut of capital has led to  1  record high burn rates  likely 5 10x those of the 1999 timeframe   2  most companies operating far  far away from profitability   3  excessively intense competition driven by access to said capital   4  delayed or non existent liquidity for employees and investors  and  5  the aforementioned solicitous fundraising practices  More money will not solve any of these problems   it will only contribute to them  The healthiest thing that could possibly happen is a dramatic increase in the real cost of capital and a return to an appreciation for sound business execution,"[1 1378 545 398 1238 752 1044

3,training-dataset/business/222.txt,business,The Arc of Company Life   and How to Prolong ItOn its 100th birthday in 2011  IBM ran a four page ad in The Wall Street Journal  Washington Post  and New York Times  It said   Nearly all the companies our grandparents admired have disappeared  Of the top 25 companies on the Fortune 500 in 1961  only six remain today   The ad may have been designed to hail IBM s resilience  but it also highlighted a telling observation for the new companies emerging today in Silicon Valley and elsewhere   Consider the recent examples of Kodak and Blackberry  Both held sacred positions in their respective markets before their demise  Both had pioneered technologies but failed to adjust in the face of undeniable disruption  Why did they fail to take action  Why  in an age when everyone is focused on the rocket like ascent of brands  do so many entrepreneurs ignore the need to keep innovating   In this exclusive piece  Mark Leslie  longtime Chairman and CEO of VERITAS Software  advisor and investor  and author of a foundational article on the startup Sales Learning Curve   brings the corporate  Arc of Life  into sharp relief  explains how companies can avoid plateau and decay  and lays out what this means for the new crop of startups with hopes pinned on long term success   The Corporate Arc of Life  Successful enterprises have a cycle of life  Startups build a product or service  enter the market and attract customers  Once they re over these initial hurdles  they enter a growth phase  rapidly increasing their revenue and market share with big gains year over year  They continue to work on their product  fine tuning it as revenue starts to flatten and margins stabilize at lower but still attractive levels   As these companies mature  growth slows even more  eventually flattening out   yet operational expenses continue to climb as they strive to compete with new players in the market  Finally  unable to keep up  burdened with bloated budgets  companies spiral into negative growth  marked by layoffs  high burn rates and eventual bankruptcy or liquidation   This paints a pretty bleak picture   especially if one considers the inevitability of this pattern   but it s important to note that this cycle plays out over drastically different time lines for different companies  Many successful companies have prolonged their relevance for decades  and some for over a century  Technology companies are just like  real companies  except that the cycle is shorter so everything happens faster   Great companies endure  The key to enduring growth is strategic transformation  When a company forgoes the  good life  of maturity  controlled growth and market leadership and is willing to take on the risk of transformation in the face of existential risks  it can achieve new levels of growth and extend its horizons   The ability to do this is largely dependent on the type of leader charting the course  Most leaders fall into one of two categories  Opportunity Driven or Operationally Driven  As you ll read below  there are incredible advantages to having an Opportunity Driven leader at the helm to drive transformation  Operationally Driven leaders  while excellent at driving efficiency and predictability  may place the company at long term risk as it merely stays on track on the Arc of Life   Oracle and the Opportunity Driven Leader  One of the largest and most influential software companies in the world  Oracle was originally founded as Software Development Laboratories in 1977  Between then and 1982  the company searched for product market fit  eventually determining how to commercialize its relational database system for enterprise companies  That s when it was officially named Oracle and entered growth  But when most early employees recall what gave the company its early competitive edge  they point to CEO Larry Ellison   Bruce Scott  co architect and co author of the first three versions of the Oracle database put it this way   I ve thought a lot about why Oracle was successful    It was really Larry s charisma  vision  and his determination to make this thing work no matter what  I can give you an example of his thought processes  We had space allocated to us  and we needed to get our terminals strung to the computer room next door  We didn t have anywhere to string the wiring    Larry picks up a hammer  crashes a hole in the middle of the wall and says   There you go    This description of Ellison as a risk taker who saw quick  unorthodox solutions to keep things moving calls attention to one of most important characteristics of enduring companies  their CEOs are Opportunity Driven leaders  You can identify this type of leader by their ability to not just see the future but seize it  their comfort with unconventional strategies  and their acceptance of bold risk  They don t measure their success by rankings  quarterly earnings or liquidity events  They have a more grandiose vision to change the world  build a global brand  upend an existing industry   Another key example of the opportunity driven leader is Satya Nadella  who was named CEO of Microsoft in 2014  During his predecessor Steve Ballmer s 14 year tenure  the company had lost its spot as the industry s mover and shaker  The stock price languished for all of those years  Since Nadella s arrival  Microsoft has resurged as a major player in the industry  He broke a lot of the company s old rules  committing to becoming a first rank cloud player  He successfully built interest in Windows 10 from both consumers and developers  and has overseen the launch of a bevy of new products  ranging from the new Outlook for iPhone to the incredibly ambitious HoloLens  He even orchestrated a massive layoff that successfully made the company leaner and faster  The stock responded in turn  steadily rising from the mid  30s to  today  over  60 per share   This type of leader drives change with charisma and force of personality that can be better described as gravitational pull than a management style  Companies need this type of figure to justify unusual  unintuitive and risky shifts in direction  It s not enough for them to convince people that they are right  or to follow them down a different road   they make any other choice or destination seem untenable   The Sweet Spot for Transformation  When Oracle got its start building portable  scalable database systems  there were many other startups in the market trying to do the same thing   Most of them made their competitive edge about more features and better performance  while Oracle focused on an industry wide platform   making its database compatible with as many computing platforms as possible  IBM  Digital Equipment  many flavors of UNIX  NT  etc    By the mid 1980s  its software could be used on 80 different vendor systems  enabling it to be used by almost any enterprise   Oracle s versatility distinguished it as the choice for application developers and resellers because it also gave them access to much larger markets   As the need for applications grew  so did Oracle s top line  By 1987  it was the world s largest database management company with revenue over  100 million and 4 500 clients in 55 countries  Spotting the source of this success  Ellison brought in Jeff Walker  founder of one of the top accounting application development firms  and charged him with building an applications division within the company   He did this even though Oracle had many moreyears of steady growth and healthy margins to harvest from its database business  He did this even though Oracle s own applications wouldn t take off until the 90s  Most importantly  he did this in the face of the fact that the application vendors  i e   People Soft  SAP  etc   who  pulled  through his product would now see Oracle as a competitor with an unfair advantage instead of as an enabler  In so doing  Ellison put his existing market at great risk  He saw the opportunity for transformation and used the momentum the company had during its growth phase to make it possible   There s a moment along the corporate Arc of Life between growth and maturity that allows for Maximum Optionality   that s the sweet spot for change and renewal  How can you see this moment coming  Here s what it usually looks like   You re finally out of the startup phase and no longer have to worry about scarce resources or traction   The organization has achieved a measure of stability   the future looks bright  revenue is climbing  and the business model has gelled   You just reached a point where you have the talent  money and market influence to do something new while maintaining and growing the core business   The wind is at your back   As a startup approaches the crest of its growth curve  its leader has a choice to make  Will the company take advantage of its momentum and initiative to steer into uncharted waters  a new line of products  a new business category  a new industry   Or will it continue along the well marked path squeezing as much as it can out of its existing business   When things are going well  most leaders are reluctant to take significant unnecessary risks in favor of market dominance  In doing so  they fail to see what lurks on the other side of  success    plateau and decline  Even as ecosystems shift around them  they hold onto what they know and what has worked before instead of innovating to fit customers  new expectations   In stark contrast  Opportunity Driven leaders see the sweet spot of optionality not as a risk but as a springboard to hurtle the company to the next level  Their vision charts the course the company needs to take  and their conviction in the choice compels their core employees to commit to the journey even if the outcome isn t immediately clear   The Road Less Taken  In retrospect  the need for innovation can seem obvious  and even easy  But deciding to take this road   branching away from the traditional Arc of Life   is anything but   At the time  Oracle branching into the applications business was a radical move  Not only did the initiative surpass the scale of anything the company had attempted  it also declared war on the application resellers whose livelihoods depended on its software   essentially forcing them to choose between Oracle and its competitors and threatening the very revenue stream that financed its new applications business   Despite these many challenges  Oracle was able to make room in the market for its own application products  Still  the amount it invested in the area was considered by many to be distracting and reckless  particularly when the company was still capturing massive year over year revenue growth from its core database business  What they didn t see was that license revenue from this business was starting to flatten at a quicker and quicker pace   While not immediately visible to people even inside the company  applications represented Oracle s next cresting wave   One barrier remained in the company s path  SAP  the 800 pound gorilla in the market producing client server based applications for enterprise  There was no way around it  Oracle couldn t take down SAP to become the number one provider of enterprise apps unless the landscape changed  So it took another big gamble on top of its already risky app strategy and built a new landscape for the industry   In his biography of Oracle and Ellison  Softwar  Matthew Symonds described this flashpoint   To the horror of many colleagues and customers   Ellison decided  to abandon all further development of client server based applications and concentrate the entire firm s engineering effort on building for the Internet    Oracle s sales force bristled and customers fled  But Ellison wouldn t be deterred from this brand new direction   They were mistaking the present for the future   he said   Client server was dead and the people in the room would figure that out at the funeral   He knew Oracle couldn t wait to change course   Other companies were building web based applications at the time  but Oracle was the only one that went all in to wholeheartedly pursue an internet strategy at the risk of its entire business  Ellison was quoted at the time   If the internet turns out not to be the future of computing  we re toast  If it is  we re golden    In 2000  the company introduced the Oracle E Business Suite  the first fully integrated  comprehensive suite of business applications for the enterprise  It obliterated the need for expensive system integrations and earned immediate popularity for its ease and efficiency   Oracle has remained committed to strategic transformation  After 25 years of zero acquisitions  it turned its firepower on consolidating the enterprise application market with massive acquisitions  First came Peoplesoft in 2003 for  5 1 billion in the Valley s first ever hostile takeover  BEA and many others quickly followed  Oracle eventually rolled up all of its competitors except for SAP  finally assuming market dominance   Its most recent bet was the acquisition of Sun Microsystems to become a fully integrated systems supplier  Not all bets taken are won  and it s likely too early to tell on this latest one   It s also worth noting an interesting side bet  Larry Ellison is the principal investor and majority owner of NetSuite in the same business on the lower end of the marketplace    Oracle s dogged pursuit of this position in the space illustrates one of the more important lessons of the corporate Arc of Life  An organization s transformations will inevitably vary in scale  time to execute and impact on the business   But  when taken together  a series of successful transformations   big or small   will meld over time into an overarching story of transformation and extended life expectancy   Here s how that looks   And here s how it looked for Oracle   Another example of a company buoyed by many transformations is Amazon   with Jeff Bezos  another truly opportunity driven leader spearheading change  Over its 20 year history  Amazon has taken advantage of sweet spots of optionality to cover new ground and develop products far outside its core competency  all while shaping the way consumers buy and retailers sell online   One of Amazon s biggest points of transformation was the launch of zShops  the platform that enabled small businesses to set up their own virtual storefronts and sell products through the site  While it was not a game changer on its own  it ultimately led to the creation of Amazon Web Services  leveraging the company s internal software architecture to provide other businesses with affordable cloud services  In this case  a huge  successful detour from the business sprang from a smaller venture  Web Services is now growing at a faster rate than Amazon s consumer facing retail operations   The takeaway is that not all transformations have to change the world  Some may just make a dent or open a door  It s virtually guaranteed that not all attempts at radical change will succeed  It s up to the opportunity driven leader to weigh the risk of failure against the risk of reward  Does your company have the financial fortitude  employee loyalty and broad support it needs to survive a failed attempt at metamorphosis  Or are the consequences simply too dire  Sometimes a company needs to make the leap even if the latter is true   The Operationally Driven Leader  On the flip side of this narrative  you have the many hundreds if not thousands of companies that have gone the way of the woolly mammoth because of their inability to adapt   Oracle and Amazon are far and away the exceptions to a much storied rule  In almost all cases  the CEO dutifully leads their company down the path of metrics focused execution and reliable growth  Along the way  they either intentionally bypass sweet spots of optionality or miss chances to bring new ideas into the company   These leaders are more driven by operational excellence and efficiency   becoming the foil to Opportunity Driven leaders  They re motivated to achieve established metrics and conventional definitions of success   This type of person is well suited to run the show during the period in a company s life when seamless execution is needed after major transformation  They may even be skilled at articulating a vision for the future  But that vision is more likely to be conservative  smaller in scale  less risky  Ironically  these types of CEOs are revered by Wall Street as their companies perform reliably quarter after quarter  That is  until they fall off the growth curve and have no place to go   Even when Operationally Driven leaders see a sweet spot for transformation  they will probably fail to seize it   they don t have the same tolerance for risk  the ability to stand up to naysayers or the charisma to pull an organization along with them  Vision doesn t matter if a leader doesn t have the audacity to pursue it   The Operationally Driven leader may excel at trekking a marked path but does not wield a machete to create a new one   Under this type of leadership  a company can enjoy many good years climbing toward maturity  But failure to create new growth curves when the moment is right puts even the most successful companies in history at risk of extinction   Nokia is a prime example of a company that has historically been in the lead but is now struggling to stay afloat  Like Oracle  the company built its success on early transformative leaps  A lot of people don t know that it started as a paper mill in Finland in 1871  and is one of the best examples of a company that has changed perfectly with the times   When cars became more prevalent  Nokia evolved into a rubber manufacturer making everything from tires to rain galoshes  When telephones started to enter the mainstream  it became one of the first telecommunications companies  developing radio telephones for the army  This attitude continued into the 1980s when it launched the first mobile car phone  By the 1990s  it was the global leader in mobile phone technology   Now  with Apple and Samsung splitting the mobile market between them  Nokia has been losing market share steadily for the last four years  It simply stopped innovating  Its leadership stopped taking huge bets  and the lack of a new growth curve is only now becoming apparent   particularly with the sale of its device business to Microsoft in 2013  Unless Nokia s leadership is willing and able to make a transformative leap of the same size and scale that it did in its early history  this could be the end of the line   Ironically  and increasingly   Apple s Tim Cook is drifting into the operationally driven category  Since his ascendency to the CEO role  the company has done a good job of running the business side of the equation  But it s also lost some of its luster  Each new version of the iPhone  its flagship product  is less interesting than the last one  Their greatest product innovation under Cook seems to be EarPods   a great way for Apple to extract more money from their base  but not something that one might call  insanely great   Famed entrepreneur Steve Blank refers to Cook as the new Steve Ballmer  Yes  Steve Jobs left a pretty great playbook  But what s Cook going to do when the playbook is all played out  Apple stock has done well so far based on the huge momentum the company enjoyed  But few in the know think it ll go up in the long term   The Upshot  No matter what excuses are made or exceptions declared  it s the rule that companies at one time viewed as clear winners will ultimately experience the threat of decline and extinction at the end of the Arc of Life  No organization is immune to this fate  Only a select few have demonstrated their ability to undertake enough transformative shifts to extend their life decades beyond their competition   Although a company s trajectory may be influenced by any number of factors   market forces  political climates  economic spikes and dips  popular trends   it s arguable that nothing is more critical than the vision and path set by its leader   To ensure long term success  boards of directors and investors should seek out and reward CEOs who are Opportunity Driven leaders  willing to punch holes in walls and embrace new  often dangerous risks before the road ahead starts to flatten and becomes more certain  As promising and profitable as good valuations and strong market positions may appear  they do not guarantee a company will endure for the long haul   It is sad but true that there is no

things positive at SaaStr  and  22 Reasons I Would Fund You  would be a more positive title  But it wouldn t be as helpful  The reasons one early stage start up gets funded and another doesn t can be opaque  Some investors bet on the best engineering teams  Others bet on traction  Others are thesis investors  Others bet on chutzpah  Etc  etc   So instead  let me assemble a checklist of 22 reasons I almost immediately pass on investing in start ups that are interesting  That otherwise might be worth digging in on more  So if you take some of these issues off the table  maybe  it will increase the odds in your favor with fundraising in general   Can t See The Future  I take it as a given you know your existing customers   even if it s just 2 or 3 of them  ideally 10 for me   And your existing market  But if you can t tell me the future  in your market  at least 3 years out   then it s hard for me to believe in SaaS you ll ever build a unicorn  So I always have to pass here  no matter how good the metrics look today  The very best founders can see the future  Not perfectly  But far better than I ever could   Quarterly MRR   100  Gross Margins  and Other Crazy Metrics  I m not expecting you to be a CFA  CFO  or CPA  But if your metrics make truly zero sense  to me  that s a flag  The biggest offender is  Quarterly MRR   when founders combine three months of MRR into one number  This doesn t make you look 3x bigger  It makes you look like you take me for a fool  or at least  are trying to pull the wool over my eyes  Tell it to me straight  I care far less about your exact MRR today  than where you are going  Gaming the metrics doesn t help here  It hurts  Founder Disalignment   Wrong Founder as CEO  If the founders are going to break up in the next 12 months  the company can still make it  But it s not a journey I want to be on  On a related point  more than 3 co founders is a flag  Not a deal breaker  but worrisome  Companies can t be run by a quorum  At least  Not well  Exit Strategy Slide  I want to hear that you are building a unicorn   or at least  trying  At least that you believe you are unicorn hunting  An Exit Strategy Slide almost by definition tells me you aren t  So do something different  Give me a  Comparables Slide  instead  For example  with Automile  your Comparable could say  Like Fleetmatics  Acquired by Verizon for  2 5 billion  but Addressing a Larger Segment of the Market   That gives me confidence  Telling me you have a plan to sell for  50m does not  At a minimum  just delete this slide if you are presenting to any VC fund    60m or so in size  Lack of Understanding of the Competition  Almost everyone has competition  I get worried if you have no respect for your competition  but sometimes  I can get past that  But not understanding your competition  That s a No  Why do your competitors beat you  Why do you lose deals  What are they good at   at least  on a relative basis  Yes  you have a few better features  Of course you do  That s why you have paying customers  But how will the competitive landscape look next year  and the year after  I Wouldn t Work For You  This one you can t really control  but I only want to invest in founders that can build a management team  Otherwise  you ll stall out somewhere between  1m and  5m in ARR  when you need to build a real set of VPs  If I wouldn t work for you   then I can t help you recruit folks that will  Too Slow  And or Late  You re in sales  If it takes you a week to respond to an email  If you show up late and don t email me ahead of time  If you don t take an amazing VP intro I give you  I m out  Don t Want Me  I m quirky here  but I want to know that you want me as an investor  There are many sources of capital  If I am a fungible source of capital  I m probably the wrong choice  If you don t really think I might be able to be the most useful investor to you  at least a certain stage   then it s probably not a good fit  At least  make me believe this    Party Round  This isn t an absolute  but I don t want to be one of 20 investors in the round  I d prefer to be the only investor  or if that doesn t work  one of the 2 big ones at least  20 investors  Well  no one is on the hook for helping the company  Except me  And if I m 1 of 20   you re asking too much of me  Convertible Debt and SAFEs if Round Size is Material  If you are raising  500k  anything is good  debt  SAFEs  IOUs  MOUs  But  2m  on debt or SAFEs  95  chance I m out  No one really cares as much here  So you are raising too much without anyone with enough skin in the game  Who is going to help you raise the next round  Recruit the VPs  I won t if I don t have enough vested in you  So it s easier just to pass here  No One on the Board Representing the Investors  This is related to the last two points  but if no one is going to be on the board to at least represent all the investors  I m out  I don t want  need  or care about control  But I do care about fiduciary responsibilities and checks and balances  Any Inappropriate  Sexist  Locker Room  or other Such Comments  If you think there s even a 1  chance you re saying something offensive  just don t bring it up  There are 100 reasons this isn t OK  I don t just mean the blatant stuff  I also mean slightly more subtle stuff  Even best case  I won t believe you can build a unicorn if I feel at all you aren t committed to building a truly welcoming and diverse environment  Best case  50 90  of the world won t really want to work for you  That s a problem  Can t Get to The Point  I don t need 28 slides on how Everything is Going To the Cloud  The pitch really should take less than 5 minutes  The pitch really should be distilled to one slide  I ll make a Go No Go decision in 5 minutes  and a tentative decision in 20 minutes  If you aren t done with The History of the Internet by Minute 21   It s Hopeless  Stick that in an Appendix  Want to Have Coffee First  I drink 4 cups a day  But I don t have time for this  I have infinite time to meet with great founders doing something great  I have no time to meet for that 5th cup of coffee to  share notes  or  talk about what we re doing   Will Only Send Me Information in  Proprietary  Format  Sometimes I will read a locked DropBox  or a Protected Box document  or a docu send  Sometimes  But usually  I won t  I ll move on  Send me a good old fashioned PDF as an attachment  Together with your model as a Google Sheet or  XLS  Whatever is so secret  just keep it out of the materials  Use these amazing  limited visibility products for sales  Or even for angels  it s fine  a good idea  use them there for sure  But not if you want me to write you a  1m   2m   3m  check  Show me you trust me  Not that I m one of your 300 sales prospects  Maybe I don t deserve the trust yet  But fundraising is all about building trust   If I feel like 1 of 300   I m out  Right or wrong  maybe  wrong   Telling Me the Price is Going Up  That s great  Go ahead  Herd the cats  But I m not buying laundry detergent here  folks  If the price goes up  and it s still good for both of us  so be it  But telling me the price goes up at Midnight isn t the way to build a 10  year relationship  But again  this may work well for small angel checks  Messed Up Cap Table  If you wait to raise  2m on a  6m pre  but you already raised  5m on a  15m pre from  say  an odd mix of billionaires   this is too hard for me to fix  It s not a complete No  but usually  I ll quickly pass if the cap table is too messed up  If you have a quirky cap table   acknowledge it up front and say we can work on it together  Then I m back in  But I don t want to spend time on companies that are structurally unfundable  no matter what the other positives are  CEO Doesn t like Sales   and The Hunt  This is just me  But if you don t really want to sell  To go hunt that bigger deal  that better logo  I m out  The converse is  a bad arse hacker engineer that has also learned to love sales  Well then  that combo   that s something special  Don t Understand How I Can Help  This is also just me  But if I m not sure I can truly help move the needle  then I feel like fungible capital again  I don t want to be that  If I can t help you recruit a management team  help you drive upmarket  promote you  help you scale   then that means there s someone better than me out there for you  This is also why it s harder for me to invest if at least the CEO isn t the Bay Area  ideally full time  but at least  half time  Not Aggressive Enough  Follow up  Get me what I need  Don t be reactive  If you are too passive  then   can you really sell  Can you really compete  Maybe  But I worry  Bad Crazy  You have to be  good crazy  to build a Unicorn  It s just way too hard  You have to recruit too many people  suffer too many dramas  too many near deaths  too many cancelled deals  too many lost partnerships  You have to be good crazy to build a unicorn  Anyone sane will sell before that    But be respectful  Be aggressive  but not a stalker  Follow up once a week  but not once an hour  Make me believe you will drag the team to the summit  Too Balanced  Sorry about this one  I know some will flame me for this  But too many hobbies  too many avocations  It s healthy  It s balanced  But building something big in SaaS is too hard  I really want your avocation to be the same as your vocation  I don t want you in the office 100 hours a week  Actually  I don t even want you in the office 40 hours a week   I want you out with customers    But when you re home  When you re out to dinner  When you re relaxing at the beach  Even  sorry  when you re with your family  I want you obsessing about your company  Not your wine collection  Not because I think this is healthy  It s not  But because I think it s what it takes to win  This is sad to say  but any Unicorn CEO will admit that while Family Comes First  It actually comes second  This is sort of awful  It takes its toll  But it s also generally true   This is just me  Others feel differently  But if you see just a few weaknesses on this list in yourself  maybe  make 1 or 2 changes  I think your fundraising will go much better if you do,"[14 1044 1317 1 856 1136 545 161 432 842 943]"

29,training-dataset/business/1337.txt,business,A founder s guide to working with angel investors   The Startup   MediumA founder s guide to working with angel investors  Raising money the old fashioned way   Angels investors can be a confusing bunch  They re individuals  not professional investors  And individuals are  well  individual  They have different investment theses  different goals  and different styles  One might be a veteran entrepreneur with a deep portfolio who avidly surfs AngelList in search of new prospects while another might be a retired surgeon looking for a new hobby  Some only invest when their friends do and others are comfortable leading rounds and following on  Unlike venture capitalists  angels  only fiduciary responsibility is to themselves   But angels are also a crucial component of the startup ecosystem  They invest at the earliest stage of a company s lifecycle  long before a typical institutional investor would take interest  For businesses that require outside financing  angels can be crucial and sometimes add substantial value beyond cash by making key introductions and giving critical advice  Having the right angel on board can make a world of difference  They provide the kindling for the bonfires entrepreneurs hope to ignite   This makes working with angel investors a special challenge for founders  Finding  wooing  negotiating with  closing  communicating  setting expectations  extracting value and introductions  and building long term relationships with angels can be a fraught and opaque process  especially for first time founders  I ve tried to pull back the curtain on certain aspects of what it s like here  here  and here  Others have gone much farther to improve transparency   But a founder s perspective on managing angel investors is sometimes hard to find  Entrepreneurs are often hesitant to share the details of early financings for fear of upsetting reticent investors  More importantly  entrepreneurs are busy building their businesses   Once I started thinking about this  I couldn t get the idea out of my head  So I set out to find a founder who could shed some light on these issues and share their perspective  There was one guy who I knew would be perfect  I m an investor in his company and have watched him interact with investors since 2011  That guy is George Eiskamp   George is the CEO of GroundMetrics  a startup based in San Diego that offers survey and monitoring services to the world s biggest energy companies  Almost like an MRI for geology  their sensors take full field 3D images of the subsurface which operators use to find and manage natural resources   George has raised nearly  10M from angel investors over multiple rounds  He s set records for size and speed of close with the largest angel group in the US  the Tech Coast Angels  His investors are engaged  enthusiastic  and often participate in multiple raises  And he s done all that for a startup that s not in Silicon Valley and builds both hardware and software based on fundamentally new physics  Not a small feat  and one many founders could learn from   After a few friendly nudges  George generously made time to share his personal experience and insights in this interview  Unlike many puff pieces floating around the internet  his answers go into extreme detail on every aspect of the process  That level of granularity is what s so often missing from financing discussions  and is the ingredient that many entrepreneurs need most   Without further ado  here s George   How did you raise GroundMetrics  first round of angel financing  Can you walk through exactly what happened   GroundMetrics is a spinout from an R D company in San Diego called QFS  QFS specializes in doing advanced science projects for DARPA and other federal agencies  We incubated GroundMetrics inside QFS until outside capital was needed to fund the growth necessary to meet demand  The world s largest oil company  Saudi Aramco  requested a demo in the Kingdom  To ensure success  we needed more capital than available with QFS budgets so we decided this would be a good time to spin out GroundMetrics and raise capital   We were still very early so angel capital seemed like a better fit than venture capital  I believe the best way to raise capital for a new tech venture is with investors that understand the technology  in which case you probably need to convince them of the market opportunity  or visa versa  Few people in the world really understand electromagnetic sensing so we figured we would need to raise capital from oil country i e   Texas or Oklahoma   My co founder and I had raised capital before  but different ventures raise different questions so while we were gearing up to start engaging oil country investors I saw an advertisement about a Tech Coast Angels  TCA   Meet The Angels  event  I believe this was the TCA s first Meet The Angels event and at that time the event consisted of about a dozen angels spread around a banquet hall where entrepreneurs could pitch talk to them  I figured that would be a good way to test drive our pitch and see the various questions and concerns the GroundMetrics venture might run into  I think the count was as follows   I talked to 9  6 expressed interest  3 of those 6 wanted follow up meetings  and  of the 3 not interested  2 said it was outside their wheelhouse and one seemed very opposed  I decided to reach out to the 3 that wanted follow ups for more test driving and to ask if they thought this deal could get done in San Diego despite a lack of oil industry and electromagnetic expertise  They strongly encouraged me to enter the TCA s formal screening process   Initially  we didn t make it through the pre screen  The backchannel feedback was that our pitch was very refined and therefore since I didn t say the pre money valuation was flexible they assumed it wasn t and they felt the valuation was too high and that it would fall flat at screening  I followed up and told them that was flexible and we moved onto screening   About 40 people showed up to the screening  I was told that s about the most they tended to get back then  I pitched and then answered questions  Then I was invited to leave  The process includes a closed door discussion to assess interest  Members are asked to raise hands if they d like to participate and one must volunteer to be the deal lead   negotiate terms and lead due diligence  I was told by one of the TCAs that all 40 raised their hands expressing interest and that to be sure they asked if anyone didn t raise their hand  nope  nobody didn t raise their hand   Then instead of a deal lead with 3 4 people supporting due diligence they came up with 2 deal leads and 4 groups of 3 4 people in each group to support due diligence  a total of about 15 people   At every meeting  pre money was contested and I always said I would consider a lower valuation if they would make a solid case    it s too high  or  we just don t do deals that high  were not solid enough arguments  In the end  not only did we do the deal at the proposed pre money  but it set two records with the San Diego TCA   Fastest raise from term sheet to close  Most raised from the San Diego chapter at  1 2M   That year  TCA only invested in about a dozen companies out of hundreds of applications and most companies needed to visit at least a few of the TCA s five chapters  This deal went so fast that we never left San Diego and I heard that some of the other chapters were disappointed they didn t get a shot to invest  In later raises  we went to Los Angeles and Orange County and had success with those chapters  Unfortunately  we never made it to Santa Barbara and their Inland Empire chapter   GroundMetrics has broken the mold to raise multiple up rounds from angel investors  how did that come about  Why did you elect to grow the company with angel money rather than going institutional   I thought we were too early for venture capital or other institutional money  We weren t ready for a big raise  so angels seemed like the obvious way to start  I knew of a few angel groups  notably the TCA and a few others in oil country  Angels are often pragmatic and patient while entrepreneurs work out the bugs  iterate toward product market fit  and refine the business model  This pragmatism gave us the freedom to set up GroundMetrics for success   How much angel money has GroundMetrics raised to date  From who  How have the later rounds been different than the first round   Nearly  10M   All from angels  The majority of the first round was the TCA  Each subsequent rounded consisted of about 50  existing investors  25  introduced by existing investors  25  via GroundMetrics networking and tapping other angel groups  The easiest money to raise  no money is easy to raise  but comparatively speaking  is from existing shareholders  if they are happy  and investors they bring into the mix  That was the big difference  Our shareholder base has remained excited about GroundMetrics so they come back  often multiple times  with a few having invested in every financing   I never imagined we would be able to come so far with angel financing  We had opportunities to do institutional rounds  but our shareholders wanted to fill our needs themselves and they have been great to work with so we haven t needed to go institutional     Where can founders find angel investors   Good old fashioned networking  Look up angel groups online  Ask angels you find who they syndicate with or what other groups they know about  If you happen to know any venture investors  then ask them for angel group recommendations that might be a good fit     What are the tough questions that founders shouldn t forget to ask   How many other deals they have done  Over what time span  How recently  How many deals have they led if they might be a lead for you   How much would they consider investing if they like what they see  Often  the people that ask the most questions and require the largest amount of time are the people who invest the least  Knowing their range early will help you determine how much effort to put into due diligence with them  but keep in mind social capital in addition to their range  For example  they may be influencers within their angel group  or may bring in lots of capital via others or may have meaningful industry  technical  or operational contacts that could help  Plus  remember to always treat people with the utmost respect  Even small amounts of capital are real money that someone worked hard to earn and he she is now considering entrusting you with it   Ask about control terms early if they could be a deal breaker  Some entrepreneurs are not bothered by control terms  but if you are  ask early because you don t want to waste your time  or theirs   Find out why they want whatever control terms are desired to get insight into their perspective and motivations to help gauge alignment  The more aligned you are the less control terms actually matter   What s their philosophy on management  If you want to stay in your position  CEO  CTO  etc   and you deliver perform  will they be okay with you staying in that position  Or are you just filling the seat in the interim until they or the company can find or afford someone else  If they want to replace you  what are they looking for  Ask yourself how you feel about that  If you stay then ask questions about their performance expectations   How can you get them to actually write a check   Create a sense of urgency  One good way to do this is with deadlines  Once you have a critical mass expressing interest  maybe around 50  of what you need to fill your financing or for first closing  then set a first closing date and a second closing date  Give perks to those that invest by those dates  with more perks going to those who invest by the first and less for those who invest by the second  warrants are a common perk in this situation   How much less  Maybe half as much so it s significant  but not so much that they drop because they re upset they missed the first  How much for the first  Enough so that when reduced for the second it s still meaningful for the second   Determine the dates with the investors so they can meet the deadline  They might need time to move capital around and or might want to look under the hood a bit more  etc  You want to make sure the first closing yields the minimum to close by the date selected   How is the dynamic similar different to professional investors or venture capitalists   Angel investor is a vague term   anyone can be an angel  Let s assume we re dealing with  financially sophisticated  angels   In many ways  the dynamic is very similar because they are financially savvy individuals familiar with best practices and want a certain return on their capital   Angels tend to be more patient for an exit if the company is doing well  because they don t have the same time pressures as fund managers that have timeline targets to satisfy their limited partners   With angels  you re herding cats  You ll spend a lot more time taking temperatures and having the same type of conversation numerous times with different people  They sometimes don t have a formal process so you might not know what you need to do or provide until it s requested  Institutions and formal angel groups tend to have a structured process and talk more specifically about what their requirements are and what the timeline will look like   How are your angel investors organized  How do you manage communications with them   Some are grouped together in an LLC and some are individual   They have board representation so we have quarterly board meetings that cover everything   financials  sales  sales pipeline  technology  IP  personnel  operations  risks  goals  etc   We send out a monthly update with a P L  It s an email that s typically about a page long  broken down in categories and bullets so it s easy to skim and I try to include pictures   simply showing the crew working in the field gives insight to what field operations look like  This has been the best thing I have done in regards to shareholder satisfaction  I think they feel more respected and appreciated and it s more fun for them because they get to enjoy the scenery of the ride and the drama of the challenges along with the victories  Some have asked me to provide a shareholders communications workshop for their portfolio companies   I hope to do that some day soon because it s beneficial for everyone   shareholders  entrepreneurs  management  the company  etc   We also send out annual financial statements and annual budget to shareholders   I would suggest the above to others  commit to it at the beginning   because  i  it will increase their comfort in investing to begin with and  ii  it will force you to actually do it  which will be to your benefit   It seems like a lot of work  and it is  but it has paid off in spades  At first it raises lots of questions  which was more time consuming than preparing the updates  After a few rounds  i  you get better at answering questions before they are asked so less questions come in and  ii  they get more comfortable with you and better understand what you re saying so fewer questions come in  They spike again when new investors come in  but then trend back down in a similar manner     What have you learned by not just raising angel money  but working with your angel investors for five years  If you could go back and give yourself one piece of advice on the day you started the company  what would you say   The terms and precedent you set at the beginning will continue in perpetuity  At subsequent financings they will at best stay the same and may get worse  They certainly won t get better  The only way preexisting terms will change is if a big money investor comes in and blows them up  Things might shift then  but they might not get better   Would you raise capital via angels again   Yes  I hope to work with these same angel investors on future ventures   Do you plan to raise institutional capital   At the right time and under the right circumstances  I d consider it  Institutional capital is rocket fuel  so you better be ready to take off  e g   product readiness  operational scalability  sales pipeline  business model proven with repeat sales  etc    For future ventures  if I were to find a VC that does true seed deals  I would certainly consider working with them   What other advice do you have for entrepreneurs trying to raise money   Be honest and do what s right  Follow the golden rule  Treat investors like you would want to be treated  put yourself in their shoes   Business  like life  is a repeat game and you ll have to live with yourself forever   Enjoy this interview  Then you ll probably like my reading

31,training-dataset/business/1326.txt,business,Getting Paid  Compensation Design Best Practices at StartupsBy  Ali Rahimtula  Anthony Tjan  Dick Harrington  Introduction  Few topics are of higher interest and concern amongst startup management teams than compensation  Surprisingly  however  there has been relatively little written on this subject   In early stage startups and venture backed companies  this issue has special significance because cash is scarce  Mistakes early on can doom a startup  As a company evolves  equity becomes more valuable and the design of a compensation scheme needs to become more scientific and thoughtfully planned   Compensation Scheme Goals  A well designed compensation plan can help attract and motivate employees  More specifically  a well designed compensation plan can   Reward performance   Align management and shareholders  i e  motivate management and employees to maximize shareholder value   Attract stronger management and better employees   Retain employees  especially the top performers   Foster longer term thinking   long term greedy  1  mindset    Foster a team oriented culture  where employees across different functional groups will help each other for the good of the company overall   Allow for scalability as the company grows  i e  having a fair and transparent compensation scheme that does not require managers to spend significant time justifying compensation levels to individual direct reports   Scope  This piece will cover compensation design for CEO  top management  and employees  including technical employees   We will not cover salesperson compensation  however  Salesperson compensation is a different beast and best covered in a separate post   Additionally  there are two broad buckets of compensation   1  cash compensation  which can be further broken down into salary and cash bonus  and  2  equity compensation  Cash is a short term incentive  whereas equity is a long term incentive  A properly designed compensation plan requires an understanding of both the short term and long term levers   First we will cover cash compensation  Then we will cover equity compensation  including new hire as well as retention or evergreen grants   Finally  before offering some concluding thoughts  we provide a library of best practices and common mistakes to avoid   Acknowledgements  For this post we have co opted three experts in the field   Sanjeev Dheer  Leslie Brunner  and Jason Kilpela  Sanjeev is the founder and CEO of CENTRL  previously the founder and CEO of CashEdge  and before that a partner at McKinsey   Co  Leslie is President of MiniLuxe and previously led operations and talent management for athenahealth  growing the team from eight people to 4 300  Jason is the VP of Finance and Business Development at Kapost  All three have had very valuable experience on this topic and we are grateful for their insights   CENTRL  MiniLuxe  and Kapost are Cue Ball portfolio companies   Cash Compensation  Cash compensation is comprised of a base cash salary and a variable cash bonus   Cash salary is a relatively straightforward concept  Variable compensation or cash bonuses  on the other hand  are more complex to properly implement  A cash bonus scheme requires a carefully constructed and board approved financial and operating plan for the next year  When used properly  variable cash compensation is a powerful lever to drive behavior that can impact the following year s results   Setting Cash Base and Bonus Levels  Here  the task is to find the market rate for the position and location  i e  San Francisco Bay Area  NYC  and Boston will be higher than other locations  and adjust it from there  Ideally  especially in the early stages  many CEOs try to pay slightly below market rates and try to make up for it on the equity side  i e  convincing candidates that the equity will be valuable   We think this approach makes a lot of sense because it preserves cash  It is also a positive signal that the soon to be employee highly values the future potential value of the company   Cash compensation is best considered holistically  i e  in aggregate with equity compensation  In setting the cash compensation number  there is no standard answer and there is room for tailoring to board objectives and individual management or CEO goals  There is considerable flexibility for management to trade cash compensation if they want more upside via a greater equity grant  Certain CEOs may be cash rich from previous ventures or may simply prefer a higher risk reward profile   For example  I once heard a technology company CEO  who successfully sold his last company  say that his board proposed cash bonus was not particularly effective because his target bonus number was less than the cost of the watch he was wearing  it was an expensive watch    Thoughts on Metrics  There are numerous metrics to choose from  ranging from financial vs  operating metrics and quantitative vs  qualitative ones   Some leading thinkers in this space   for example  Leslie Brunner   believe that paying on purely financial metrics is risky because you lose sight of the longer term health of the company and culture  Additionally  there are leading indicators that deteriorate before financial metrics do  such as employee turnover or other non financial metrics such as NPS score   athenahealth compensates senior management based on eight metrics along what it calls Stability  Performance  Satisfaction  and Financial parameters  as shown below  This is a balanced  holistic approach that still provides a 45  weighting to financial metrics   Generally  for earlier stage companies  it is simpler to use financial metrics or metrics that directly lead to financial performance and are easy to track  such as MRR growth or churn for a SaaS company   For all companies  we prefer quantitative metrics over qualitative ones  because they can be objectively measured and it is possible to manage to them   Cash Bonus Example  Below is an example of how a cash compensation plan for a CEO might work  Note that the specific metrics used will differ by company   There are three steps to determine cash bonus   1  choose the most important metrics  as well as the respective goals and thresholds for each   2  determine the relative weighting for each metric  and  3  determine how each one scales   The CEO s base salary is  125 000 and the target bonus is  125 000 as well   The three most important metrics we want to optimize around are   1  gross new MRR   2  MRR renewal rate  and  3  burn rate    1  Gross new MRR   40  weighting  FY 2017 goal    500 000  Threshold  If below 80  of this amount is reached  no bonus is paid   Bonus amount paid ratably between 80  and 100    Accelerator  Bonus paid at 300  the rate above for amounts achieved over 100  of MRR goal   Example  If a new MRR of  560 000 is reached  the bonus number for this metric would be    125 000   40     50 000 for reaching the goal  plus   60 000  500 000    50 000   300     18 000 for exceeding the target MRR  or  78 000 in total    2  MRR renewal rate   30  weighting  FY2017 goal  92   Threshold  Having an MRR renewal above 88  is considered important for the long term success of the business  Below this number  no bonus is paid for this factor   Bonus scales ratably between 88  and 92  to target bonus   Accelerator  Achieving a retention rate of 100  will earn a bonus of 300  of target  Bonus scales ratably between 92  and 100  retention to this number   The payout for this metric would look like this    3  Burn rate   30  weighting  Target  100k month average net burn for the year   If actual burn rate exceeds this amount by 10   no bonus is paid for this metric   Positive and negative accelerators can be used here but for the sake of simplicity we ll make this a cliff metric that is either hit or not   Putting it all together   If the FY 2017 results were   Gross new MRR    560 000  MRR renewal rate   90   Net Burn    105 000  Cash Bonus    78 000    22 500     125 000   30      138 000  For later stage companies  it is often more appropriate to use simpler financial metrics such as revenue  EBITDA  or free cash flow  For example  it could be a 60  weighting on revenue and 40  on an EBITDA target  with an extra 20  or negative 20  based on a free cash flow target   Occasionally  certain management members may assert that the fairer way to determine compensation is to look at what percentage of the  target number  was reached  We disagree with this approach  Why should a bonus be paid for  achieving  last year s number  At a minimum  the revenue threshold should start at last year s number   For example  if the revenue target is 50  growth over the previous year or  5 000 000  and the company achieves a  4 000 000  they may argue that 80  of the target is achieved  We don t agree with this  We think it makes more sense to be paid ratably between a threshold  say 80 or 90   and 100   and provide a kicker if the revenue target is exceeded  For example  if revenue of only  2 500 000 was achieved  it would make no sense to earn 50  of the bonus for this metric   it should probably be zero   The range of bonus payment relative to base salary can be wide  going from zero to as high as 200  of base  often depending on CEO preference  i e  someone may prefer a lower base in exchange for a higher potential total cash package   In practice  the cash bonus payment as a percentage of target typically ranges from 90  to 120   with 100  being the target if the base plan is achieved  although the range of possible outcomes is much wider   Remember  the base case board plan is intended to be what the team believes can be achieved  not pie in the sky   Another design principle is to only incorporate metrics that the individual has some direct ability to impact  So for example  short term balance sheet metrics  i e  working capital management  are only applicable to the CEO and CFO   Importance of Performance Review 2   A critical component of the variable compensation process is the performance review  A properly executed performance review that has depth and thoughtfulness requires significant time and preparation on the part of the reviewer  The review  and the variable compensation itself  should be objectively determined by looking at performance relative to plan  as explained above   In addition to explaining the logic for the compensation level and providing a sense of transparency and fairness  a properly executed review will allow the opportunity for the employee to improve future performance  Here are some performance review best practices   Andy Grove has a useful best practice  which is to give the written review to the employee shortly before face to face review  If they get it during the review  they are too distracted reading it to pay attention to the discussion  If they get it after  they will not have enough time to think about and digest the feedback   Provide specific  actionable feedback   Be balanced and don t shy away from negative feedback   Objectively assess actual performance output relative to plan   Assess the individual as well as  if applicable  the organization they manage   Concentrate on 2 3 key messages   For under performers  to the extent you want them to remain with the organization  reinforce to them that this process resets every year so everybody has a chance to be successful in the coming year   If allowing for 360 degree feedback  i e  subordinate feedback on their supervisor   separate this session from the subordinate s compensation discussion  do it at a different time    Discourage anonymous feedback  Generally  this is a total waste of time as people try to guess the source  Encourage people to talk about their grievances face to face and try to resolve it in real time   Spend significant effort providing advice for improvement for strong performers  Typically we tend to concentrate our efforts to improve underperformers but given their disproportionate impact on the organization  just as much  if not more effort should be spent on the top performers   Equity Compensation  Equity compensation takes the form of employee stock options or restricted stock units  RSUs   Employee stock options work well for early stage private companies  whereas RSUs are more common in later stage  think  1 billion valuation and up  as well as public companies   Typically  these vest over four years  Investors prefer double trigger acceleration which means that the management team member and employee unvested options will fully vest if both of the following occur   1  sale of company and  2  involuntary termination of employee  Investors don t like single acceleration  specifically triggered upon a sale  given that this makes the company less valuable to a potential acquirer   Early stage technology companies need to make it for stock options to be worth something  This category of compensation is critical to attracting and retaining key employees and also helps long term alignment of management with other equity owners   New Hire Grants 3   For equity compensation  Fred Wilson has an excellent framework for startups that can help determine the amount of equity to grant   The framework is not applicable to co founders or new CEO or COOs that are non founder hires  For these hires  the equity allocation amount is a one off negotiation typically based on ownership points  percentage  of the company  But after the core team is in place  the framework works well and helps migrate the equity allocation process from a percentage mindset to more of a dollar value mindset  In so doing  it has the dual benefit of being less dilutive to founders and also normalizes for different company values  This latter point is important  If a founding CEO has a  points  mindset  i e  market rate for an engineer is 0 5  of the company  for example  this does not take into account the value of the company  Half a percentage point is more valuable for a company worth  100mm than one worth  10mm   Multipliers   Senior management  CFO  CRO  VP Sales  CMO  CTO etc    0 5x Director level  including key engineers   0 25x Employees in key functions  engineering  product  marketing  etc    0 1x Other employees  0 05x  The amount of equity to grant follows this formula   Shares granted    Base salary   Multiplier     Most recent market valuation for company equity   fully diluted shares   So  for example  for a CMO with a market rate base salary of  150 000  a post money valuation on a recent financing round of  40 000 000  and 20 000 000 fully diluted shares outstanding  the number of options granted would be     150 000   0 5x      40 000 000   20 000 000     75 000    2 00    37 500  If granted in the form of stock options  the grant would be struck at the most recent 409 a  price  most typically with a four year vesting period  with a one year cliff and monthly vesting thereafter   Additionally  it is worth noting that if the company performs according to plan  we would expect the value of the grant to be several fold more valuable than  75 000   Evergreen Grants   Increasing Retention 4   One of the most important features of equity compensation is that it is a means to improve retention of top performing employees  Obviously  the most significant factor in retention is the trajectory of the company  A rocket ship will have more success retaining top employees than a company that is struggling  But normalizing for this  a properly structured grant scheme around retention  strong performance  and promotion can decrease turnover significantly   The problem of retention   where the average tenure of an engineer at a US based venture backed company is about two years   has become more acute of late  because length of time to achieve an exit  either via M A or IPO  is increasing  As the data below 5  shows  the median time from founding to exit has increased by 2 years or 50  from 2000 to 2015   The best framework I have seen for ongoing or evergreen retention grants is from Andy Rachleff  the founder of Wealthfront  also called the Wealthfront scheme    Rachleff notes that there are four cases upon which new equity grants should be provided   New Hires   this is described above in the previous section  Promotions   the size of the grant here will bridge the difference between the size of grant for a new hire at this position at the market rate and what they have been granted  Outstanding Performance   these are annual grants for non management Typically these would be awarded to the top 10 to 20  of the employee base and would be in an amount equal to 50  of the grant size were they hired as a new employee today  Evergreen   Applicable for all employees  these should start 2 to 2 5 years from the employee s start date  and then continue each subsequent year  Each annual evergreen grant should equal 25  of the four year market grant they would get if hired today at this level   For 2 4  the grant vesting is spread out over four years  same as the new hire grant   however there is no need to do cliff in the first year  vesting can be monthly or quarterly from the grant date    The critical insight here with  4   the evergreen grant   is to provide the grant at 2   2 5 years into the original four year vesting cycle  This allows employees to always have a significant amount of unvested equity  The benefit is to effectively nip the urge to look around for new job opportunities in the bud  We encourage companies to be transparent about their evergreen equity grant program so that employees build this into their compensation expectations and mindset   The dilution with this scheme is about 3 5   5  per year  not counting additional new executive hiring   This is on average about 75bps more dilutive per year than a more conservative scheme that does not use this model  This incremental dilution is  we believe  dramatically outweighed by the benefit of better retention of top performing employees   For numbers 2 4  the size of the grant can be determined using the methodology of the previous section   Library of Compensation Best Practices  Plan Upfront  It Will Pay Off Later   A clear philosophy and a significant amount of planning are required to design an effective startup compensation scheme   You need to consider the team required to successfully pursue the opportunity  You need to also consider the composition and organization of the team across function  product  engineering  sales marketing  customer service support  finance  etc   and across different levels of management that you feel is required  This is important because you have finite bucket of cash and stock to apportion and you have to think hard about which people are right for the company   With respect to this planning process  we suggest starting with the senior leadership team you want on board first  Additionally  for the senior management team we have seen it be effective to pay the same base cash compensation but allocate different option levels  based on importance to the company and when they come on board    The table below is an example of a budgeting exercise for options  At the bottom you can see how much of the current option pool is unallocated   a key metric to keep in mind during the planning process   Look at Compensation in Aggregate  When evaluating any particular component of compensation  i e  cash bonus levels or equity grant amounts for the next year   it is useful to look at all components of compensation in aggregate  It is difficult to opine on a cash bonus  for example  without knowing the amount and value of equity they have been granted  An example from one of our portfolio that provides a good composite view  numbers altered  is below   Be Unapologetic about Variable Compensation and Compensation Tied to Company Performance  Our recruiting philosophy for early stage companies is that candidates have to buy into the true essence of what you are doing   and that includes the risk reward proposition   This implies middle of the road or slightly below market base cash compensation and a fair amount of upside via options allocations if you do well  If the potential hire is not comfortable with this  they are not aligned with what you are trying to accomplish   We are big fans of rewarding people on variable compensation  bonus and equity  at VC backed companies  It sends the right message to the right candidates that a dynamic technology startup wants to attract   Be unapologetic about it  There is risk involved  If they don t want to be risk takers then they are probably not right for this stage of company   Tie Variable Compensation to the Board Plan  The implementation of a variable compensation scheme often provides the opportunity to create a thoughtful and reasonable financial plan  not low ball  not pie in sky  for the coming year  One of the most significant benefits of a variable compensation scheme is that it provides a lever to incent management to adhere to it  This means not paying your management team by default if all of a sudden the business is going sideways  Additionally  this is important because you don t want to have several miscellaneous plans   rather you want one plan with everyone rolling in the same direction   The short term  usually annual  plan has to be aligned with the budgeted operating and financial goals that the management team has to accomplish this year  It should include the most important criteria you want to hit  and may cover  for example  revenue growth  operating income  cash flow  or other financial or operating metrics  see above    Timeliness of the board plan is important here  We consider it best practice to approve the board plan in January  assuming the company has a calendar year   It is not uncommon for some startups to wait until later in the year to get their board plan approved  When this happens  it may be the case that the board plan is no longer relevant for the year  either because it is clear at that point that the company will not achieve its numbers or the reverse  More importantly  it makes it difficult for the management team to work towards achieving these goals if it is not clearly decided and communicated at the beginning of the year  One argument sometimes made to justify a delay in the adoption of the board plan is that the previous year has not yet been formally closed  In this case we recommend using the provisional financials from the past year from which to build the plan  they should not change much and presumably 10 12 or 11 12 of the year s financials will have been scrubbed so there is not that much uncertainty    Simple is Better  We would recommend making the short term plan as simple as possible   too many individual activities create a dynamic that is too complicated and hard to manage  Everybody should understand the drivers  For example  a 20 point short term plan with a 5  weighting on each is hard to measure and more importantly hard for your management team to focus on   Quantitative Metrics are Better than Qualitative Ones  When it comes to the specific metrics upon which to determine the level of discretionary compensation  we prefer quantitative metrics over qualitative ones  Quantitative metrics are objective and clearer to monitor as a benchmark for management teams to accomplish  Remember  the board always has the ability to grant additional bonus if some qualitative metric is achieved   Be Transparent  While confidentiality around compensation in theory has certain benefits  the reality is that you have to assume that employees talk and exchange compensation details   Transparency and consistency in setting compensation levels create several benefits   It creates clarity that promotes an environment of fairness that helps employees feel secure  It avoids misunderstanding relative to what someone signed up for  It eases feelings of insecurity   It obviates the need for many CEO conversations with employees  It saves a lot of time and therefore allows for scalability as the organization grows   Transparency fosters an atmosphere of togetherness  We all know the budget and we all know the plan we have to accomplish together   When athenahealth  a pioneer in this area  experimented with compensation transparency  they published compensation ranges  including cash bonus level  for every position at the company  They were consistent all the way down from CEO to front line employees  They found it to be powerful for employees and also it helped them scale   Biggest Compensation Mistakes to Avoid  Too desperate to hire a certain employee and using salary to attract them  A recruiter for a startup needs to be really good at selling the dream  Companies need to believe in what they have  Not everybody buys the dream and that s ok  Don t immediately fall to comp as the answer  Startup life can be terrifying at times and the people you hire need to have grit and heart and understand the long term potential of the business   Having a plan that is 100  weighted on operating income  For later stage companies this is a mistake because it is possible to achieve this largely by cutting costs  even if you fail to grow revenue   In this case  the company can lose momentum on driving growth  In general  it is better to have a more balanced operating plan  such as to include both top line growth and operating income or cash burn  to award variable compensation   Burning too much cash on compensation early on  If an early stage company overpays with stock  you can recover from that  Burning too much cash  on the other hand  can sometimes be fatal for early stage startups   Over hiring junior employees  A trap that startups sometimes fall into is to hire low paid junior employees because each will cost you less than hiring the right skilled person  A lot of busy work can be done at startups if this happens  Compensation per employee may be low but you do not get productivity  We have seen this sometimes manifested with overseas development offices   Being too stingy with compensation  For certain key employees  there is a cash compensation level below which it is a strain for the employee to make it work  While they may want to join the company  coming on board below that threshold is a recipe for failure  Often it is an employee with a young family in a geography with a high cost of living  In the compensation negotiation they are usually focused on an absolute compensation level versus a relative one  In these cases  there simply is not much room to cut below market rates  If you do  you won t get them  larger companies will pay and get them   You don t need to hire a lot of people  Be very clear on the number you require and if need be  pay close to market rates to get the right people   Falling into trap of title inflation  Titles are free  Why not give out inflated titles if it saves cash and or equity   We don t agree with this approach   First  as a practical matter  with title inflation  you will eventually run out of grades  If I m a SVP   what do I do next  EVP  At a startup  this level of complexity is silly and confusing   More importantly  it distracts employees from focusing on the company as a whole  People will ask why you promoted someone when their job is not changing  It creates unnecessary stress  and it introduces politics into the day to day discourse   A flatter organization at a startup is more amenable to creating a culture focused on deliverables   Not fairly rewarding contributions for a sales win  In a small company  many team members help to win a deal  Problems often arise when everybody knows that a salesperson got a ton of money but the broader team instrumental in the sale got nothing  The problem is compounded when the next deal comes around   and this team is less inclined to help  This problem can be alleviated by specifically recognizing and rewarding non salesperson contributions to the sales process   Not properly explaining how the equity compensation works  especially for employees joining from more institutional settings  Often  when startups hire people from large companies and they take a cash compensation cut in exchange for a larger potential equity gain  they don t truly understand the risk they are taking  They can often be uneducated about the mechanics and potential value of equity compensation in a base case outcome  An accurate and transparent understanding can prevent an ugly situation in the future   Closing Thoughts  How Structure Evolves with Company Stage in Lifecycle  While certain best practices are constant throughout any company stage  we have noticed that certain changes of approach are appropriate as a company matures   The composition of employees that get equity changes  One question that we often get asked is if everyone at the company should get equity  In the earlier days when the team is small and there is considerable risk  it is ok to offer equity to every employee  Partly  this is due to the fact that cash is scarce but also it can be good from a cultural perspective to give every employee some degree of ownership  As a company matures  however  equity should generally be limited to those that can have an impact on the company trajectory or position in the marketplace  For example  every software engineer should get equity because of their importance  and also their demand in the marketplace  but a receptionist may not   From cash scarcity to equity scarcity  At the pre  and early revenue stage  cash is scarce  At this point  companies generally attempt to manage cash burn and it is appropriate to try to pay less total cash compensation and be more generous on the equity side  As a company matures  generates revenue and raises larger funding rounds  dilution becomes more of an issue and the company can afford to pay higher or even market cash salaries and bonuses but the equity grants will be smaller   Escape  percentage  syndrome  For most companies  it will make sense to move from a  points  to a  dollar  mentality for most employee hires  In the early days of a company   the first few hires such as technical co founder or for major hires such as a CEO or COO  it is appropriate to think about equity grants on a percentage or points basis  As we alluded to above  however  once the core team is in place it is appropriate and less dilutive to think about equity grants in terms of dollar value   A well constructed cash and equity compensation plan takes a lot of thought but pays significant dividends and will help your company be more successful  We hope this piece helps you design the right plan for your startup   End Notes    1  Term coined by Goldman Sachs  Gustave Levy    2  A number of ideas in the review section come from Andy Grove s book  High Output Management     3  The

Brandery  a nationally ranked accelerator program based in Cincinnati  He is also a Partner in the venture capital group at Taft Stettinius and Hollister  LLP  a tier 1 venture capital law firm per U S  News and Best Lawyers    Applications for The Brandery s 2016 Class are open until April 29th  Find more information at brandery org   With articles like  Silicon Valley Unicorns Are Becoming Endangered Species  and  Trouble for Tech Unicorns   there is a lot of uncertainty about what the future holds for the venture ecosystem in 2016  Prolific lions  both in terms of verbiage and investment activity  like Mark Suster have advised    i f you believe the outlook will make funding more difficult  in time and price  you owe it to yourself to keep your burn rate in check so you can last longer until you need money   These market forces seem to be suggesting to start up CEOs that they should take as much capital as they can  even if it is from less than ideal investors   First and foremost  let me remind you that taking money from someone else  whether they are an individual or a GP  is not for the faint of heart  Somewhere in the chain someone earned that dollar  hopefully   and that dollar will be handed to you with the expectation that you may be able to turn it into more dollars  This is quite a burden but also quite a privilege   Further  let me acknowledge  I expect I will get some flak for this article  Naturally  many very good investors do many of the things on the list below  Some investors are so incredibly successful that you may be willing to give a bit more on some of these annoyances   With that  here are some cautionary terms and investors to avoid   1  The expensive term sheet  A lot of term sheets include many hidden costs that are not usually seen as a big deal unless considered in combination  Some examples include key man insurance costs  the costs of completing financials  Board member travel expenses  and ongoing legal fees  Consider the total amount of capital being invested against what you will be spending on these various costs  Here is bit more detail on some of the costs that can make for an expensive term sheet   Legal  It is generally the norm for the start up to pay the lead investor s legal fees  Lawyers  and I understand the irony here as I am a lawyer  do an amazing job of coming in JUST under the cap  so you should consider the cap carefully  Further  you need to be aware of whether the legal costs are limited to the initial closing or if you are signing up to pay for ongoing obligations as well  i e   compensating investor counsel when future rounds are completed    Insurance  Key man insurance is pretty normal for Series A financings  I  generally  do not have great concern with this being included in a large financing  My concern stems from investor requirements that key man insurance extend to several team members  Because premiums must be paid each year for each team member covered  these need to be thought of as annual costs   Financials  This is a tough negotiation point to win because the start up should be vigilant and responsible about maintaining financials  Additionally  some institutional investors may themselves have obligations to deliver certain financials  compiled  reviewed  or audited   That said  sometimes the reporting obligations in the term sheet are so extensive that the start up will spend a fortune completing financials to provide to investors  not to mention the team time spent on reporting    Leases  To be clear  there are circumstances where it makes a lot of sense to shack up with an investor  i e  accelerators  some big institutional funds that provide office space  etc    But  our ears perk up when we hear about an investor requiring the start up sign a  X thousand dollar lease before the financing will close  Any time cash invested goes back out the door and finds its way back into an investor s pocket  we have some concerns   Other Fees  Investors are providing capital to the Company so the Company can use the capital to grow the value of the business  Any term sheet that includes  due diligence fees    pitching fees   or any other fees related to the financing requires some deeper analysis  GPs are compensated to find deals  the start up should not be paying to be found   2  The Non lead lead investors  In a market where start ups frequently hear   come back to us with terms once you have found a lead   it is easy to treat a non lead investor like a lead  But  if the capital invested is not at the lead investment level  three main issues could arise   1  later investors may seek to renegotiate   2  the power terms of the term sheet will likely provide the synthetic  lead  with disproportionate power not linked to their capital commitment  and  3  if the documents require consent from the investors for future matters  as is common  this pseudo lead will not own enough to make up a big chunk of the majority   3  Providers babysitting you  We ve seen investors require that the start up hire an investor approved accounting firm or even mandatorily require the Company use the investor s accountants  Naturally this raises some concern if the investor can willy nilly reject the Company s accountants  Further  does this mean the investor would have undue sway with the accountants preparing the Company s books and records   4  BIG option pool and arduous vesting requirements  We ve seen term sheets that require start ups to have 25  option pools or out of market vesting terms  stick to 4 year vest  1 year cliff   While it is more than likely the start up should have an option pool of some size  it should be consistent with the start up s hiring plan  If the pool is too large or they impose out of market vesting provisions  the investor is teeing up the founders to lose motivation  If an investor suggests   it s all good  if need be  we can award a big chunk of the pool to you   keep in mind that options and restricted stock awarded later will not be as good as the equity you already possess  in terms of exercise price or basis    5  Odd Non Dilutive Language  Only in rare circumstances should there be a security that protects an investor from dilution  For the sake of clarity  I am not referring to the anti dilution language specific to down rounds  I am also not focused on preemptive rights that give the investor the right to invest additional capital at a future round  My comment here is focused on investors that invest but require that they not face dilution in the next round or other future rounds  This is just out of market and could cause problems in the future   6  The JV Board member  We re seeing this more than I d like recently as some fund leaders begin to look to retirement and succession  While I m all for getting younger members at funds experience serving on Boards  you want to be sure that your Board has the right investor representative serving  By way of example  one Company we work with had a junior member of the investment fund serving on its Board of Directors  The investor s Board representative did not have enough power at the fund to push his agenda  While Board representative selection usually occurs post closing  make sure you are on the same page with the investor prior to closing   7  Options for everyone  This one has led to some extensive debates  If the investor s Board representative requires additional equity for his or her service  there should be some hesitation to proceed  The investor s Board representative is already compensated for their Board service  in fact  it is their duty as a GP to serve on the Board  to the extent they have that right   Further  is the equity required to be awarded to the individual or to the investor entity  I m particularly concerned when it is required to be awarded directly to the individual  It just isn t the norm   8  Slow drip funding tranches  We see this more frequently in the current market  Investors pledge a big investment but then tranche it based on milestones  This is concerning for a variety of reasons  namely   1  it is really hard to write objective milestones that don t leave the door open for later debate about whether they were reached   2  the start up doesn t have the security to hire and operate like the full round was closed  and  3  it functionally freezes the start up valuation over a long period of time  Start ups need to know the capital will be there when they need it to hire the best team members they can and the slow drip investment technique makes this difficult to do   9  The small dollar investor with large dollar appetites  We could do an article on this item in and of itself  Try to avoid having too many small dollar investors  As you ve heard  the smallest dollar investors tend to be the most annoying  this is a hard and fast truth   We could provide several legal arguments against including many small dollar investors as well  but just trust the old adage,"[33 1015 1 1363 545 842 1238 29 1044 1317 848]"

done bookkeeping or contract negotiation before  You might be used to working in companies with processes and people in place to support your work  Don t worry  Every skill involved in running a business is learnable  including by you  specifically   Atlas exists to help entrepreneurs worldwide start  run  and grow internet businesses  We put together this guide to cover many of the details you ll need for your business in its first year  We re writing primarily from the perspective of U S  companies it s most relevant to Atlas customers  all of whom have U S  companies  and helps keep our scope manageable  Hopefully this helps to demystify some of these concepts and free you up to go back to creating value and finding customers for it   Our friends at PwC and Orrick contributed their expertise to parts of this guide  That said  to the extent we cover accounting and legal topics  this is information rather than advice  Please use it as a pointer to know what topics to cover when you discuss the matter with your professional advisors  We are not lawyers or accountants  and we re not your lawyers or accountants   Companies incorporating through Atlas get a consultation with accountants and lawyers included as part of the offering    We intend to add to this guide over time  Drop us a line at atlas stripe com if there is any topic you d like us to cover   Incorporation  A business typically exists as soon as the person engaging in the activity says it does  The label business is simply a statement about intent  if you intend an activity to make money by providing goods or services to customers  congratulations  that activity is a business   A company  on the other hand  is a particular operating structure registered in some jurisdiction  They come with substantial rights and responsibilities   Many entrepreneurs wonder whether their businesses should become companies  via a process called  incorporation   and  if so  when  and what form of company  We ve written a quick guide to explain this   Orrick  the global tech law firm  is the legal partner for Stripe Atlas  Experts at Orrick contributed their expertise to this section  see disclaimer   and Atlas users can access a more detailed Atlas Legal Guide written by Orrick   What is the alternative to incorporation   By default  a business has no existence apart from its owners  This is called a sole proprietorship  sometimes called a sole trader outside of the U S   if it has only one owner or a partnership if it has multiple owners   Sole proprietorships are extremely common  the Internal Revenue Service  the U S  taxation agency  is aware of approximately 27 million of these informally organized businesses  compared to approximately 6 million formally incorporated businesses   This is broadly true across most countries which have a distinction between sole proprietors and corporations   Why incorporate   So why incorporate if 80   of entrepreneurs do not  To quote the Orrick Legal Guide for Stripe Atlas   The primary reasons for selecting a corporate form is for the limited liability and perpetual existence that these organizations can provide because once a company is formed  it is regarded as a separate legal entity from its owners  Sole proprietors and partnerships are usually personally liable for the debts and obligations of their businesses and the businesses cease upon the death or departure of the principals   Incorporation is primarily about risk reduction for all parties in an enterprise   Incorporation clarifies the ownership interests of entrepreneurs  investors  and employees  allowing everyone to be confident that they are receiving the deal which they believed they bargained their money labor for  Incorporation moves liability for debts and obligations of the business from the entrepreneurs into the company itself   since the law recognizes it as a separate entity from its owners  Incorporation turns a business from a concept into a thing  that thing can be owned  bought  sold  borrowed against  destroyed  etc   like any other property  Incorporation sends a signal to customers  partners  and the rest of the world that the business intends to operate in a professional manner  The chief reason many entrepreneurs choose to not incorporate is that running a real business is complicated and expensive  A sole proprietorship exists as soon as you say it does  It can stop existing almost as quickly  A company  on the other hand  is like a puppy  owning it obligates you to expensive upkeep  even when you are tired of it chewing on the furniture   When to incorporate   Whether to incorporate one s business or not is a decision to make carefully after talking to one s professional advisors  such as a lawyer or accountant  Some factors which typically counsel incorporation are   Incorporate immediately if you re told to by professional advisors  Some businesses are  by their nature  so exposed to liability that they should almost always be operated as an incorporated entity  Your lawyer and or accountant can  given a brief description of your business  likely give you their considered opinion on whether your industry or business model strongly warrants incorporation   Your lawyer or accountant might also advise incorporation as a proactive measure if you have substantial assets outside of the business  such as e g  other business interests or a house  which should be protected from debts liabilities attached to the business   Incorporate if you want to share ownership with anyone else  Unincorporated partnerships can exist  That said  they have some drawbacks compared with incorporated partnership structures  like limited liability companies  LLCs   Most entrepreneurs with partners choose to have an LLC or corporation   Partnerships are extraordinarily customizable with regards to who is contributing what and who ends up owning what as a result of the partnership  This customizability can be extremely complicated  and making sure the agreement is fair to all parties  and appropriately de risked  can run up a large tab for professional services  It is possible you can economize on costs and complexity by adopting a variant of an LLC or corporation   An unfortunate fact of starting businesses is every relationship will eventually come to an end  LLCs and corporations have well established mechanisms for removing a partner or winding down entirely  Ad hoc partnerships often don t  adding additional headaches  expense  and legal risk to an outcome which is likely already an unhappy one for all involved  You can avoid heartache during the dissolution of your ad hoc partnership by formalizing the partnership early   The legal name for an ownership interest in a company is equity  There exist a variety of ways to grant it  These implicate an existing legal infrastructure which dates back hundreds of years  Holders of equity have predictable rights which they can reasonably assume will be enforced  this is part of what makes equity in a successful business so valuable   Most founders who want to share ownership of a business with employees or advisors  even if they re not full partners   choose to grant equity via a well defined instrument in an entity rather than having poorly specified  informal agreements that come back to bite you later   Incorporate when you anticipate taking investment  Sophisticated investors want to know that  in return for their investment  they will share in the economic proceeds of the business as agreed  This is much easier to guarantee for corporate entities than for unincorporated businesses  we have centuries of practice in accounting for how much money companies make  apportioning varying amounts of control over their operations  and handling disputes in interpretation regarding agreements made about them   Most serious investors prefer to invest in a corporate entity rather than an unincorporated entity  The exact timing of incorporation depends on the particular deal and investor  sometimes the deal is struck in principle before incorporation and formalized with the newly incorporated company  usually the company being formed is a prerequisite to having the deal   Incorporate before hiring a full time employee  There are many  many ways that businesses are regulated  One of the most detailed and complicated ways is in their interactions with employees  due to the social importance of the employment relationship  Accordingly  bringing on your first employee causes a quantum leap in the level of sophistication that you have to bring to running your business and to the potential downside risk of being non compliant   Additionally  your business may be responsible in some circumstances for that employee s actions  If you have not incorporated  the business does not have a separate identity than you personally  so you personally might be forced to pay for their mistakes   Incorporate as your business approaches material size or complexity  As businesses grow  they tend to get more complicated and to accrete more sources of risk  You re shipping more products to more customers  Your services start getting sold to more sophisticated customers  who have more to lose if you break things and more propensity to sue when things get broken  You attract the attention of bad actors   Incorporation can help limit your personal exposure to risks which that might properly belong to the business you re running   What  material size  means to you is a great question to run by your accountant  but as a guideline  in the United States  many businesses with revenue above  100 000 choose to incorporate   What types of companies are there   Companies  in the United States  are regulated at the state level  not at the federal  national government  level  The laws of the 50 states generally provide for limited liability companies  LLCs   corporations  generally referred to as  C corps    and a few more exotic options which are not relevant to most people running internet companies   Should I have a C corporation   Most companies that seek to raise investment from investors in the United States choose to have a C corporation  specifically  a Delaware C corporation  It is the overwhelming choice of technology companies and their investors over 90  of IPOs in the US from 2007 through 2014 were of Delaware C corporations  see here  page 8   If you have another type of entity  your investors may ask you to dissolve it or convert it into a Delaware C corporation as a condition of  or pre requisite to  investing  which can be needlessly costly   Why do venture capital investors overwhelmingly prefer to invest in Delaware C corporations  Quoting the Orrick Legal Guide for Stripe Atlas   Forming your company in Delaware is easiest and most efficient  Delaware is the state of incorporation for more than 60  of Fortune 500 companies  Delaware has an established body of laws governing corporations  it s the only state to have a separate business court system  the Court of Chancery   This is meaningful to entrepreneurs for two reasons  First  there is a long established body of laws relevant to corporations that has been tested in the Delaware courts over many years  In the event of any legal action  therefore  there is a high degree of predictability  Second  Delaware has a long record of pro management decisions  Venture capitalists  VCs  feel more at ease when they see that a company is incorporated in Delaware because it is familiar to them   Should I have an LLC   LLCs have a few advantages over C corporations   They cost less to incorporate  They re generally easier to incorporate and administer in an ongoing fashion  They offer pass through taxation  which may be more tax efficient in some circumstances  particularly for smaller firms  Many solo entrepreneurs  consultants  or folks doing freelance work choose LLCs for these reasons  It is far less common to see high growth technology companies choose to organize as LLCs those companies usually choose to take investment at some point  at which point they typically will be forced by investors to become C corporations   Stripe Atlas does not  at present  offer incorporation of LLCs  Stripe will be adding support for LLCs in the future  If you d like to incorporate as an LLC  email atlas stripe com to be notified when we add this ability   Is one type of corporation more a  real business  than the other   This is an excellent question for many of our international entrepreneurs  since in some countries some classes of corporation are treated as second class corporate citizens  This is not widely true in the United States  Companies are happy to deal with both C corporations and LLCs  Individual consumers largely do not particularly understand the difference  Both are well understood  supported options for interacting with the government   I ve heard of S corporations   An S corporation is not a separate type of company  It is a particular way to elect  ask the IRS for  the pass through tax treatment of LLCs with the corporate form of a C corporation  The IRS covers the topic in more detail here  We ll cover S corporations in more detail at a later date   Who can incorporate companies   Substantially anyone can incorporate a U S  company and own all of its equity interests  You do not have to be a U S  resident or U S  citizen  A foreign company can incorporate and wholly own a U S  company  Misconceptions about this are common  but the Orrick Legal Guide for Stripe Atlas is clear   There are no U S  federal or state laws that require a stockholder or LLC member to be a U S  citizen or permanent resident to form a U S  company  Non U S  nationals can own all of the shares of a U S  corporation or be the sole members of a U S  LLC  Nor must a member of the corporation s Board of Directors or corporate officers own any shares  like  directors  qualifying shares    Similarly  all of the members of the U S  corporation s Board of Directors and all of its officers can  if so desired  be non U S  nationals and U S  non residents   There exist millions of U S  corporations which are directly controlled by people outside the United States  including many people corporations who are not U S  citizens  This is considered a normal business practice the United States does an incredible amount of business internationally  which requires foreigners to be able to transact business in the United States  and when they do so it is often most convenient for them to transact as U S  entities  People routinely incorporate U S  companies for projects as simple as owning a flat or a condominium   Corporations owned by foreign residents or non citizens are still corporations   Bookkeeping and accounting  If you re getting paid  congratulations  You ve created something that people wanted enough to trade money for  To make sure your business stays healthy  and help you focus more on the business than on keeping the lights on  you will want to keep records of money moving in and out of your business  Welcome to the fascinating world of bookkeeping and accounting   PwC  one of the world s leading accounting firms  is the tax and accounting partner for Stripe Atlas  Some of this chapter is based upon a more detailed Atlas Tax Guide written by PwC  which Atlas users can access   What is bookkeeping  What is accounting   Historically  there was a distinction between the functions of bookkeeping and accounting  but the distinction is weakening as more of both functions are done by computers rather than people   Bookkeeping is recording details about transactions to the books  ledgers  of the company  It has historically been seen to be work done by detail oriented specialists  but not something which required a higher degree   Accounting turns the data from books into conclusions about the health of the business  Some of this function has largely been subsumed by computer programs given that the books of the business are computerized  calculating e g  a balance sheet  a report listing the present assets and liabilities of the business  is trivial   In most businesses  accountants advise about the structure of the business  for example  how funds flow between a parent corporation and a subsidiary   design procedures and controls for novel transactions which are more complicated than the routine work handled by bookkeepers computers  and advise the business  owners managers on financial topics  They also often help with tax planning and preparing tax returns   What are  books    Your business keeps many types of records  One category of these  which describes the movement of value into and out of the business  is called  books   The books track value  not necessarily always money  but for convenience s sake we ll talk about money rather than the long list of valuable things a business can keep records about   The physical manifestation of the  books  is different at every business at some businesses it is a literal book with a physical ledger of transactions  at others it is an Excel file  at others it is distributed among multiple different accounting systems   Each entry in a ledger has an amount  a description  a date  and some notion of where the money is coming from and where it is going to  You can think of your checkbook or bank statement as a ledger  though a very simple one relative to one your business is likely to have   Most businesses use double entry bookkeeping  where the business keeps multiple logical ledgers  each representing an account of the business   Accounts  here could correspond to actual bank accounts or to something which is useful to think about but which doesn t have a physical place of its own  like  revenue   Double entry bookkeeping has every transaction recorded twice  as a credit to one account and a debit to another   Double entry bookkeeping was a revolutionary technology back in the 1400s  because it makes errors and malfeasance less likely than using a single ledger for the business  These days computers do most of the actual work  so the business owner can probably avoid thinking about the logistics of bookkeeping that frequently and instead focus on making good decisions about the outputs from the bookkeeping accounting processes   Separating one s financial lives  One of the first steps to take for establishing proper accounting controls on your business is to separate your personal life from your business life  This is often difficult early  as many entrepreneurs start by operating the business as an extension of their personal identity  That is natural and expected  but as early as feasible  you should make a clear division between money inside the business and money outside the business   This has a few benefits   One of the easiest ways for creditors of a company  or others with claims against it  to  pierce the corporate veil  is to demonstrate that the company was not a bonafide business but rather treated like just a separate pocket for the entrepreneur   Piercing the corporate veil  is legal jargon for voiding the presumption of that the liabilities of the corporation rest solely with the corporation and not its owners  As the owner of a company  you urgently want to avoid this happening   Paying personal expenses out of the corporate accounts or corporate expenses out of your personal accounts tends to demonstrate that the company is just a fiction  Since entrepreneurs who incorporate want  and should benefit from  the limitation on liability offered by incorporation  they should be careful to maintain the distinction   Additionally  it is just operationally easier if your business transactions and personal transactions stay in separate accounts  You have no particular obligation to keep accurate books for yourself  but you do for your business  If every transaction on a credit card is known to be business related  that makes your bookkeeping easier  if you know with certainty that none are business related  then you can throw away that statement without consequence for the business   Enforcing discipline on movement of money between the corporation and yourself can help surface issues before they re unsolvable  Businesses are complicated  even small businesses can easily have hundreds of transactions in a month  It is very easy to have the inaccurate perception that one s business is doing well while it is actually bleeding money  This can happen if you have money coming in and out of your personal accounts all the time  and you might not realize it unless you pay very close attention to how often you are personally incurring business expenses  This happens to even very talented entrepreneurs  and it can be a painful realization to wake up to   Internet businesses are  happily  very well positioned to separate from your personal finances  because of how much of the business takes place electronically  If you remember a few simple rules  your business will default to doing the right thing  Let s walk through how you should handle some of the most common transactions   Ways to simplify bookkeeping  Revenue  Open a business checking account as the primary holding place for money for the business  Make sure that all revenue for the business is deposited into that checking account  For example  have Stripe  or your other credit card processor  send funds to that account  If you receive checks  deposit them into the account  rather than cashing them    Doing this will allow you  or your bookkeepers  to quickly scan deposits into the business  which will almost all be revenue items  and match them against your sales   Non revenue deposits  Money occasionally moves into businesses for reasons other than  a customer paid it to you   Prominent examples include investment  entrepreneurs loaning money to the business  etc  You should keep these transactions as infrequent as possible and document them appropriately   Early in the life of the business  when it is not yet cash flow positive  an entrepreneur will often need to inject money into it  This is fine  assuming you can afford it  but  arrange for this to be as infrequent as possible  Monthly is a good cadence for this  multiple times a week is not   Expenses  Open one or a small number of credit cards  These can be in your personal name or in the name of the business business credit cards are often difficult to qualify for early in the life of your business  Put all business expenses on a credit card where possible  never put a personal expense on the business credit cards   Don t make transactions which are mixed in character  they re painful for bookkeeping later  If you need to make a purchase from Amazon with business related items and unrelated items  make two purchases instead  It may cost you a bit of extra shipping  or extra SaaS accounts  or extra time asking a clerk to ring up two purchases at a store   but you ll save on bookkeeping fees and aggravation  There are many places in your business where your personal attention unlocks added value  answering the question  Was this pack of batteries you ordered business or personal   is not one of them  so don t organize the business such that you re routinely asked that question   Pay those credit cards from the business checking account  and only from the business checking account   You should minimize the number of business expenses which occur via any method other than your business credit card  most especially cash transactions  If you need to reimburse yourself or an employee  make sure you keep records of both the expense and the reimbursement   Some government agencies  landlords  etc may only be able to be paid by check  use your online banking to write them checks directly from the business checking account  or use direct debits or ACH payments to pay them   Loans from the business to the entrepreneur  Prefer to avoid making these  Investors hate them because historically they can indicate misuse of company funds  They complicate bookkeeping unnecessarily  They make the story that you and your business are separate a harder one to sell  Ideally  you want flow of cash between the business and yourself to be unidirectional and relatively infrequent  a monthly salary check  a quarterly distribution  etc  These are easy to account for and have clear treatment in terms of tax consequences   Loans get  messy  For example  it is very easy for lax bookkeeping to result in loan repayments to the business being either recorded as entirely revenue  which is incorrect  and increases the business  tax burden unnecessarily  or deemed as revenue by the tax agency  which is incorrect  but might be difficult to defend against given lax bookkeeping    If you need credit  get it from a bank  Paying an 18  APR on a balance averaging  5 000 over the course of a year is a lot less expensive than paying for your accountant to answer the IRS  questions about an informal loan that is lacking in documentation or extensive transactions between the owner and the business   The IRS also has toothy rules about  related party loans   which require more documentation than loans received from banks  If you fail to maintain this documentation  you can be penalized  not because you intended to abuse the loan but simply because you failed to follow the rules about documentation   Speak to your accountant to appropriately document these loans if you choose to make them  Or save yourself the trouble  and just don t borrow money from or lend to your business without careful consideration   Cash accounting vs  accrual accounting  There are two methods of accounting widely used by internet companies  cash accounting and accrual accounting  They result in materially different processes involving bookkeeping accounting and can result in substantial differences in taxes  You ll likely pick one of the two methods and stick with it for years at a time   The two methods imply different ways of keeping the books for your company  you ll also have to tell the IRS which method you were using when you file your first tax returns for the company  Changing methods requires both filing forms with tax agencies and often a lot of internal work to make sure the transition is accounted for correctly  so you ll want to avoid it where you can    In the cash method  your business records revenue as soon as it is  available to you without restriction   This is a term of art from the IRS  a simplified view of it is  If your customer thinks they ve paid you  you ve probably booked revenue in the amount they think they paid you   Revenue which has hit one of your accounts is certainly revenue as of that instant  checks which have been sent to you are revenue as of when they are sent rather than when they are received   Expenses are similarly simple  you book them when they re actually paid   Many entrepreneurs start their businesses using the cash method  as it is very easy to understand  even for entrepreneurs without a business background   The accrual method is more complicated than the cash method  The tradeoff it makes is to allow the business  and other interested parties  to have a more accurate understanding of the true health of the business at any point in time   In the accrual method  both revenue and expenses are recognized once the amount is fixed  known to be  in principle  collectible  and after economic performance has happened   This means that  for example  if you accept funds for an order but have not shipped yet  you do not recognize revenue until you ship   You book an asset for the funds and a liability of unearned revenue representing the obligation of the corporation to ship the equivalent value of goods  you then decrement the liability when you ship and increment revenue   Bookkeeping  easy  once you get the hang of it  but your time is better spent doing almost anything else  so pay someone to do this for you   Many investors will expect to see books done in the accrual method  as there are a variety of ways to report via the cash method which make a business seem to be more successful than it actually is  Switching one s accounting method can be done at the end of a tax period  but is more than a bit of a headache  so if you know you re on the investment track you might want to start with the accrual method to save yourself having to revisit all your books a few months down the road   Substantiation requirements  Your business is required to be able to substantiate  provide documentation about the facts regarding  any transaction on your books  You will want to maintain organized records  in addition to your books  which will let you quickly answer questions asked about any transaction   This is most important for larger transactions or for transactions in a few high risk parts of one s tax return  but in principle  you need to be able to substantiate everything   The IRS does not mandate that you have any particular style of recordkeeping  only that you do it in a consistent manner which lets you comply with your obligations  Internet companies customarily keep most of their records in one or more computer systems  It is important that you know what information is where  that you re able to pull it at will  and that your records are available for the appropriate length of time   In general  this is 3 years after the filing of the tax return for that year  but there are some exceptions  As a practical matter  internet businesses should store substantiating data indefinitely  Hard disk space is practically free  it s certainly cheaper than setting up a process to routinely make the keep or delete decision about particular documents    Substantiating revenue items is fairly easy  keep copies of receipts and invoices   These are described  in detail  in another chapter   If you have particularly large transactions  you probably will want to be able to point to contracts or other documentation attesting to the details of what work was actually performed   Your receipts invoices will generally be centralized by nature in your system  If you happen to migrate systems  remember to save old receipts invoices somewhere that won t get wiped after the migration is over  Organizing them by year minimally  it is often useful to be able to order them within the year  as a common form of inquiry is  Your books show a revenue item for  12 000 on December 3rd  2012  Substantiate it in an appropriate level of detail    Substantiating expense items is modestly trickier  as expenses are typically far more varied than revenue  Additionally  certain flavors of expenses have anomalously detailed recordkeeping requirements   You will want to have a policy that any purchase of goods or services at your company requires a written receipt and or invoice  and that all receipts invoices are kept in a central place  Many companies use receipt tracking or expense tracking software  A lower tech  but still compliant  way to do this is to establish a receipts  email address for your company and require all employees  as a matter of policy  to have receipts either delivered there or to forward receipts there if they are issued one personally   If a transaction doesn t result in a receipt  you should treat that as an anomaly  Part of the discipline of having receipts is to force money moving out of the company to come with documentation justifying it  transactions which do not have receipts are suspicious by nature  and may represent activity that your business wants to clamp down on  like embezzlement  Most of the time the reason is innocuous  but you should still immediately create a written record of the transaction and store it wherever you store receipts invoices   Note that backfilling written records from e g  credit card statements is not acceptable  the IRS wants records to be maintained contemporaneously with the transaction or shortly thereafter  when the details are still fresh and when there is minimal possibility for fudging them for one s tax advantage    Written records don t have to be particularly elaborate for most transactions  particularly small dollar ones  receipts aren t generally that elaborate  either  You ll want to cover who you paid  in an appropriate level of detail  A man  is not appropriate   the flower shop on 3rd street  probably is  at least for a small transaction   exactly how much was paid  the manner of payment  from an account  in cash  etc   what was purchased  and one s rationale for not having a formal receipt invoice   Electronic records count as written records  particularly when you maintain them in an orderly fashion in the ordinary course of business  If it is your business  ordinary practice to keep receipts in the receipts  email inbox  for example  then a two line email to receipts  is a written record created in the ordinary course of business at your company  and it will generally be treated with routine deference   You should keep statements  and similar documents  for all bank accounts  credit cards  etc indefinitely  Note that banks will sometimes retain statements on their own systems for less time than you d like them to be retained make a practice of saving the electronic copies in a place you control  Banks do go out of business occasionally  you don t want to have to reconstruct an account statement from 5 years ago simply because you closed the account or the bank was bought in the interim   Travel  transportation  entertainment  and gift expenses are sometimes abused by some taxpayers and  as a result  have specific recordkeeping requirements  You should be especially careful to keep written contemporaneous records for these transactions  the IRS describes what you need in Publication 463  A preview of coming attractions  you should keep a spreadsheet for each employee which shows any dates of travel  where they stayed  get receipts    and what the business purpose for the travel was  You should  any time you do business entertaining  including meals   record the participants and the specific business purpose contemporaneously with information about the transaction  many small businesses simply write this on the back of the receipt   As with most tax topics  the authorities try to be reasonable about the degree of ceremony required for small transactions  and it goes up as transactions get larger  more frequent  or more material in the total context of your business  It is unlikely that you need to write much more than  Dan Smith  candidate  discussed employment opportunity  if you buy someone  20 worth of lunch  if your end of year party costs your company  150 000  run that by your accountant and ask them what the appropriate level of substantiation is   Business taxes  No business owner particularly likes the amount of work required to calculate taxes  to say nothing of the actual amounts paid   but calculating and paying taxes is both a legal obligation and also a responsibility entrepreneurs undertake in return for the substantial support that society affords us   Beginning entrepreneurs are sometimes excessively scared about the tax liabilities involved in starting a business  We want to demystify them  so that you have a good understanding of what you ll be asked to pay  roughly how much it will end up being  and how to organize your business such that calculating and paying taxes will be as painless as possible   PwC  one of the world s leading accounting firms  is the tax and accounting partner for Stripe Atlas  Some of this chapter is based upon a more detailed Atlas Tax Guide written by PwC  which Atlas users can access   There are many varieties of taxes in the United States and worldwide  This guide covers a subsection of taxes which your U S  corporate entity will likely have to pay  Entrepreneurs or owners of companies may realize income as a result of working for the company  receiving dividends  capital gains  make sure you also handle your personal obligations   As we saw in the chapter on accounting  the entire profession of accounting exists in large part to help you correctly figure what taxes you owe  This brief guide is not a substitute for the professional advice from your accountant  Get an accountant their advice will almost certainly save you money and stress   What is tax planning   Somewhat surprisingly to entrepreneurs  there are often multiple ways to apply tax law to the economic facts of your business  This can result in different amount of taxes  depending on how one applies the law  Accountants help businesses develop a tax position which is both compliant with the law and which is efficient in amount of taxes required   Tax planning often starts well in advance of the tax being due or even the transactions being entered into  For example  given that one wants to award employees equity in the business  to attract desirable employees and reward them appropriately for the hoped for success of the venture   one makes consequential decisions about business structure at incorporation  perhaps even before employing one s first employee  The eventual realization of the value of that equity  and the tax consequences for those future employees  might happen in 5 to 10 years down the road   Tax planning is legal and expected of businesses  As judge Learned Hand wrote in 1934  summarizing centuries of precedent   Anyone may arrange his affairs so that his taxes shall be as low as possible  he is not bound to choose that pattern which best pays the treasury  There is not even a patriotic duty to increase one s taxes  Over and over again the Courts have said that there is nothing sinister in so arranging affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible  Everyone does it  rich and poor alike and all do right  for nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law demands   Tax agencies often  however  take a dim view of abusive tax structuring  where the sole rationale for some action of the business is to avoid taxes  and can impose substantial penalties when it occurs  Tax can be a very complicated subject  which is one more reason to have your accountant and or lawyer review consequential changes to your tax strategy  They can provide you advice on whether you re doing something which is mainstream in your country industry or something which has a higher risk of causing your returns to be judged insufficient by tax agencies you are subject to   Delaware franchise tax  Delaware  like many states  charges all companies incorporated in Delaware a  franchise tax   You can think of the franchise tax as an annual fee to renew the registration of a corporation in some states  the fee is indeed called a fee   Almost all taxes are assessed on revenue or profit  The franchise tax is different  There are two ways to calculate it  both in principle start at a relatively low number and scale with the complexity of the company   You  or your accountant  can calculate your franchise tax in under two minutes  The rules and formulas are on the State of Delaware s website   Companies incorporating with Atlas will generally owe the minimum tax under the Assumed Par Value method  which is presently  350 per year   Franchise tax is due with your Annual Report filing  which you have to do by March 1st of every year  U S  corporate tax returns are generally due on March 15th  assuming your fiscal year is the calendar year   it s generally easiest to file your franchise tax when doing your tax return preparation for the corporate tax return  which  since you re well organized  will be done and ready to go sometime in February   Entrepreneurs can file their own Annual Report and franchise tax relatively easily through Delaware s website  in most cases without requiring professional advice  Your accountant can also do it for you  expect to pay a nominal amount  perhaps  100 or so  for this   Sales tax  Here  Be  Dragons   In the United States  businesses can be required to collect sales tax by their local jurisdiction  city  county  etc  and by their state  This happens in every jurisdiction where the company both a  has a transaction take place and b  has a  nexus  of economic activity   In general  internet companies only have a nexus in locations where they have physical property or employees doing work on their behalf  You may not have a nexus simply by means of incorporating in a state  by having customers in a state  or by having your website be accessible in a state   This is  regrettably  difficult to say with certainty  as some states have been getting more aggressive at claiming that internet activity constitutes a nexus    Accordingly  many internet companies  particularly smaller ones  only charge sales tax on a relatively small percentage of their transactions   You will generally be required to collect the tax from customers  display on each transaction how much tax you are collecting  and remit the tax to the appropriate government agency on a monthly or quarterly basis   Many localities in the U S  also have a  use tax   which corresponds to the sales tax  A use tax is paid by the customer in a transaction  not by the seller customers are supposed to tell the local taxation agency  I am using some property which I purchased outside of this jurisdiction  here s the tax payment   Some people believe that compliance with use taxes is very  very  very low  Nonetheless  you may have a filing requirement if your business has a physical presence in a U S  state check with your local state and or city county   There has been talk for the last several years of instituting a so called  internet sales tax  to make the treatment of internet businesses more predictable  since the current tax regime is very complicated and many larger retailers  who  as a result of their operations  have nexuses in many jurisdictions in the U S   feel like they pay disproportionately high sales taxes while smaller companies  who have very few transactions covered by their nexus  or potentially no nexus at all  pay little to none  This law has not been passed yet  You will likely not have to worry about it until you have  1 million in revenue either way   The complexity of a sales tax filing depends greatly on the specifics of your business  including what you sell  how you record the locations of transactions buyers  how easy it to determine where your business  nexus or nexuses are  and the like  As a rule of thumb  most internet businesses will get their sales tax returns filed by the same accountant who handles their corporate income tax return  It will generally cost a few hundred dollars in professional services fees  but this depends on the complexity of the business   Corporate income tax  Profits of C corporations are taxed at the federal level and at the state level  The main form for the federal return is Form 1120   Some tax returns or government filings are simple enough to do yourself  This is not one of them  While it looks simple  only five pages at first    you should absolutely  positively have a professional tax preparer or accountant involved in the preparation of any corporate tax return  It is relatively easy to make consequential mistakes  and sorting them out will be a distraction from running your business  Additionally  there are a variety of ways to characterize things which are not mistakes per se but which will result in you paying excessive amounts of tax relative to equally valid ways to characterize the same economic facts   Income tax is only levied on income  rather than revenue  Income is  generally speaking  revenue minus expenses  Most things which you purchase on behalf of the corporation  including the salaries of the founding team and employees  can be deducted immediately as expenses   A relatively smaller number of things cannot be expensed but have to be capitalized  their  generally high  upfront cost gets apportioned to the business over the useful life of the thing  This is also referred to as  depreciation  or  amortization   Internet businesses do not typically have high capital expenses early in their lives  particularly as the historic sources of capital expenditures  servers  networking equipment  custom software development  etc  are increasingly rented at need from cloud providers for fairly small  and expensible  sums of money   Your accountant can provide you with authoritative advice on whether any particular expenditure needs to be amortized   If you have a physical presence in a U S  state  your corporation may owe state income taxes in addition to federal income taxes  Your accountant can advise you on whether your company has a filing requirement in the state s  in which it physically exists or does business  and can help you prepare those filings  Some states have been getting more aggressive at claiming that internet activity can  in some circumstances  give rise to a filing requirement   Taxpayer ID numbers  All tax returns are associated with taxpayer identification numbers  There are several varieties of this  The ones you ll see most frequently are   Social Security Numbers  SSNs   U S  citizens and people authorized to work in the U S  are issued a number by the Social Security Administration  This is widely used by governmental agencies and private entities alike to identify them  The SSN is considered very sensitive  because knowing it is often used to authenticate whether someone is a particular person    The general form of a SSN is 123 56 6789   Companies do not have SSNs  You may not have a SSN if you are not a U S  citizen or have not been employed in the U S  before  You will instead provide one of the following when asked   Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers  ITINs   Any natural person  a living  breathing human  who needs to file taxes but cannot receive a SSN  because the SSN typically requires legal right to work in the U S   can ask the IRS for an ITIN  which functions as a substitute SSN  They are not very tricky to get you simply file an W 7 form and wait roughly six weeks   Most owners of Atlas companies will not themselves need an ITIN  your company will file U S  taxes  but you yourself might not have U S  tax filing obligations  If your accountant tells you otherwise  file an W 7 and get one issued  You can also get one issued contemporaneously with any tax filing  submit the tax filing on paper with the ITIN listed as  pending  and include a W 7 form  This generally introduces a delay in the processing of your tax filing  and should be avoided where you can  but it is always better to file in a timely fashion and have the processing delayed than to fail to file or file late   An ITIN looks like a SSN  but the first digit will always be 9   Employer Identification Numbers  EINs   EINs identify corporate persons  i e  companies  not natural persons  actual people   You receive an EIN after filing an SS 4 with the IRS  if you incorporated through Atlas  we took care of this for you   You will routinely be asked for your EIN by financial institutions in the U S   and occasionally by other businesses  It is probably not a good idea to publish it  but they re not treated as sensitive as SSNs are   The disclosure of your SSN to an unauthorized person is an immediate emergency  the disclosure of your company s EIN happens rather routinely    An EIN looks like 12 3456789  Note that this is the same number of digits as a SSN but the hyphen placement is different  It is  unfortunately  not the case that the hyphens don t matter some SSNs have the same numbers in the same order as some EINs  so make sure you re always filling in the right box and including the hyphens in the right spaces   Informational returns  Companies  including your own  have an obligation to report certain transactions to the government via  informational returns   The government matches informational returns against the tax filings of individuals and corporations  to make sure that taxpayers do not forget to pay taxes on income they have received   Your company will routinely issue informational returns  You may occasionally receive them  and so should understand how that process works as well   There are several varieties of informational returns  The two you are most likely to issue are the W 2  which records wage income to an employee  and the 1099 MISC  which shows payment for services to an individual contractor   You will not ordinarily issue a 1099 MISC to a company  even if you buy services from them    Your accountant will take care of filing W 2s and 1099s on your behalf  early in the calendar year  You will provide one copy to the taxpayer you re reporting on  one to the IRS  and keep one for your own records   To issue any informational return  you need someone s tax ID number typically SSN for W 2s and either an SSN  ITIN  or  rarely  an EIN for 1099s  There is a form to formally ask someone s tax ID number  it is the W 9  One only uses the W 9 with U S  taxpayers  if someone is not a U S  person  for example  if you re employing someone overseas   you ll want to get them to give you a W 8BEN instead   This provides a paper trail in the event the IRS asks  Why didn t you file a 1099 for that contractor    They don t have U S  tax liability so we don t have to    Oh really    Here s their W 8BEN    OK then    Because the IRS loves its forms  there is a separate one  the W8 BEN E  for when you need a W8 BEN from a corporate entity   Your company may occasionally be asked for a W 9 or W8 BEN  This could happen if someone believes they need to file  or may need to file  an informational return about you  For example  a financial institution may ask for one of these to open an account  in anticipation of perhaps needing to file a 1099 INT to report interest income at a later date   In some cases  you might be asked for one of these forms by mistake  Some relatively common mistakes   Only U S  persons  including corporations  should be asked for a W 9  If you are not a U S  person  you should be asked for a W8 BEN   Any company incorporated in the U S  is a U S  person  regardless of who owns it  Many Atlas customers have Delaware C corporations whose address and operations are international  these are still U S  persons and hence should only file W 9s not W8 BEN Es   Sometimes individuals at companies ask for these forms when they have no actual need for them  You have no particular obligation to provide them if there is no legal requirement for an informational return  That said  companies have no particular obligation to do business with you  and some companies will request these forms at certain points as a matter of policy  Often the easiest resolution is to say  Can you check with your accountant to see if that is really necessary   You might sensibly decide to simply provide the form  even if not required to   It is generally in your interest to provide W 9s or W8 BENs  A common reason why your counterparty is asking for it is to document their decision to not withhold money on your behalf   If you re unknown to the U S  tax system  they might have a legal obligation to withhold perhaps 30  of your payment and send it to the IRS  The IRS will then wait for you to file a return and perhaps get some of that back  The assumption is that people who are known to the tax system are honest and can be trusted to hold onto their own money before filing a return to determine what portion should be sent to the IRS  A W 9 says  The relevant laws say that the IRS implicitly trusts me  so you have all the legal justification you need to pay me what we ve agreed and not withhold anything     Your company may receive informational returns  The most likely one for Atlas customers is a 1099 K from Stripe  showing revenue from processing credit cards in a year  You don t have to do anything in response to an informational return and you don t have to send it on to the IRS they already received a copy  You ll already have the income shown on the return recorded in your books somewhere  and your books drive your tax return   The scenario where an informational return actually matters is where the return shows a large amount of money and one s corporate tax return doesn t obviously reflect that money on it  This can result in the IRS doing a correspondence audit  basically asking  We know you received  5 000 in interest last year  Where did that show up on your tax return   Since you are a law abiding taxpayer  you ll have a ready answer to that question  and that will be the end of it   Many entrepreneurs believe that informational returns necessarily reflect income  profits  but this is not the case  For example  a 1099 K reflects total volume of payments  which isn t even close to a business  taxable income they still have to pay expenses  etc  The IRS will expect that number to be a subset of one s revenue for the year  and will ask for an explanation if you show  200 000 of credit card payments but only claim  120 000 of revenue   but they don t tax revenue  they tax the profits of the business   What is transfer pricing   Companies are increasingly doing business internationally  and this raises thorny questions on where related parties working in concert are generating the profits in their business and where it should be taxed  This is also true of many Atlas customers  who might have one corporate entity in the U S  and one in their home country   Businesses document movement of money between their own international operations using transfer pricing  a mechanism to describe the internal movements of money  goods  services  and profits between two or more related parties as if they were the  arms length  dealings of unrelated companies   Transfer pricing has developed over the years as companies and tax authorities try to tackle the complexities of international business  It is a tool for taxpayers to consider the best way to allocate that income and for tax authorities to consider if too much or too little has been allocated to a territory  especially when there is a difference in the tax treatment between the territories   Fair prices  The general theory of transfer pricing is that the entities mutually agree on a fair price for goods services moving between them  record their justification  and have the books of the separate entities match this stipulated upon reality and also match the actual flow of funds   In general  market based economies assume that there is no such thing as a  fair price  except in the context of an agreement between a buyer and a seller  How much  should  software cost  Nothing  or  0 99  or a million dollars a year  depending on the agreement between the parties  Authorities treat the choice of a buyer and seller to agree on a price with substantial deference  including in tax matters the IRS will default to assuming that the price of an expense item is reasonable   There is a caveat here which is very important for transfer pricing  we assume that the buyers and sellers in most transactions are doing the transaction because they like the terms of the transaction  not because they have a relationship larger than the transaction  This is called dealing  at arms length   When the buyer and seller are related to each other  for example by being married or by being under common corporate control  the transaction could conceivably be influenced by their desire to not end up sleeping on the couch  Or  more worrisomely from the IRS  perspective  to reduce tax paid   Accordingly  transfer pricing is about documenting  In the hypothetical world where our two companies were not related to each other at all  we could have reasonably agreed to buy this thing because it is valuable  and to pay this amount of money because that is what this thing would cost on the market    Transfer pricing examples  Two examples which are common among Atlas companies   Sales of software through the U S  subsidiary of a foreign company   Suppose we have the founders of a software company which operates in India as a Private Limited Company  PLC   the Indian equivalent of a U S  C corporation  We ll call it server monitoring software  for concreteness   The PLC sells server monitoring software directly to Indian companies  but its software is usable by customers worldwide  They establish a Delaware C corporation as a subsidiary to sell their software to customers worldwide  while they intend the PLC to continue selling to domestic Indian customers   In this case  the ultimate economic goal of the enterprise is to allocate much of the profits to where the value creation happens  which  since the software is actually produced in India  should be India  This will let the Indian PLC pay its expenses  including payroll for the engineering team   compensate the founders  and produce profits which will go to the founders or  likely local  investors  The enterprise accordingly wants to leave an amount in the U S  entity proportionate to the work performed by it   There are a variety of ways to accomplish this  One is by making the U S  entity a reseller of the PLC s software  The company will exhaustively document that they researched reseller arrangements  Let s assume  hypothetically  that the result of this research was that unrelated resellers typically received 20   They will then have the U S  entity sign a formal reseller agreement with the PLC  obligating it to pay 80  of the billings it charges customers for the software that the PLC developed   That fee enters the Indian PLC as revenue  after which it is netted against the expenses  payroll  servers  etc  of the Indian entity and taxed by India   The remaining 20  of sales stay in the U S  corporation  The business applies some of them to the required costs to operate the U S  corporation  such as accounting fees  lawyer fees  for contract negotiation  etc   bank fees  and the like  This will result in the U S  entity earning a modest profit  that profit is taxed by the United States  The post tax profit can be sent to the C corporation s parent company  where it may or may not be taxed  or it can be kept in the U S  for the time being  to be later deployed in e g  expanding the U S  operation  purchasing U S  based assets on the behalf of the U S  company  or similar   Sales of physical products through a U S  company taking investment   Suppose we have founders in Hong Kong who make iPhone cases locally  with the intention of distributing them internationally  They might choose to take investment  If their investors are from Silicon Valley  their investors will likely require them to establish a Delaware C corporation to invest in   In this case  the ultimate goal of the enterprise is to first transfer funds from the United States to Hong Kong  use those funds to establish a manufacturing operation  and then sell the products of their operation through the U S  entity   The first part of this would be the U S  entity contracting with the company in Hong Kong for professional services design  branding  etc  This would provide adequate justification for paying the company enough money to get up and running  This is recorded as revenue by the Hong Kong company and an expense by the U S  company   The operation in Hong Kong then begins producing iPhone cases  It will sell them to the U S  company  which will sell them worldwide  Here  the company would prefer to sell them at the lowest possible price  because that raises the profits of the U S  entity  which will please the U S  investors   but compliance considerations will have them pricing in line with other manufacturers of goods sold at retail in the U S  It could  for example  end up that the wholesale price  paid by the U S  company to Hong Kong company  would be 40  of retail  The company would  again  exhaustively document their rationale for this pricing  and show it on invoices bills of shipping etc between the two companies   This will likely leave the Hong Kong company with a modest profit  from services work and iPhone cases sold wholesale  which gets taxed in Hong Kong   The U S  company will have paid for the services work and wholesale cases  then sold the cases on at a  higher  retail price  through its website or other channel   hopefully earning a profit  The profit is taxed in the U S   after taxes  it is possible that dividends would flow to the investors or owners of the company   Some not so obvious observations here   The company had the choice of selling the cases through the Hong Kong entity or the U S  entity  Why sell through the U S  entity  The primary reason will be that the investors are investing in the hopes of owning the value that the company produces  so the company will organize to keep most value in the U S  entity it will own the brand  designs  and commercial relationships  and  just  have the Hong Kong entity do the actual work on its behalf   Would it be safe to run this example in the other direction  It would be markedly riskier  In general  transfer pricing which functions to recognize revenue in high tax jurisdiction  rather than a low tax jurisdiction  is not scrutinized very closely  Transfer pricing which functions to recognize the revenue in a low tax jurisdiction  on the other hand  more often gets thoroughly investigated  The corporate tax rate in Hong Kong is less than half of the rate in the United States  the IRS  accordingly  might assume that a U S  entity paying a related Hong Kong entity might be doing it for tax optimization purposes rather than for legitimate economic reasons  This doesn t make it impossible  just harder to justify  one of the reasons to have accountants is to get a good sense of what the risk of a given tax position is and then make a business decision on how much to optimize for tax savings versus tax risk   Transfer pricing can get very complicated  particularly as corporate structuring gets more complicated  the types of transactions start getting complicated  multi party multi nation financial transactions are much harder to account for than simply selling an iPhone case   and the size of the business increases   An enterprise doing millions of dollars of revenue will likely need to have their transfer pricing strategy designed or redesigned by accountants specializing in their industry  That said  even smaller businesses should document their transfer pricing position  not having documentation would make it very difficult to avoid penalties if the IRS were to examine you and take issue with your transfer pricing   Enforcement actions disproportionately target larger players  because tax agencies understand that large players are where the money is    This shouldn t scare you the IRS  like most tax agencies  is quite reasonable and simply want to be paid an amount consistent with your responsibilities under the law  If you have a good faith disagreement with the IRS  it will be resolved in the ordinary course of business  by your professional advisors  This is fairly infrequent and overwhelmingly not likely to be the reason one s business fails  concentrate your efforts on making something people love and selling it effectively  You can  and should  hire accountants to worry about these sorts of things for you   Audits   Audits  are a scary word for many entrepreneurs  They shouldn t be   An audit is simply a formal inquiry by a taxation agency into the correctness of information on your tax return  The overwhelming majority of audits are  correspondence audits  the tax agency simply sends you a letter  generally because a computer compared informational returns to your filed tax return and noted a possible discrepancy  Your response to correspondence audits will generally be written by your accountant  but it is likely to be relatively simple   Often  the issue can be explained away in a single paragraph    The IRS will sometimes select returns for more detailed examination  You should absolutely  positively have professional representation if selected for one of these audits  they can be quite stressful and distracting from running the business  even though they are if you are filing accurate returns from a well organized business not an emergency   These audits will generally require an in person visit  either at the IRS  local office or at your office   The IRS maintains offices in U S  embassies worldwide for the purpose of international taxation issues  Their staff are typically small so they have to be very selective in audit activity  but you should nonetheless file accurate returns in a timely fashion    In the event of an audit  your accountant or tax attorney will instruct you as to your response  You should follow their advice to the letter  this is what you re paying them for  Some things which naively might seem like a great idea  like providing the IRS with all financial data from your business  may delay the resolution of the audit or overly complicate things  for example by causing examination of parts of the business that were not originally in the scope of the audit   Audits are rare  particularly of smaller companies  You should know that they are a possibility if you run a business  but they are just that a possibility at a relatively routine encounter between your business and the government  You should treat the possibility like a responsible professional  hire an accountant  file honest returns  retain information in an organized fashion  and spend your time worrying about growing the business rather than worrying about the unlikely event of an audit  Should you actually be audited  you will again treat it like a responsible professional  call in your accountant tax attorney and follow their instructions   Tax is a moving target  Accounting is a deep field  much like software development or marketing  One similarity is that the core of the profession is fundamentally the same from year to year  Another similarity is that things still change  constantly   There is a worldwide interest in tax reform right now  Tax agencies are still wrangling with getting their heads around the internet  and consequential changes affecting the positions of internet businesses could happen at any time   Just like you wouldn t set your marketing or technical strategy once and then forget it  you ll want to work with your tax advisors on  minimally  a yearly basis to ensure that the way you have structured things is still compliant and still in your best interests   Sometimes you ll even get unexpected good news  For example  when the author of this guide started his business  he was double taxed by the social security systems of two countries on the same income  A few years into the business  they signed a Totalization Agreement  which allowed him  and similarly situated businesses  to pay only to the system of their country of residence  This was a material savings  available due to a change in law  which he would have missed had he not routinely reviewed his tax strategy with a professional   Employment  Your business has several forms of leverage available to it  allowing it to create more value  One of the most important is the ability to hire people   Orrick  the global tech law firm  is the legal partner for Stripe Atlas  Experts at Orrick contributed their expertise to this section  see disclaimer   and Atlas users can access a more detailed Atlas Legal Guide written by Orrick   Contractors vs  employees  There is a distinction in U S  employment laws between employees and people who work on behalf of a firm but are not employed by it  This includes freelancers  consultants  and contractors for sake of not repeating ourself  we ll call them contractors below   Employees have their activities at work substantially controlled by the firm  Contractors are operating their own businesses and happen to have the firm as a client of their business  their relationship with the firm is more similar to that of a vendor with their client than an employee with their boss   Many smaller businesses  including internet businesses  would prefer to be able to employ people as contractors because there is less paperwork required than for employees  the direct cost is lower  and it is fractionally easier to get into and out of relationships with contractors  The laws of the United States and individual states have some protections built for employees which do not apply to contractors   Determining if someone is an employee or a contractor  The IRS lists three tests  each of which has several prongs   Unfortunately for entrepreneurs  these tests don t have so called  safe harbors  there is no simple way to say  with certainty  that someone classified as a contractor will certainly be held to be a contractor  The tests are a balancing act the examining official will weigh the different factors against each other to come to a determination  If it is important for you that someone be classified as a contractor  you should know your position on each issue and you should try to have it be overwhelmingly clear  and documented   that the tests consistently point to a contractor relationship   This is a complicated area of law  You should discuss it with your attorney prior to hiring anyone   How do I employ someone   Assuming you ve made the decision to hire someone as a full employee  you ll want to consider having an employee offer letter and an employee handbook  Your employment contract will generally be short and standardized across all employees at your company  Your employee handbook will be somewhat longer  and outline a variety of policies that your company has instituted which you expect employees to be familiar with   Both your employment offer letter and your employee handbook will be written by lawyers  and likely not that customized to the specifics of your company at first  These are risk mitigation devices for the business  the chief purpose is making it clear that every employee has been given adequate notice of a variety of things which  in your jurisdiction  you need to provide explicit notice for  This is highly dependent on your particular jurisdiction  which is one reason you ll always want to talk to a lawyer prior to hiring someone for the first time   Intellectual property assignments  Companies produce  intellectual property   IP  copyrights  patents  and inventions as a matter of course  IP can be as simple as  words on your website  or as complicated as a fully functional software application or business process   It is critically important that technology companies  particularly product companies  own all IP produced for it by employees and contractors  If it does not  an employee or contractor could later claim that you are infringing on their IP by continuing to operate your business  and force you to either shut down  excise their IP  at great cost   or pay them an exorbitant amount of money to go away   This is not a speculative threat for internet companies  IP is likely central to the entire operations of the company  Many internet companies have trajectories where certain events  like receiving investment or closing an acquisition  are gated on intensive due diligence investigations regarding proper IP ownership  The combination of these factors make anyone with unassigned IP in a company into a headache if they re willing to cooperate or a very expensive problem if they re not  Note that  as a company progresses  it will tend to part ways with an employee or partner in less than ideal circumstances at least once  you do not want to have IP issues be a stick available to whack you with should that happen   There is a relatively simple method for insulating your company from IP issues  work with counsel to obtain signed IP assignments from everyone who works for your company  without fail  This includes all founders of the company  all employees  and anyone who works for the company in any capacity  including independent contractors and entities performing work for hire for you  It does not matter if someone is only a customer service contractor or a freelance web designer brought in for a day   It is also easier to ask everyone to sign an IP assignment agreement than to track who should have signed an agreement  particularly as that changes the tech industry is rife with CTOs who were hired as summer interns four years ago and haven t signed a new contract since that day   Your lawyers can draft an IP assignment for you  which you ll either include in your standard employment agreement and contractor MSA or which you ll ask to be signed separately but at the same time  Your agreement will likely default to the company owning everything an employee even thinks of during their term of employment with you  Employees might push back on this and their reasoning may or may not be sound  if necessary  your lawyer can debate it with them  Generally  you should stick with the form you ve been provided except in extreme circumstances   Most law firms which do substantial amounts of business with internet companies will have a template IP assignment ready to go for a nominal fee  They re often fairly long  as this is a very high salience issue for internet companies and these agreements do get tested in a variety of high stress scenarios with huge amounts of money on the line   If your company eventually gets a movie made about it  having an IP assignment ready from day one will prevent one subplot of that movie being having to pay a ridiculous amount of money to someone who never really worked for you   Many internet entrepreneurs are surprised how insistent investors and lawyers are about this topic  For technology companies  IP is the business  Moreover  IP ownership issues are usually much easier to address on the front end  when the IP may not be worth as much  than the back end  where the IP may have proven integral to the company s success   so paying attention on the front end is key to ensuring you re free from issues down the line   Equity for employees  We ll eventually write more about this topic  In the meanwhile  know this above all else  most sophisticated founders avoid giving equity  or rights to acquire equity  like stock options  outright to either founders or employees  Instead  they insist on  vesting   where the right to equity or options is earned over a period of time  The standard in Silicon Valley is  four year vesting with a one year cliff   the individual has no rights to equity or option exercises during the first year  has rights to 25  of the award instantly on the date of their first anniversary  and receives rights to the remainder evenly over the next 36 months   Vesting is critically important  Founding teams break up  Frequently  Employees quit or get fired  Frequently  You may not want a material portion of your company to be owned by someone who worked for you for six weeks  five years ago  It might complicate discussions about receiving investment or selling the business  and it may not align incentives with the sustained effort over time that builds meaningful companies   Payroll  Your company will be required to calculate and withhold an anticipated amount of taxes from any employees of the company   In the United States  employers withhold an anticipated amount of taxes  but employees file a tax return once a year to actually calculate how much is  really  owed they then settle up directly with the government for the difference    Many U S  employers  run payroll  every other week  traditionally on Friday  Some pay twice a month  on the 15th and last day of the month  It is less common to run it monthly  which may or may not be allowed in your jurisdiction   some employers run it weekly  which is more expensive and more work but which results in employees getting paid more often  which they enjoy   At smaller scales  some founders attempt to calculate payroll for the founding team and first few employees by themselves  Virtually all startups with more than a handful of employees will choose to use a payroll service to manage the calculation of payroll  deduction of withholding taxes  submissions of quarterly withholding tax returns  and other assorted operational tasks   Your payroll process does not typically include contractors  who are responsible for their own tax payments  and who are paid periodically after they invoice you  under the terms of your contract  rather than a very predictable schedule like most employees are   Your business will  once a year  issue an  informational return  to every employee or contractor of your business  In the United States  most employees will receive a W 2 and contractors will receive a 1099 MISC  These will generally be filed by your accountant or payroll service on your behalf  When you hire someone  you will ask them to fill out a W 9 form to receive their social security number or other individual identification number  which will be required for running payroll for them  If you hire someone who is not a U S  citizen or permanent resident and who does not actually perform work in the United States  you may not be required to pay employment taxes on them  but you should collect their information on a W 8BEN to document this choice  For specifics  please ask your accountant international taxation is very fact specific and can get tricky  particularly once bilateral tax treaties come into play   Managing risk  Many entrepreneurs think that running a business is likely the riskiest thing they ve ever done  That is probably true  at least from the perspective of financial decisions   Business failure is unfortunate but very survivable  sports and cars both kill a much higher fraction of users    Risk in business is manageable  That is one major reason why firms exist as a concept  they pool a source of risk  the business enterprise  and then separate the economic upside of undertaking the risk  the liabilities associated with the risk  and the actual duties of operating the business   Incorporation is one way that internet businesses use to limit risk  by capping the amount the owners investors are exposed to liability for debts or damages or injuries to others should not  in general  flow from the business to the owners investors  Businesses don t like the prospect of losing all of their assets in the event of e g  a lawsuit  though  so there are other mechanisms as well  We ll talk about some of them   Insurance  Insurance is a way to transfer risk from the insured to the insurance company  The insurance company does this in return for guaranteed payments   premiums   from a large pool of insureds  Assuming the insurance company prices the insurance correctly and or invests the premiums well before paying out  they profit from offering this service while their customers trade the uncertainty of a catastrophic loss for the certainty of a predictable insurance payment   Businesses purchase a number of types of insurance  The overwhelming majority of policies  and share of payments  is for employment related insurance  which is discussed in more detail elsewhere  A much smaller portion is for policies which protect the company   Professional liability errors and omissions insurance  Companies which produce software which interacts with businesses  data  or who produce software which businesses run  or who work on systems owned by clients  have relatively large exposures in the event of their software malfunctioning  A software upgrade which disrupts a mid sized business can cost them tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue  they might decide to sue to collect  A contractor who accidentally drops the production database while doing testing could be held liable for all the costs for replacing it  which could be almost unbounded   These risks are covered by professional liability insurance  sometimes called  Errors and Omissions   E 0  insurance  The mechanics of the policy are simple  pay a small amount of money every year  generally about  1 000 to start  it scales slowly with the number of employees or revenue of the company   If you don t get sued  nothing happens  If you do get sued  you  open a claim   forward the relevant details  to your insurance company  Liability for claims covered by your insurance shifts from you to your insurance company  to the extent described in your policy and subject to limits and deductibles  The insurance company will typically take over responding to the suit  which will frequently result in them offering a settlement  to avoid the expense of trial   Lawsuits are expensive  almost nobody wants to take one through the entire process    Very few software companies actually get sued   Insurance companies report in regulatory filings that the risk for e g  small software development consultancies is less than 1  per year  You can dig this fact out of regulatory filings if you d like to   Most companies which deal primarily with consumers limit their liability with contracts and offering refunds if the software is not to the customers  liking  It is incredibly unlikely that you ll be sued just because someone is merely unhappy with your services   That said  if your software actually materially damages a customer  which is quite plausible for B2B services  a lawsuit is a distinct possibility  This is particular true in the U S   which institutionally deals with many controversies via the legal system where they would be resolved by private negotiation in other countries   This fact sometimes surprises entrepreneurs doing business internationally    Additionally  because sophisticated businesses know that there exists the possibility that having you interface with their systems will expose them to expensive remediation  they will often require  as a term of doing business with you  that you carry an insurance policy   The policy limits for E O policies generally start at  1 million   Lawsuits are generally substantially cheaper than the limits they average about  40 000 in settlements and costs according to regulatory filings of one E O company across all of their insured companies in the tech industry   Buying more is relatively inexpensive   1 million is generally sufficient for companies which are just starting out  You can  and should  renew your policy yearly  renewal time is a great time to think about whether you have adequate coverage for your exposures   Business insurance in the U S  is generally sold by agents of the insurance companies  who are combination sales representatives and professional advisors  Unsurprisingly  since they re paid on commission by the insurance companies  their professional advice is often that you buy more insurance from them  Your lawyer or accountant can often give you a rough idea of what an appropriate level is given the level of exposure of your business   General liability insurance  Virtually every business should carry  general liability  insurance if you have a physical presence in the United States   If you don t  you may elect to skip this if it is not the norm in your country    General liability insurance is sometimes sold bundled with E O insurance   E O insurance insures against the risks posed uniquely by the type of work you do  General liability is more diffuse  it insures against risks posed by the physical existence of your company  For example  if you have an office  it is theoretically possible that someone could slip in or in front of the office  resulting in your company being liable for their  perhaps substantial  medical bills  This is relatively infrequent  but general liability covers enough distinct  relatively infrequent  sources of stress to be worth the peace of mind it brings to many entrepreneurs   In addition to accidents at your physical location  general liability might protect you from employee malfeasance  having property stolen from your business  loss in the event of a fire  or similar  The exact insured risks will be listed in your policy  read it very carefully  You ll typically only file a general liability claim when something extremely expensive has happened  you do not want to be told  We don t cover that very expensive thing which happened  didn t you read subsection D on page 22  It clearly says that    Contrary to occasional grousing  insurance companies are generally not crooks  They re extensively regulated in the United States  It is just  by the nature of the business  very detail oriented  much more similar to programming than to creative writing   You ll purchase your general liability insurance through an insurance agent  likely the same one who sells you your E O line  The policy might be combined with your E O policy or sold separately  Expect to pay only a few hundred dollars a year for this   Risk reducers for underwriting  As part of getting an insurance policy written  you will be asked questions by the insurer s  underwriting  department  which needs to decide whether your business has a level of risk which can be profitably insured given the premiums the insurance company wants to charge you  It s to your advantage to know how to answer questions from an underwriter in a professional and honest manner such that they approve your application   Helpfully  knowing the sorts of things insurance companies look for is very useful  because they re literally in the business of figuring out what choices end badly  You can alter some operations of your business to have more positive answers to their questions  both increasing your likelihood of getting covered at lower premiums and also removing sources of risk from your business   Here are some questions you might be asked   Do you use written contracts for selling services  The right answer is  unsurprisingly   Yes   Some underwriters will drill into specifics of the contracts  such as   Do the contracts have wording limiting the scope of your guarantee or warranty with regards to work   Do the contracts have heightened terms for the standard of care you re required to bring  or are you given more discretion   Do the contracts have mid project checkpoints such as milestones with required sign off from the customer  a defined payment schedule  etc   Do the contracts limit damages that you could be assessed   Does the contract envision a formal change order process where both parties have to agree in writing to changes in scope   All of these allow underwriters to see that your contract has been drafted in the anticipation of it potentially being tested by a contentious project with a client   Do you have substantial experience in the industry  More experience is better than less experience  naturally  It is generally to your benefit to write your description of your experience in a way which is absolutely truthful and easily comprehensible by someone who is not an expert in your field   Click through agreements and public policies  Certain sorts of standard contracts are relatively non negotiable  You ve almost certainly agreed to one for example  if you ve ever  accepted Terms of Use  or signed a contract with a cell phone company   These contracts are used when a  negotiating individualized contract terms with every customer would be counterproductive and b  when the contracts can nonetheless meaningfully limit exposure of the company to risk   You are highly likely to have some contracts which apply generally to folks doing business with you  You will additionally have some public written policies which aren t contracts themselves  but rather are designed to clarify certain important details about doing business with you   Orrick  the global tech law firm  is the legal partner for Stripe Atlas  Experts at Orrick contributed their expertise to this section  see disclaimer   and Atlas users can access a more detailed Atlas Legal Guide written by Orrick   Depending on what your company does  you may want to have   Privacy policy  Refund  warranty  and return policy  Terms of service terms of use  Privacy policy  Every internet company collects data  Big  heaping mountains of data   Consumers want to know that you re not going to abuse personal information you collect  More importantly  government regulators want companies to tell consumers about the company s data practices  There are overlapping and at times conflicting laws  regulations  and guidance about privacy disclosures  some of which vary by industry or by state  not to mention all of the foreign laws   but in general  you will need to have a written Privacy Policy available on your website or mobile app anywhere you do business   Companies that collect personal data or handle user data online generally have a privacy policy  You may be legally required to post a Privacy Policy under certain state laws and or laws which apply to specific industries  or if you engage in certain activities  like online advertising  There are a variety of counterparties  such as financial institutions and hosting providers  which would hold the non existence of a privacy policy against you  even if you internally had the understanding  Well  we re just doing the usual no spam  Google Analytics  standard Nginx logs   Also  if you sell to other businesses  your business customers will likely require you to post a Privacy Policy as a condition of doing business with you   Privacy Policies are less a legal contract and more a semi standardized way for you to communicate your plans about data with your customers  Having an inaccurate privacy policy may be worse in some respects than not having any at all   Orrick  for example  has written in detail about seemingly harmless terms that were given strict scrutiny by regulators    The Privacy Policy is customarily written in non technical plain language and is relatively short  Important points to cover in a United States privacy policy include   What information do you collect  Who has access to it  Under what circumstances will you release it to 3rd parties  How you use data for advertising  including online tracking  How long do you store it for  Additional information may be required if you re doing business wholly or partly outside of the United States  where more stringent data privacy laws may apply  e g   the European Union    Most internet companies do not list every single bit of information they collect  but rather use representative examples  largely because customers aren t competent to evaluate the specifics   If you are in a very privacy conscious domain such as healthcare or if you collect children s personal information  where there exist specific regulations  the specifics matter quite a bit and are outside the scope of this guide    If you don t have a Privacy Policy ready  think about what information you collect  organize your thoughts internally  then adopt a pre written privacy policy and customize it to make sure that it is accurate to the operations of your business  working with your lawyer where necessary  Automattic  the makers of WordPress  have generously released their privacy policy under a permissive license  so that you can make light edits to it and have a reasonably sane policy ready almost immediately   As always for contract like documents  if you have any questions  ask a lawyer   Refund policy returns policy  When e commerce first started  people were terrified about sending money over the internet  What if the goods weren t exactly to their liking  What if the 20kb gif didn t show the color of the dress accurately  What if  What if  What if   Refund policies are a great way to pre emptively answer  What If   in a way which increases your conversion rates  minimizes unhappy customers  and streamlines your operations  If you take payments online  your payments processor will require that you have a refund policy posted prominently  it is generally to your advantage to have it visible near the point of checkout because some customers will look   In general  most internet businesses choose to be extraordinarily generous with refunds  This is particularly true of IP based businesses which have relatively little hard costs for providing their goods services  such as software or SaaS companies   Many software companies would have the following as their full refund policy   Feel free to use or adapt it  if you want    Refund Policy We want you to be thrilled with your purchase  If it isn t satisfactory for any reason  we will happily refund the entire purchase price for up to 30 days after your purchase   Policies for e commerce companies are generally a little more complicated  particularly around returns of tangible goods  like clothing or other consumer products   You should should mention what the process is for requesting a return  where the returned item should be mailed to  whether the item can be returned if used  what the timelines are  who absorbs costs for shipping  and return shipping   etc   One might wonder  Why are even the most generous refund policies often time limited   This is something your accountant will probably demand from you  an unlimited refund policy greatly complicates when you re allowed to recognize revenue  Many companies will officially say that they only process refunds within the first 30 or 60 days while they  unofficially or semi officially  actually will refund any purchase ever made  even years after the fact   In some countries it is a legal requirement that the refund period extend from receipt of a product or performance of a service  not from the transaction date  in the case where the transaction is before  There may also be requirements that the refund period be at least a certain period of time  e g   90 days   In general  one can simply adopt the most generous term  tightening your refund language is very rarely the point of most leverage in your business   Terms of Service Terms of Use  Most web sites operated commercially  and substantially all web applications  will have a Terms of Use   These are sometimes called  Terms of Service   and abbreviated TOU or TOS    They range from informal descriptions of what constitutes acceptable use of the site  often including terms like  no spamming    no uploading viruses   and  no threats of violence   to  for applications  full contracts specifying payment terms  limitation of liability  etc   Many companies who do not directly charge for their website choose to publish a more informal terms of use  If you take signups to your site  you can require that customers accept the terms of use via checking a box during signup  Record the date time of the acceptance  in case you are asked about it later   If you are selling software or software as a service  your terms of use is probably a full fledged contract  though a short one  A lawyer can draft one for you  but this is probably unnecessary unless your software operates in a market which is likely to require a high degree of attention to compliance or liability concerns   Healthcare  financial services  and the like come to mind ask your lawyer if you re curious    If you re producing software for consumers or smaller businesses  you can probably adapt Automattic s permissively licensed Terms of Service from their WordPress product  This will take you only a few minutes  Force customers to agree to it via a checkbox when signing up for your service  record the time when the consent was given   Will I actually ever need these things    You may never find your policies tested in a court of law   Having the policies is widely used as a check by businesses and regulators for whether you re operating your business in a professional fashion   You will likely not be approved by a financial institution to accept payments unless you have a ToS  refund policy  and returns policy  if you ship tangible goods    For example  in the event of a chargeback filed against a purchase for your software  you can expect to lose almost automatically if the issuing bank says  The customer says they didn t agree to pay  Do you have a contract   and your only answer is  Well they signed up for an account   The right answer is  Bob Smith signed up for an account on March 23rd  He affirmatively accepted our Terms of Service  a copy of which I ve attached  The Terms of Service explicitly says that customers are obligated to pay for the service    You ll still lose some chargebacks  even when you ve documented everything correctly  but doing everything correctly gives you a chance   Companies can benefit from the practice of drafting a Privacy Policy as it forces you to think critically about your data practices  understand the regulatory landscape  which can involve some weird   and costly   rules and regulations   and establish policies and procedures that will benefit your company in the long term  Establishing good privacy practices from the get go helps to ensure you maximize the value of your data assets  avoid regulatory pitfalls  and mitigate the risks  and consequences  of a data breach   Getting minimally compliant with these policies can usually be done quickly and efficiently  particularly in light of the benefits  You will need to review and update these policies  particularly your Privacy Policy  as your business changes and grows  and can expect to do a deeper dive in the future when you have more resources  With that said  depending on where you re doing business and what your business is  these documents may need to be changed more often  For example  if your business involves handling data provided by kids  then there s a patchwork of different state laws that currently apply and the regulatory landscape is constantly changing  if your business is a subscription service  various states have  and others may adopt  laws that require you to put certain additional disclaimers in your terms of use regarding automatic renewals   Transactions and agreements  Most entrepreneurs have signed a contract at some point in their lives prior to starting a company  but the types of contracts  and related agreements and documentation  used by companies for day to day  transactional  commerce are new to most entrepreneurs   We ll walk you through what you re likely to run into in the first year of running an online company  We re not lawyers  so rely on your lawyers for legal

entrepreneur may want to sell a part of their business to another company  This sale will quite possibly require  due diligence  an in depth inspection of the books  records  and processes of the asset being conducted by the buyer  Due diligence can be extraordinarily disruptive to day to day operations of the business  and is something which businesses do not want to offer to mere tire kickers  Additionally  due diligence will expose the potential buyer to sensitive information from the selling business   Accordingly  sellers will try to sign LOIs with prospective buyers  which soft commit the buyer to purchase  contingent on the successful completion of due diligence   These will often include  or be paired with  a non disclosure agreement  which will prohibit the buy,"[68 848

meander and spend  3 hours on this topic this week   Save some of these links and read them throughout the week  Immerse yourself in this topic and leave the week smarter than you started it   Join here to receive the next Edition of Evergreen Business Weekly   Evergreen is a Bi weekly collection of links to the best learning resources in business  collected by a group of managers  founders  and investors  We contribute resources about one topic  which are synthesized and shared in this Bi weekly Edition  The aim is to learn more efficiently through increased context and focus   A good business  and a good life  is made of good decisions  Where to invest  what to prioritize  and which ideas to work on  Opportunity cost is everywhere  and we only have a few years to leave our mark   So the most fundamental question is how do we decide which businesses to work on  which products to launch  and what companies to build   That is the goal of validation   to put some rigorous thought around where to spend your time and effort to achieve the greatest results   Where Validation Fits In  Validation of a business idea can be a fuzzy concept  It lives somewhere between  I have an idea  and  I m going to invest in testing this idea    Ideation   Validation   Customer Development   Product Market Fit  To me  it is the step that answers an important set of questions  Does this idea suck  Will this Business succeed  Should it  Where does this lead   Too often  businesses are begun without enough consideration  Validation is meant to create pause for thought and reflection  to examine the opportunity before you and think hard about investing years of your life into solving a specific problem   This isn t always about whether or not the business will be successful  but whether or not YOU are the person to build it  and what it will mean for your life  your family  and your future   Pitfalls of Business Ideas  The most helpful kind of tool for this type of thinking is Inversion   making a good decision by NOT making a bad decision  It is often easier to avoid stupidity than achieve brilliance   This section is dedicated to dynamics that can kill your business in its crib   Path Dependence  Infrastructure  and Entrepreneurship  This post does a great job of explaining why some industries and products are so resistant to change  If you ve ever wondered why some technologies get disrupted  and some seem to never change   Path Dependence and Infrastructure   Not that anything is impossible  but operating in each area requires a different strategy   You find markets where disruption will tend to run rampant where infrastructure costs are high and interdependence is low  i e   Hard drives   You find markets that require full stack innovators to attack an entire ecosystem  where interdependence is high but infrastructure costs are relatively low  i e   automobiles   You find markets where both infrastructure and interdependence is high  often resulting in collective inaction  i e   Utilities   And finally  you find very adaptable markets where there s low infrastructure and interdependence  i e   professional services    Knowing where you sit tells you whether you need to integrate up and down the stack  delivering everything from product to post sale services  It tells you whether you can expect collusion from incumbents  And it tells you whether venture financing or public investment provide more realistic paths towards rollout  It s not as simple as just having a superior technology  If you re in a market where you re fighting the entrenched interests of the entire ecosystem  having a 10x cost advantage relative to your direct competitors might not even be enough   Starting a business in certain industries is a death wish  because of hidden  seemingly illogical anchors that are only obvious to those with a familiarity with the industry  By studying and understanding these concepts and the space you would operate in  you can avoid this trap   Thanks to the man myth legend Nick Seguin for suggesting this post   Low Situational Awareness  This is a very benign sounding term  but in this post from Simon Wardley  the danger of Low Situational Awareness is put very sharply   Especially if you love chess metaphors    His point is that much of business is conducted through reasoning by analogy  or testing of hypotheses   X worked for Y  so we ll try X    Most businesses exist in low level situational awareness      They have no context  they are rife with meme copying  magic sequences and are dominated by action  We already know that this has an impact not only from individual examples but by examination of a range of companies  It turns out that high levels of situational awareness appears to be correlated with positive market cap changes over a seven year period   From my read of this post   context  is a deep understanding of the industry you re in  and the mental fortitude to reason  and build  from first principles  The power of High Situational Awareness comes from thorough research and understanding  experience working in the space  and the mindset to avoid lazy  analogous thinking   This is a great post to scare you into pursuing businesses where you have High Situational Awareness  because of the absolute futility of operating against someone who sees the game in dimensions you cannot   Thanks to veteran Evergreen contributor Itamar Goldminz for the addition   The  Do You Solve a Real Problem  Test  Value Creation   For a business to be successful  it must do two things  Create Value  and Capture Value  Value Creation is the most basic fundamental of business   what work a business does to create a product that has utility for people   Here is a whole Edition of Evergreen about Value Creation  with great resources to go deep on the concept   Understanding how businesses create value is a good model to apply to your business idea   in the simplest terms   How will you create unique value for customers    The  Can You Actually Make Money  Test  Value Capture   The sister concept to Value Creation is more subtle  and often overlooked  Which is probably a huge reason that the failure rate of new businesses is so high   people think about whether they can create and sell a product  not about whether they can make a profit creating and selling the product   We also have a whole Edition of Evergreen dedicated to thinking about Value Capture in different ways  which would be a valuable set of tests for evaluating a new business idea  It will help you avoid traps like commoditized industries  businesses that require reinvestment  and market price setting sectors   Here is some of what is covered in the Value Capture Edition   The Relationship Between Value Creation   Value Capture  How Required Reinvestment Destroys Value Capture  Why Not All Revenue is Created Equal  How Pricing is the True Test of Value Capture  The Value Capture test is what can save you from starting a commoditized  easily duplicated business that will yield a low margin  and have you working harder and harder just to stay in business with an ever decreasing profit staying in your pocket   Are You The Right Person For This Business   This is the question that brings you into consideration  Many business ideas can be good for certain people  yet terrible for others to pursue   There are two concepts that come together here   Knowing yourself well enough to know your strengths  weaknesses  interests  and triggers for impatience  Knowing your potential market well enough to understand all of what building a business in this space will entail   This is a concept called Founder Market Fit in the Startup world  Chris Dixon has a short post that explores what it means and shows the impact that has on a startups success   In my opinion  the best predictor of whether a startup will achieve product market fit is whether there is what David Lee calls  founder market fit   Founder market fit means the founders have a deep understanding of the market they are entering  and are people who  personify their product  business and ultimately their company   This is not only about the success of the company  but your happiness is at stake as well  If you have no patience for kids  maybe your idea to revolutionize daycare would make you miserable  and inevitably lead to failure   An important piece of Dixon s post is that this is NOT a static relationship  Markets change and people can learn   no one is born with Founder Market Fit  You can earn your way there by working in market and learning about it  but expect to invest heavily until you have some obvious expertise   What Good Ideas Look Like  So what does an actual good idea look and feel like  How do I know if I have one  When should I feel confident about starting a business based off of my idea   Bad news for you  you won t know until you ve already won   Why   Good Ideas Look Like Bad Ideas  The tough thing about finding a good business idea is that there is a tough paradox where often the best ideas look like bad ideas  If 100 100 people think your idea is good  it is probably actually bad   This 20 minute talk by Chris Dixon at YCombinator s Startup School covers this well  and explains the nuance of a good idea through some interesting Silicon Valley history   If you d like a short  text version  there are some condensed notes here   As a part of this exploration of your business idea  keep in mind that there is a near 100  chance that someone has tried something similar before  This is a tremendous opportunity to learn more about the space  the challenges  and the  maze  you re about to enter  more on that in a second    Thanks to Edson Rigonatti for contributing this video and notes   Go Talk To Some Veterans  To anonymously quote a VC who gave this great advice to a friend of mine   Most people don t go searching for who s tried your idea in the past  You re more interested in finding who failed than who succeeded because there are a lot more of them  but their stories aren t told   Unless you do the effort to talk to those who ve tried to go down the road you re about to take  you haven t done your homework  And if you can t do this exercise  you probably don t care enough about solving the problem to see this through to the end   I believe in both of those statements   there are people out there who know more about the maze you are evaluating than you do  and if you don t take the time to learn from them  you are choosing a particularly dangerous kind of ignorance   Huge caveat here   just because they failed doesn t mean you will  They ll have scars and biases from their attempts  and will unconsciously try to scare you off from the space  Just remember in those conversations to adjust for their  probably very strong  personal beliefs   Thanks to Jon Stenstrom for sharing this advice with me   The Idea Maze  So what is up with the Maze metaphor   Chris Dixon  yes  again  has another great short post about  The Idea Maze   This is a great way to visualize the challenge of coming up with a business idea  because a good business idea is not ONE idea   Good startup ideas are well developed  multi year plans that contemplate many possible paths according to how the world changes   Good business ideas are actually many ideas  with many different contingencies and alternate routes planned if  Plan A  does not work out as intended  because it won t    The Maze reminds you that good business ideas unfold over years  and it is impossible to plan it all out perfectly from the start  It shows you that you have to get the best map and guides you can find  but that you will still have to make hard decisions with little information  hit dead ends  retrace steps  and bump into some walls on your way through   Oh  and don t run out of money while you re inside the maze   Thanks to Andrew Brown of Oyster   Google for suggesting this post   The Book To Read  Last and possibly most important   The Innovator s Dilemma  by Harvard Business School Professor Clayton Christensen   This book is the classic read in crafting and evaluating industries  and how to go about entering and disrupting them  starting successful businesses with potential to grow   Importantly  it also tells you when to ignore all of the advice previously covered in this Edition   Much of what the best executives in successful companies have learned about managing innovation is not relevant to disruptive technologies  Most marketers  for example  have been schooled extensively  at universities and on the job  in the important art of listening to their customers  but few have any theoretical or practical training in how to discover markets that do not yet exist   This book was a known favorite of Steve Jobs  and it is clear reading it what the power of these ideas were for him  and we can historically see them applied within Apple   Thanks to Jason Evanish of Lighthouse for suggesting this piece of canon   To Sum Up  To boil it down to one sentence   Don t underthink your business idea    First  try not to pick a shitty idea that will lead your business into an early grave   Second  try to pick an idea that is uniquely well suited to you  and likely to make you a happy person even if it doesn t succeed massively   Third  you will never 100  know that you have a great idea  It will always involve some uncertainty   Fourth  even great ideas require continuous refinement and reinvention  Be ready to keep working on it for years to come,"[82 1221 432 752 1136 856 545 745 68 1044 1317]"
96,training-dataset/business/1172.txt,business,The Post YC SlumpAt the end of a YC batch  the general consensus among the partners is that about 25  of the companies are on a trajectory that could lead to a multi billion dollar company  Of course  only a handful of them do  Most go on to be decent or bad   These companies have a beautifully exponential growth curve during YC  and then a few months after YC is over  it essentially flatlines  Because it would be so much better for us if this did not happen  we wonder a lot about why   The main problem is that companies stop doing what they were doing during YC instead of relentlessly focusing on building a great product and growing  they focus on everything else  They also work less hard and less effectively the peer pressure during YC is a powerful force   The startups justify this to themselves in all sorts of ways  We re doing some longer term strategic work  You wouldn t understand    We re cleaning up our technical debt    We re building out the organization    We re focusing on PR for this month  I m going to speak at 6 conferences and writing two thought leadership pieces    We are different  growth isn t our most important thing   We ve heard all of these from startups that have gone on to disappoint   In general  startups get distracted by fake work  Fake work is both easier and more fun than real work for many founders  Two particularly bad cases are raising money and getting personal press  we ve seen many promising founders fall in love with one or  usually  both of these  which nearly always ends badly  But the list of fake work is long   I tell founders to consider how directly a task relates to growing  Obviously  building and selling are the best  Things like hiring are also very high on the list you will need to hire to sustain your growth rate at some point  Interviewing lots of lawyers has got to be near the bottom   During YC  we are ruthless about reminding startups that fake work does not count and will still get you a failed startup no matter how intensely you do it  We are also ruthless about asking for your progress  and being honest with you if things aren t working  After YC  we have less contact with startups you can go dark on us if you want  This  by itself  is almost always a sign that a startup is doing badly   Momentum is everything in a startup  If you have momentum  you can survive most other problems  If you do not have momentum  nothing except getting momentum will solve your problems  Founders internalize this during YC  many seem to forget in the few years after YC  Burnout seems to almost always affect founders whose startups are not doing well  and then becomes a downward spiral  In fact  one of my top few startup commandments is  never let the company lose momentum    There are a few other common problems  One is a feeling of  we made it  that comes after a big financing round and a reduction in intensity  A related problem is that after you ve raised a lot of money or become somewhat well known  it s harder to admit that things aren t working and you need to change direction  Also  very small startups can grow by sheer force of will  even with a bad product  This stops working after a few months as the numbers get larger  and if you haven t built something people love  you will not be able to continue growing   So how can startups avoid this slump  Work on real work  Stay focused on building a product your users love and hitting your growth targets  Try to have a board and peers who will make you hold yourself accountable don t lose the urgency that you developed during YC  Keep sending updates on your traction to your investors and anyone else who will read them  in fact  we re building some new software at YC to automate this for our startups in the hope that it prevent some of them from going off the rails   Make the mistake of focusing too much on what matters most  not too little  and relentlessly protect your time from everything else  Don t ever let yourself feel like you ve won before you have  I still don t think the Airbnb founders feel like they ve won  You have to keep up a high level of intensity for many  many years   Many YC startups learns these lessons after a year or two in the wilderness  but for some it s too late and for all it s a waste of time     The best startups we fund keep on doing exactly what they did during YC  This sounds so simple and so obvious  but in practice so few founders do it     The good news is it s doable with deliberate effort  If every founder  YC and otherwise  did it  the number of successful startups would probably double,"[96 286 622 211 545 711 856 1317 1044 161 1034]"

111,training-dataset/business/813.txt,business,Growth and Traction for FundraisingSeedcamp Partner  Carlos Espinal  has written this piece focusing on how to show growth and traction for early stage startups looking for investment  with key contributions from our Experts in Residence Scott Sage and Keith Wallington  and Jeff Lynn  CEO of Seedrs   As an early stage startup trying to fundraise  you ll likely have to tell a version of your company s story that demonstrates high likelihood of growth to attract an investor  Which are the stories that are most commonly used during the early stages of a business  and which ones later on   In this post  we ll cover the various forms of  validation   traction  that you can potentially leverage in conversations with potential future investors as well as to create internal benchmarks for you and your team   If we look back at this topic as a form of storytelling  below are the  stories  I hear the most  alone or multiple at once    Look at my amazing team   effectively  whilst we haven t yet produced anything  we have gathered experts that will likely generate something great   Look at my amazing product in an amazing market   the traditional point of fundraising  where you ve identified a meaningful enough market and have embarked on creating a product and are fundraising to hit product market fit   Look at my amazing investors  past  or about to invest  and are committed in the round    Look at my amazing growth  non monetized    typical of social networks   Look at my amazing growth  monetized    pretty much every other type of business that isn t included in  4 above   In previous blog posts  I ve covered what makes an amazing team and how investors evaluate a team  what Tier an investor is in and how other investors might judge who is in your round  In this one  I want to focus on 4 and 5 of the list above  Basically  understanding when you have any kind of traction and what constitutes  impressive  for the average investor   One way of trying to benchmark what is  impressive  is by looking at some companies that are generally considered to have done extremely well  In this Quora post  we can see a few of the companies often referred to as  impressive    Weekly Revenue Growth  AirBnB  17 25   Facebook  21 5   for more detail check out this post   Groupon  25 1   However  as impressive as they are  these numbers don t show the entire story  They hide various operational and industry dynamics that are only possible in the sectors in which those companies operate  For example  the cost of acquisition and the sales cycle for each of these businesses might be drastically different than yours  Looking at these figures as a 1 1 to what you have to achieve might create an insecurity complex and frustrating unit economics  Effectively  you can t compare oranges with apples  They re impressive for sure  but are they applicable to your company and is it realistic for you to sustain those kinds of numbers in the long term   Whilst the above point might seem self evident for extreme cases  I m always surprised by what I hear some founders receive as feedback from investors when being compared to idealized growth cases   Let s kick things off with the easiest form of growth to talk about  user growth in any kind of network effect business where monetization is not the immediate short term goal  The most typical example will be social networks   These kinds of companies are the ones that are the most referenced to when looking for ridiculous growth rates  Facebook and Twitter in their early days are good examples  However  before we get into what kind of week on week growth is impressive  let s tackle one very big point that makes any growth meaningful   If the business s successful growth allows it to have lock in effect  then a non monetized growth strategy early on makes sense as a way to monopolize the customer base and once locked in  monetization strategies can be considered without fearing user growth rate loss and churn to competitors and or substitutes   Not all businesses that embark on a non monetized high user growth rate strategy truly have lock in capabilities so it is not unusual to have these be the ones most investors are less interested in  If there is any risk that you might fall into this category  start thinking about what could make your user growth rate create a lock in that no competitor could make you lose   For these kinds of businesses where user growth rates are what is being used as a proxy for future revenue  a 6 10  week on week growth rate will be considered as impressive  Above 10  week on week would be considered as boss level growth  as can be seen from Facebook or other companies mentioned in the Quora post above  Only a few companies frequently achieve these levels  Other impressive growth rates from companies falling into this category can be seen here   Once a company decides it needs to be charging early on because its product doesn t have a network effect built in  or where there are plenty of substitutes in their market   one can expect the company to be measured by a different set of growth rate standards  Although there are always exceptions  once money is involved  things get more complicated   There are several factors that can generate a different set of growth rates  with the main ones being   Sales cycles  Marketplace balancing  Operational capacity building  Sales cycles can vary greatly from business to business and can serve as a proxy for sales growth until you actually materialize sales  If you want a quick brief on sales cycles  this link will walk you through the basics   Comparing growth rates of monetized companies becomes complicated because not all of them have the same sales cycles  We re back to our orange to apple comparison dilemma  Some might have a heftier cost of customer acquisition but can sell immediately  such as software download   while others might require a subscription once someone deems the relationship with the service worthwhile  such as dating sites  but might be able to leverage virality effects intrinsic to their sector or customers  needs desires to lower their cost of acquisition  Life isn t fair  but let s try and see how we can compare businesses in these categories   Let s first start by looking at companies that have a long sales cycle  These companies might have interactions with their customers via newsletters  social media  click throughs etc  but can have frustratingly low month on month growth rates on conversion  For those  a good starting point as a proxy for growth is to have engaging discussions really early on about the value you bring to your customers so you can use it as a proxy to the actual  and hopefully  eventual  conversion point  Try and find correlations between behavior and interactions with your product as a precursor to conversion between marketing initiatives  content marketing reads  etc    This isn t easy or pretty  but having nothing to speak about on why your early customer might care is likely unacceptable  This also helps to think about what kind of  features  you can build into your product that can signal the intent of conversion in the future  For example  does adding things into a wish list you ve created for customers increase conversion once key dates in the year come around  holidays or birthday    As a software company  you should not get caught in the sales funnel trap  Too many startups equate growth to how many deal leads are being added to the sales funnel every week  Adding X  new business to your pipeline every week is great  but if the output   closed deals   is close to nil and not growing  you have a serious problem  If you and your team are able to convert your top of the funnel demand into an efficient sales process and close deals  well done  But if you re like most startups  you will have inexperienced people adding every possible deal lead in the world into the sales pipeline without knowing 1  how to qualify those deals or 2  whether they even fit what a typical buyer looks like   So  how should we think about traction from the standpoint of a software startup and their sales cycle  One important note to make is that the range of pricing varies greatly  A startup selling  100k enterprise deals will have a longer and more complicated sales cycle than a startup selling a  5k deal that may not require the board s or your CFO s sign off  Investors want to see consistency in your sales execution  If you were able to close nine deals in the first quarter of focusing on sales  then they will want to see at least nine deals in the next quarter  The more deals your team closes  the better they get at qualifying opportunities  pushing the sale through  and understanding where various customers receive the most value from your product  Once you have a good idea of what your sales cycle looks like  then you should be able to shorten the cycle and in theory  close more deals faster with the same team   At a high level for SaaS businesses  investors want to see an absolute minimum of 100  growth year over year  Assuming your sales and marketing team and costs stay the same from one year to the next  investors will expect you to retain a very high proportion of customers from the first year  let s assume for simplicity you re able to keep 100  of the revenue from year one s customers by retaining 90  and up sell another 10    Then with the same team  you should be able to acquire the same number of customers with roughly the same size of contracts  So Y1 s recurring bookings   Y2 s new bookings   2x Y1 s first year s bookings   Aside from Sales Cycles  there are other limitations that can create an artificial restriction on growth rates in early stage companies  which make it unfair to compare companies like for like  Two examples include marketplace supply and demand balance  and operational limitations  which when optimized  lead to increased demand   Various successful marketplaces have used a number of strategies to capture a market and grow  but all share a common pattern  which was to start from the supply   Shutterstock  Founded 2003  Started from the supply side by uploading 100 000 pictures on

Demand  Only when supply has been sufficiently grown  Only switch to on demand when it becomes purely organic  supply has reached critical level   Focus on early adopters to kick start the demand as these are the people who will see the value  after this it s a matter of how you ll get the early majority on board and how you create the brand  Summary Table for how to think of where your company s economic opportunities are  So  we ve covered quite a bit of ground on user growth rates  sales cycles  marketplaces and the like  but how about for businesses where there might need to be some stockpiling of inventory first before going out to the market  or perhaps R D and progress therein  before being able to announce launch a product  or how about ones that are just getting better and better in their internal processes and waiting for the next inflection point in demand to really scale up after a fund raise   For now  let s focus on the optimization of production costs that are already existing in order to better demonstrate your company s growth in preparation for a fundraising   Optimizing production costs leads to unlocking the ability to service more customers and  therefore  to grow faster  Until fully optimized  you will be limited not by user interest  but rather by operational limitations  Week on week or month on month growth could  therefore  be pegged to operational improvements   A number of operational blockades will need to be overcome throughout the customer journey   Demand Generation  Can start manually going through a human collection of leads such as contact details etc  and is appropriate for early stage customer validation  The process must be automated or other lead sources secured to ensure marketing can deliver a growing volume of appropriate leads into the customer acquisition funnel   Physical Sales  Might be limited by the number of meetings each sales person can schedule and attend in a week month  solution  study the sales funnel and automate where you can  improve use of CRM  evolve marketing lead qualifications and nurturing processes to deliver better qualified leads to sales such that the customer is more progressed towards a purchase by the time they are handed to sales  Adding more sales people without optimizing these other pieces will likely see CAC not improving as the business grows  Onboarding and Support  Manually onboarding and supporting customers is ok in early customer validation phase but must be automated to the maximum appropriate degree without destroying customer experience to avoid a bottleneck  Often an automated onboarding and support experience  with good monitoring  alerting and access to help  can improve customer experience as they can work at their own pace and not need to fit into a schedule  Impact on Customer  Process innovation by reducing issues internally and unlocking a new rate of growth  Marketplace growth requires balanced growth and should result in week on week growth   In conclusion  there are many variables that can be used to determine a company s growth and traction  by proxy   In a recent chat with Jeff Lynn  founder of Seedrs  he said  the appropriate unit of time to measure a business s growth varies from company to company  One of the things we ve found with Seedrs is that month on month growth rates aren t particularly helpful because we re too spiky in terms of monthly transaction levels  When we look at month on month  one month we re over the moon because we ve grown 200  over the previous month  and then the next month we re in despair because we ve shrunk by 50   We ve now moved to measuring everything on a quarter by quarter basis   even that isn t perfect  and our real cadence is more like six months  but we ve had to balance that against the need to iterate and adapt quickly enough  although in our Series A fundraising materials  we should everything on a six monthly basis  and it worked just fine

go and visit  500 Startups   they would be surprised by how different it is  The kinds of companies we re taking are different  A lot of the companies we funded back in 2011  including both my company  LaunchBit  and Intercom  were very early  Nowadays  to get into the program in a category like SaaS  you have to have some level of traction   John  Thinking back to your batch in 2011  how do you think things like funding environment  competitive environment and expectations of startups are different for the 2016 batch of companies   Elizabeth  To be honest I never expected to enter VC  That was not a dream of mine at all  but 500 Startups  they were an investor in  my startup  LaunchBit    and also an investor in Intercom   so I knew the folks there really well  They re a fun group  and I started mentoring some companies  One thing led to the next  and I got sucked in   John  Elizabeth  welcome to the show  You have an interesting story in that  back in 2011  you were a founder in 500 Startups  second batch of investments  and now you re running the Mountain View accelerator  What drew you away from that product building world to the world of venture capital   If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed    While in Dublin to speak at the inaugural SaaStock Conference   Elizabeth stopped by our office for a quick podcast chat  We covered the difficulties of running your startup while pitching investors  the need for founders to get a handle on taking rejection  why non technical founders still need domain experience  and much more   Elizabeth became a Partner at 500 Startups in the spring of 2015  but her connection to the early stage venture fund dates back much further  LaunchBit  Elizabeth s AdTech startup  acquired in September 2014   was actually part of 500 Startups second batch of investments   Inside the 500 Startups Silicon Valley Accelerator in Mountain View  California  There are companies coming in  actually  a handful in every batch  that are doing more than  1 million in revenue run rate  It s actually a later stage program now  and to that end  we actually offer customer acquisition help  We ve hired a whole team of coaches  That s the biggest difference  And there s carpet now  Back then  there wasn t   John  You know you ve hit the big time when you ve got carpet  Thinking more along the macro environment  rather than 500 Startups itself  what hasn t changed in those five years   Elizabeth  Back in 2011 the funding environment was actually very good  I don t think people appreciated it then  because fundraising is always hard  Even though there s a lot of chatter on the Internet about how investors are tightening their belts  and they re not investing as much  the reality is fundraising has always been hard  It continues to be hard  but there is still a lot of money out there   Pitching your story  John  Many of our listeners are at early stage startups  so if they re not fundraising now  they re probably going to be fundraising soon  As someone who s been on both sides of the VC coin  what s the most important piece of advice you d give them   Elizabeth  There are a lot of components to fundraising  but at the end of the day  the thing to keep in mind about the investor mindset is they are looking to fund growth  So ultimately  you want to tie whatever story you ve got to growth  Maybe that s having an understanding of how much it costs to get a customer  and how much those customers are paying  Tie it to that  I can use your money  say  100 000  to buy X number of customers  and the payback will be Y  That s a super strong story  People don t want to hear about   I m going to hire ten people   So what  Tie it to growth    protip  founders who think they need to  raise  1M to ramp up sales  have their head up their ass   it works the other way around    Dave McClure   davemcclure  September 5  2016  John  Dave McClure tweeted recently that if you re saying you want  1 million to build a sales team  you ve got it backwards  You should be building a sales team so you can get  1 million in investment  or  1 million in revenue   Elizabeth  Exactly  and I think his point was a little bit misconstrued by some people  The point is exactly this  investors want to understand what the growth story is here   John  How hard is it to balance fundraising and all the competing things you have to do as a co founder  You can t really do fundraising as a part time thing  right   You want to tie whatever story you ve got to growth   Elizabeth  Oh  no  It s actually super hard  It s hard at every stage for various reasons  but in the beginning   let s say your first or second seed round   typically the person who s doing the customer acquisition  whether it s the CEO or whatnot  is also the person who s doing the fundraising  It s a very similar skill set  and you have to make a decision  are you going to focus on customer acquisition for your business  or are you going to focus on fundraising   If you go out and fundraise  it has to be a full time job  That means you need to have whatever team you ve got  and that may be just one co founder  help you fill in while you re out  and that s tough   John  What did you enjoy most as a co founder that maybe you miss in the investment world   Elizabeth  In the investment world  even though we do coaching in the seed program  it really isn t the same as building a company  You miss out on the actual building of product and building of teams  and at the end of the day  you also miss out on all the highs  Certainly  startups are mostly lows  but you miss out on all the highs  They re not the same when you watch your portfolio company go through an awesome moment   Learning to take rejection  John  You created a boot camp of sorts  Rejectionathon  which is about his putting yourself in casual situations where you make yourself uneasy  Things like going to a Burger King and trying to order a cheeseburger without meat  The idea here being that you must learn to deal with rejection  Why is that such a key thing for founders   Elizabeth  Rejectionathon is a side project of mine  It s an event I ve done a couple of times now  and you just put yourself out there   The impetus was from when I was starting LaunchBit  I come from an engineering background  so I had no background in sales and no inclination to do sales  Unfortunately  or fortunately  when you re thrown into your startup  you have to sell  You don t have any other choice  and so that was the situation that I was in  I was extremely scared to even just talk to anybody  let alone sell ads  which is what I had to do   Over the course of the next few years  I actually became pretty good at it  but I figure you don t have to do a startup for a few years to try to build a thicker skin  That s why I started this  All founders need this skill set  even if you don t have an outbound sales process  Even for fundraising in itself  talking with potential partners  or even just hiring people  this is a very useful skill set for founders   John  What kind of situations do put people in to give them that feeling   Elizabeth  Nothing s illegal  but some of these things will definitely put you out of your comfort zone for various reasons  One thing that s just really plain hard to do is to try to borrow  50 from a stranger and then return it  That s just very difficult  but then there are also weirder things  like  ask somebody to smell you and make sure that your deodorant is working  It ranges  but it s all a little crazy  Frankly  we put everyone in teams for this event  so it s a little bit easier  and people can support each other  There s no way individuals would just do this in their free time   John  You write a lot about how to get the attention of investors in a very nuts and bolts  best practices way  It reminded me of being a journalist and advising people on how to get the attention of someone who s really busy and time poor  It really seems to boil down to be persistent  but don t be rude  Is that what you see   Elizabeth  I think being persistent is great  and actually  investors like it  Don t feel like you re bothering them  What I would not do is say   Hey  why haven t you responded to my email   or anything like that  Just pretend they never got your email  and chances are they probably never read your email  You d be surprised the number of emails that just flood my inbox every day  and I m pretty on top of my email  but it s just hard   John  Is email even the best way to get a VC s attention these days   Elizabeth  You have to try a lot of different channels  For some VCs it s email  but investors are on all the channels  because this is their job  You ve got people on Snapchat  I get pings on Facebook Messenger  picking up the phone  everything   Fighting stereotypes as a founder  John  You raised  1 million for LaunchBit  but you said you much preferred selling the product than trying to sell the company to investors  Selling the product to customers is a lot easier  What kind of VC behaviors did you see that you found particularly troubling   Elizabeth  There s my own personal experience  and then there s also experiences from friends that I ve heard of  From my perspective on LaunchBit  probably the most egregious thing I faced was in a meeting with an angel investor  I was pitching him on my company  and at the end of the meeting I asked   So what do you think   I kid you not he said   I don t want to say the wrong thing and call you a meek Asian woman  but I question how you ll lead a company of a hundred people   I had to take a second to process this  because I could not believe what I was hearing  I d never heard anything like this before  and then my next reaction was  gosh  I better come up with a good response right  because otherwise  I will seem like a meek Asian woman   Things like that come up all the time  I know women who have been touched in inappropriate places  We had a portfolio founder who asked me for some advice on a borderline situation  which was an investor that said   Hey  I want to invest  I think you re so smart  and sexy   so it was like he was mixing in good  professional qualities with inappropriate adjectives  There are a lot of borderline situations  and I don t have great advice for what you do in those situations  because sometimes you just got to take the money and roll with it  but this is very common   John  Isn t it a big problem as well that people have tendencies to pattern match others out  Even if there isn t overt sexism  someone might say   Well  you re not the typical white  20 something Stanford grad   and therefore they re going to ask inappropriate questions  or be unsure of how to evaluate you   Elizabeth  To be honest  although I was pretty angry and obviously the comment that angel investor made to me was inappropriate  when I stopped to think about it  in some sense he had done me a bit of a favor  As inappropriate as the situation was  maybe that s what other people were thinking  and so  from that point on I made an extra concerted effort to be louder  sit up straight and use better eye contact  and my fundraising process went a lot better from that point on  So there may be pattern matching happening there that other people are just keeping to themselves   VC is all a game of outliers  You just can t pattern match   To your point  yes  there s a lot of pattern matching  I actually think that s ludicrous in the VC industry  When I first came into 500 Startups on the investor side  I thought   Oh  it d be amazing to look at all this data  We have 1 600 portfolio companies  Let s see if we can find trends to see what makes for a successful company    As it turns out  VC is all a game of outliers  the very rare hits  So many random things can happen  and you just can t pattern match  That s the irony of it all   John  So in fact  they re doing themselves a disservice  You need people with different experiences and from different backgrounds   Elizabeth  Yeah  and at the end of the day  even if you have a smart team with a great opportunity  it s a lot of luck  too   John  Eoghan McCabe  our CEO  is a big fan of asking for recruitment help from people he s actually really interested in hiring  It s how we landed our VP of engineering  Darragh Curran  for instance  You wrote a great post recently about why  when you re fundraising  you have to be very clear about what you want  There s no point in going to angels asking for advice on fundraising  Ask them for an investment  if that s what you want   Elizabeth  I like Eoghan s approach for hiring  Where the analogy breaks down for fundraising is that if you are an investor  and you re trying to decide whether or not to invest  you ll need to know a lot of details about the company  such as how much revenue they re doing  their growth  etc  and those are usually things that don t come up in a casual conversation about advice  In contrast  someone who may be interested in taking a job at your startup  they may be willing to take that job without knowing what your growth rate or revenue level is   Maybe they should or shouldn t  I m not sure  but the level of due diligence that a job seeker or would be potential candidate would do with your company is not at the same level as an investor  so that s why it doesn t quite apply  Also  it s very difficult  unless you re talking about an investment  to get into the conversation of such detailed nuances about your company   Where early stage investors see value  John  Effectively  angel investors  once upon a time  were people who were relatively wealthy  At this stage  with syndicates and things like that  a lot of angels are upper middle class people who probably work at tech companies and have some money  Basically  they re playing with their pension  right   Elizabeth  Exactly  we have several 500 founders who are by no means wealthy  they haven t exited at all  but they might invest  1 000   5 000 in a company  To your point  if you do that a handful of times  that s equivalent to investing in your retirement  so they don t necessarily see themselves as investors   John  At 500 Startups  you put a high value on potential investments having their unit metrics in good shape  What does a founder need to show you to prove they re tracking the right KPIs closely  and what are those KPIs   Elizabeth  That will vary from company to company  but as a vast generalization  most people who are selling something  one of their KPIs will be related to revenue  It could be revenue  If you re marketplace  it could be gross merchandise volume  It really depends  but it s probably tied to money   What s important  along those lines as well is  how much does it cost you to get that customer who s paying you  and how much is that customer paying you at the end of the day  For pure consumer companies  such as Pinterest or Instagram  it s a little bit different  But for revenue generating companies  those are the kinds of unit economics we re looking for founders to have a solid understanding of   John  You ll quiz them and make sure that it s a solid understanding  I presume  It s not just a baseline understanding   Elizabeth  There are varying levels of sophistication  and it isn t so much about the founder s smarts  but more about their level of sophistication with their knowledge of their current business  When you first start  you have no idea how much your customer is worth  You can make some assumptions  but  you need to be able to  separate what you actually know and what you think will hold true six months or a year from now  Obviously  the more data you have around what you know is our preference  but we know that lots of things will change over time   John  Are there particular verticals  or particular trends  that you re excited about at the moment  which you think are a good fit for 500   Elizabeth  We tend not to look at trends and look more at the individual businesses  That being said  there are certain spaces that are hot and we tend to see more founders chasing after certain trends  One trend in B2B is the verticalization and segmentation of marketing automation or sales automation   Just about every vertical   it could be boring industries like  say  construction   that previously didn t have any software  now  there are a lot of people providing software for them  The next step will be more specific software for particular use cases in these verticals  such as not just generic  broad marketing automation  but maybe marketing automation for e commerce  We re already seeing a lot of players in that  but there ll be other verticals as well   John  Do you think the founders need to come from the vertical in those cases  We re definitely are seeing a lot more non technical founders   Elizabeth  Yeah  and I think that s fine  because the development of software these days is not as complex as it used to be  compared to the  90s  That being said  having domain experience is really good  because it allows you to really understand the problem  It s super important to know exactly what you re solving   not just a general idea of what you re solving  but exactly what you re going after  People who come up with a random idea and then go after it  that doesn t last very long unless you have a real dedicated interest in it   The difficulty of the side project  John  You ve also written quite a bit about side projects  and it s something we see a lot  People say   I m working at my day job  but my startup is a side project  Can you really do that and build something sustainable  or grow something  Is a side project just really a distraction   Elizabeth  There are two stages  One is you re working at your day job  Maybe it s some big  slow company  and you are working nights and weekends on your startup  That s perfectly legit  because in the beginning  you don t quite know the details of what you re going after exactly  and you may need extra time  It may not make sense for you to jump ship right now if it doesn t seem like you re even close to product market fit  And from a practical standpoint  a lot of people need to get paid   That being said  no investor will fund you until you re full time and all in on this  That s fine  Some things are meant to stay as side projects  and that s something you ll discover too   What I think is a little bit more risky is if you are running a startup  and you also have a side project going on  That s tough  because your startup really needs your attention  Where it makes sense to do a side project  in that case  is if your existing startup is not going anywhere  and you need to pivot or experiment  Then of course it makes sense  It s like you re starting over  but with some baseline knowledge this time   John  You ve said a common mistake is people waiting too long to release  because it s not perfect  If you re trying to do that  the side hustle  it s going to distract you  Will you ever release anything   Elizabeth  Side hustles need a lot of discipline  because it can be easy to say   I m too tired from my job today  I m not going to work on it   or you work on the wrong things like needing to incorporate or whatnot  It s really important to have specific goals if you have the intention of turning it into the company  Of course  if you just want it as your side hustle  that s also fine  It s just a different thing   John  Absolutely  Okay  Elizabeth  it s been a really fascinating chat  Thanks for talking with us today   Elizabeth  Thanks  John,"[161

 So WTF happened  Why no winter   Actually  winter did come and I have the data that shows it  But the reality is that  global warming  massively blunted the effects of winter and my prognosis for VC fundings of entrepreneurs in 2017 2018 is now very sunny indeed  Unless of course something Trumps our good weather   WINTER  For starters when we conducted our annual VC   LP survey in December of 2016 to prepare our annual Upfront State of the VC Industry report we found that twice as many VCs cut their investments in 2016 relative to 2015 with   30  of VCs having cut investments   And it s not just that VCs cut their investment pace but they also indicated overwhelmingly that valuations of investments had dropped with 76  of all VCs surveyed suggesting 2016 had lower valuations than 2015   So VCs made fewer investments at lower prices and generally on terms that were more favorable to investors relative to 2015  This past year was also the year that startup boards also got more disciplined about containing burn rates and pushing for companies to be run more pragmatically  With nearly 2 3rd of all VCs citing cost cutting in 2016 as the norm   this is a clear indication that winter made an appearance   So if funding from VCs slowed  valuations dropped and burn rates were slashed  WTF happened to winter again    GLOBAL  Warming  The first thing that s clear is that global investors from China  Singapore  UAE  Saudi Arabia  Japan and elsewhere stepped in to fill the gap that was initially created by the VC pull back   One stark graph should give you a sense of the picture  Chinese Foreign Direct Investment  FDI  excluding real estate  skyrocketed in 2016 as Chinese investors seek diversification out of their domestic markets  While this is total FDI as opposed to just venture  it should give you an indication of the international trend   And while the US had FANG  Facebook  Amazon Apple  Netflix and Google  China has BAT  Baidu  Alibaba and Tencent   Baidu alone raised  3 2 billion in venture capital funds with one A round fund and one late stage fund  In case you re keeping score at home   that s approximately the size of 65 US seed stage funds managed by one company   Alibaba invested  800 million in just one deal   Magic Leap and Temasik  Singapore sovereign wealth fund  invested  800 million in Verily  Those two investments represent the equivalent of another 32 US seed stage funds just in two deals   WeWork raised  690 million from Chinese investors  NextVR  80 million and Meta AR  50 million  In fact there are now so many Chinese VC funds chasing returns and also with the mandate to bring US innovation back to China that it would require an entire presentation just to talk about them all   But it s not just China and Singapore  Saudi s PIF   UAE s Mubadala teamed up with Japan s SoftBank to launch a new  100 billion fund  With oil prices dropping it s clear that the region also had to diversify assets and also bring innovation back to their doorsteps  Perhaps this is why the Kuwait Investment Authority put  165 million into Jawbone and Saudi s PIF put  3 5 billion into Uber   GLOBAL seems here to stay unless something stupid Trump s it   Global  WARMING   But  global  isn t the only story  warning is at least half of the equation   One big factor that is helping to push the VC markets is that frankly many other asset classes don t have the return profiles asset managers desire given the perpetually low interest rates and 77  of LPs   VCs we surveyed felt this was a significant contributor to the booming VC markets   And while VCs had pulled back in 2016 it wasn t only foreign investors who filled in the gap  One major group that has ramped up its venture investments have been corporates  Of course there s the usual suspects like Google  Intel  Salesforce com and Qualcomm but the total number of corporate VCs has more than doubled in the past 4 years from 61 major programs to 131   So you have GM investing  500 million in Lyft  BMW starting a  530 million venture fund  Comcast NBCU investing  200 million into BuzzFeed and even Sesame Street now has a venture capital fund   And while twice as many VCs dialed back investments in 2016 over 2015 it was the exact opposite for Corporate VCs  CVCs  who filled in the gap for the market  And more than 50  of CVCs said they plan to invest even more in 2017   Corporations in the past 18 months have not only ramped up venture capital investments but they ve also picked up the pace of mega deals to buy startup companies and often from companies not always associated with big tech purchases like Unilever buying DollarShaveClub for  1 billion  go LA   or Walmart buying Jet for  3 billion  We all know that M A begets more venture investing   While the M A story has been widely reported perhaps far fewer people know that Limited Partners  LPs   the people who fund VC firms  have finally been able to restock their coffers in the past 4 years with significantly more money coming to them in distributions than capital calls to fund VC firm investments  This chart surprised me the most   When LPs get distributions back they reinvest it into new asset programs in a diversified manner but when VC investments are yielding higher returns than other asset classes even this percentage is getting bigger so VCs are not only able to more easily raise funds but they re also getting a large slice of the pie  It should therefore come as no surprise that both the number of funds and the amount of dollars raised have both doubled   And while this author would find it hard to ever say anything positive about the current president of the United States there is perhaps one decision that he seems likely to take that would likely benefit the US technology sector   a tax holiday on the repatriation of foreign capital  Many tech companies have earned huge profits overseas and since there is a tax on bringing it back into the US they leave it abroad  We estimate that the top 5 US tech firms have more than  500 billion in cash sitting abroad and if this is brought back to the US it is likely to increase  R D expenditure  M A deals and Venture Capital financings   So if I had to sum up for you what I see coming in the next two year s of VC financings and why it will likely be a great time to be an entrepreneur in the US in 2017 2018 it s this  But while funding for VCs and funding for tech startups should remain robust  funding is not the same thing as returns  And if the industry becomes over funded I suspect it will lead to bad behavior at startups  bad behavior at VCs and thus overall depressed returns relative to smaller funding cycles  But this is normal business known as an  economic cycle    If you want to read the full report it is here on SlideShare  We will also be publishing the full VC Survey and LP Survey over the course of the next couple of weeks,"[182 545 654 1 1378 398 1084 752 751 774 932]"

211,training-dataset/business/187.txt,business,Why Silicon Valley WorksI wrote this for the FT  but it s behind a paywall  Since I wrote it  I feel like it s probably ok for me to post it here   The natural state of a start up is to die  most start ups require multiple miracles in their early days to escape this fate  But the density and breadth of the Silicon Valley network does sometimes let start ups cheat death     Silicon Valley works because there is such a high density of people working on start ups and they are inclined to help each other  Other tech hubs have this as well but this is a case of Metcalfe s law   the utility of a network is proportional to the square of the number of nodes on the network  Silicon Valley has far more nodes in the network than anywhere else   One of the biggest misconceptions about us is that you need to have pre existing connections to get value from the network  Remarkably  you don t  Silicon Valley is a community of outsiders that have come together  If you build something good  people will help you  It s standard practice to ask people you ve just met for help   and as long as you aren t annoying about it  they usually don t mind   I run Y Combinator  an investment firm that gives a small amount of money and a lot of advice to a large number of start ups  We do this in batches twice a year  Our network works because it has very strong connections  Founders are generally closer to their earliest investors and less close to their later investors  They are closest of all to the peers they were around when struggling to get their start  Therefore  YC founders are typically willing to do anything they can to help another YC founder  Sometimes this is being a customer or investing  sometimes it s referring a candidate  sometimes it s advice and investor connections  Often it s just moral support   I often ask founders what surprised them most about going through YC  and a common answer is the degree to which YC is a  meta company   Yes  the approximately 700 YC companies are all totally independent legal entities   but the connection is so strong that alumni companies get significant benefits from each other  Most YC founders tell us they get more help from other YC founders than all other friends of the company  advisors and investors put together  Most will try a product from another YC company before deciding to use one outside the network   This seems like the future to me   large groups of independent companies  loosely tied together   One question I get asked a lot is how to replicate the success of Silicon Valley elsewhere  Most people realise that the world of start ups benefits tremendously from network effects  and think it sounds impossible to replicate the necessary density anywhere else  But my experience suggests it s probably doable with a few thousand people and a reasonable amount of capital   I think you need two other things  an area where many ambitious people care most about start ups and technology  and a focus on long term compensation  In most cities  there s one field that dominates the conversation   finance in New York  politics in DC  movies in LA and start ups in San Francisco  If start ups are second fiddle  it will be challenging to replicate the environment of Silicon Valley   The focus in Silicon Valley on long term compensation is also important  Nearly everyone wants to get rich but they re willing to wait to do so  Conspicuous consumption isn t that cool  not too many people drive Ferraris or talk about their vacation homes  Unlike other cities where people are mostly focused on cash compensation for this year  in Silicon Valley more people talk about equity than salaries  assuming  of course  that they can afford the wildly out of control housing costs  which is probably the biggest weakness here right now   A focus on making a lot of money in the long term at the expense of short term opportunities is essential to building companies that have a huge impact   they take a long time,"[211 286 96 622 33 545 31 779 1 415 856]"
238,training-dataset/business/348.txt,business,How Angel Investors Value Pre Revenue Startups  Part I How Angel Investors Value Pre Revenue Startups  Part I   Scorecard Valuation Method  It s always an interesting discussion when valuing early stage startups without existing revenue  Fundamentally  valuing a startup is very different than valuing an established company  Quantitative analysis and financial projections don t always predict the future success of the early stage startup which is why some angel investors put greater value in the entrepreneur and management team  There is no one way to determine the pre money valuation  the startup s value before receiving outside investment  for a startup so it s wise to gain insights on valuation methodologies from other entrepreneurs and angel investors   In a series of three posts I ll be sharing three pre money valuation methods often used by angel investors  Below  I ll take you through the first installment of determining pre money valuations with the Scorecard Valuation Method   Scorecard Valuation Method  The Scorecard Valuation  also known as the Bill Payne valuation method  is one of the most preferred methodologies used by angels  This method compares the startup  raising angel investment  to other funded startups modifying the average valuation based on factors such as region  market and stage   The first step is to determine the average pre money valuation for pre revenue startups  Angel groups tend to examine pre money valuations across regions as a good baseline  For instance  Bill Payne published a Scorecard Valuation Methodology Worksheet where he surveyed 13 angel groups in 2010  displaying a pre money valuation range between  1M  2M  Competition in different regions can vary sometimes leaning to higher valuations so the data could be skewed at the upper range of the data set  The value that appeared most often in Payne s set of data was  1 5M which he uses as the average pre money valuation   I recommend AngelList as a great resource to explore startup valuation data from thousands of startups  You can browse valuations by location  market  quarter  and founder background   The next step is to compare the startup to the perception of other startups within the same region using factors such as   Strength of the Management Team  0 30    Size of the Opportunity  0 25    Product Technology  0 15    Competitive Environment  0 10    Marketing Sales Channels Partnerships  0 10    Need for Additional Investment  0 5    Other  0 5    The ranking of these factors is highly subjective  but the main emphasis besides scalibility is on the team  Payne states   In building a business  the quality of the team is paramount to success  A great team will fix early product flaws  but the reverse is not true    Lastly  it s time to calculate the percentage weights  Below is a table that Payne uses in his worksheet   Payne assumes the team is strong  125  comparison  with a huge market opportunity  150  comparison   However  the startup is playing in a highly competitive environment  75    By multiplying the sum factor  1 0750  by the average pre money valuation   1 5M  we arrive with a pre money valuation of roughly  1 6M for the target startup   The Scorecard Valuation Method is certainly subjective  but given the risk undertaken by angel investors  this approach makes sense for investing in early stage startups  I particularly appreciate this method due to the special importance on the team  Understanding this method is also important for founders to know how to negotiate valuations with investors,"[238 545 943 29 243 711 470 210 856 842 1]"

263,training-dataset/business/679.txt,business,Network Effects   The Keys to Ascending the Consumer Internet Throne Category kings   defined as market share leaders in particular business sectors  often wind up creating the majority of the market value relative to their competition  This advantage is particularly pronounced in technology  According to some research  over 70  of the value created in technology markets is actually generated by the category s king  think Amazon com in retail  Facebook in social media  etc    In fact  research we recently conducted around this topic showed that five sixths of the market value generated by these leading tech players comes from businesses driven by  network effects   the phenomenon of a product or service becoming more valuable as more people use it   This insight is based on an analysis of companies first compiled by consultants Play Bigger Advisors  with valuations updated as of Dec  31   Our recent  more detailed analysis around network effects found that they are  in many ways  more potent than many of us have thought  They lead to more efficient sales and marketing activity  create strong barriers to competition  and can lead to explosive growth as a category king s base of users grows at a fast rate   Today there is a new class of prominent network effect companies such as Airbnb  Uber and Snapchat  all potential IPOs in the next 12 to 18 months  Snapchat s parent has already filed for its offering  that have created and dominated enormous winner take most markets  including lodging and transportation   These companies  success and increasing visibility prompted us to try to quantify the specific value of network effects in consumer technology markets  particularly among category kings  One of our outputs is the new Battery Ventures Network Effect Index  which we are launching today and will update regularly  We believe the index and its related data hold insights to better understand the network effect economy   The index is a market cap weighted group of 36 current or previously publicly traded consumer Internet companies  each valued at  1 billion or more  as of 12 31 16   whose business model can in whole or in part be attributed to network effects  As you can see from the chart below  the stocks of companies in the BNI have together risen by 161  and outperformed the S P by 84  over the last five years  and outperformed the tech heavy NASDAQ by 60   This means that if you invested  1000 in this basket of companies in 2011  you would have about  2606 today   The combined value of all the companies in our index is  1 08 trillion  and the average time from founding to IPO was 8 0 years  compared to a broader average of 11 years for venture backed companies   Here is a list of all 36 current or previously public companies that comprise the index   Our index includes three discrete categories of companies   Transactional Marketplaces   Destinations where sellers and consumers meet to buy products or services  Examples here are travel site Priceline  food delivery service GrubHub  and Chinese e commerce site Alibaba   Ad Driven Marketplaces   These companies like Zillow  Yelp and TripAdvisor let consumers use the service for free  but try to get sellers  real estate agents  dry cleaners  hotels  to buy ads to fund the content   Social Networks   Prominent companies in this category include Facebook  Snapchat and WhatsApp   Below is a look at how the stocks of these three different types of network effect companies have performed over the last five years   As expected  the social networks in the index performed exceedingly well  driven by the growth of companies like Facebook  Tencent  LinkedIn and others  increasing 254  over the five year period  Interestingly  ad driven marketplaces also performed well against the indices  and even relative to their transactional marketplace counterparts  Ad driven marketplaces beat the S P 500 by 57  and even the tech heavy NASDAQ by 32   suggesting that their network effects enabled them to grow even in the public markets   There were several other  high level takeaways from our research   Market size matters  According to our research  consumer transactional marketplaces generally can t hit warp speed unless the total market they re going after is worth  50 billion  yes  billion  or more  So while a  1 billion target market may sound great in a startup pitch deck  a much larger   50 billion addressable market is what most companies in our index needed to create a consumer marketplace valued at  1 billion or more  That isn t to say they didn t start smaller in a niche market   Homeaway with vacation homes  Opentable with restaurant reservations  Uber with black cars  However  as they grew  they moved into adjacent but related markets that could grow their TAM  total addressable market  to more than  50 billion   It s important to note that the TAM rule is different for the three types of network effect businesses  The social networks we studied generally operate in enormous markets in which demand for the service is almost limitless  as in all people   The ad driven marketplace companies in our index  on the other hand  are going after relatively smaller advertising markets  which are often subsets of a broader transactional market   For example  online review site Yelp operates in the market for restaurants  but can only command a small part of the revenue it drives  since it makes money by accepting advertising from local businesses and is not directly involved in actual transactions  Restaurant meal delivery service GrubHub  on the other hand  takes a cut of all deliveries  which we believe is a better business model  since it s sitting directly in the flow of a critical transaction  Thus  even though Grubhub is facing severe competition from many players while Yelp has a quasi monopoly  the companies have similar market caps  High performing and valuable businesses can still be built via an ad model look at Zillow  real estate  and Tripadvisor  travel  but these have to nail the consumer value proposition for massive categories   Tip  Find a  shadow market   One way to unlock a huge market is to find a hidden  shadow market  existing in a corner of the economy  Both Airbnb and Uber are great examples of this  Who knew anyone with a spare bedroom could become a hotel  and anyone with a car could function as a taxi service  Essentially  these marketplaces unlocked brand new supply and demand and enabled almost magical new behavior from consumers  Obviously  the companies in these sectors are now reaping the rewards  Though not included in our index  up and comers exemplifying this include Rover  which has unlocked a new supply of pet boarding  and Catalant  which is tapping a new supply of consultants   Companies serving smaller markets can still succeed they may just need a winner take all monopoly to create multi billion dollar value  Just Eat  the GrubHub of the U K  and Europe  and REA Group  the Zillow of Australia  are great examples of companies that have taken smaller markets and owned them to reach the throne   When figuring out a business model  carefully analyze supply and demand  To build a billion dollar business  we think one key decision for executives of consumer marketplaces is deciding which side to charge for their service  In general  our research suggests that companies should levy a fee on the side of the transaction that is less constrained  either there are more of them in the marketplace  or the side that wants access to the service more    For example  Airbnb  valued at  30 billion  as of Dec  31  according to TechCrunch  from the onset elected to charge consumers  not homeowners  since the consumers were the ones who desperately needed places to stay in busy cities with packed  and expensive  hotels  On the other hand  early market entrant HomeAway  which was valued at about  4 billion as of its acquisition by Expedia  charged homeowners to list their properties online  This could be one reason HomeAway didn t capture more of the market  despite having first mover advantage  Airbnb  meanwhile  captured much more housing inventory  and this allowed the company to offer a more compelling service   Sales and marketing spending is key  Finally  we believe there can be a relationship between sales and marketing spend and network effects among the companies in our index  Alibaba  a shining example of strong network effects  is worth  220 billion  as of Dec  31  and spends less than 15  of its revenues on sales and marketing  But childcare and elder care marketplace Care com  valued at  247 million as of Dec  31  spends over 48  of its revenues on sales and marketing  Finding babysitters or elder care is  after all  a relatively episodic need  and there is a high risk of disintermediation  yielding a marketplace with weaker network effects  As a result  Care com needs to spend more on sales and marketing to maintain growth   Overall  we believe the network effect is more relevant than ever to future startup success  But the playbook is changing rapidly  What worked to create a network effect yesterday isn t guaranteed to  kill it  tomorrow and savvy entrepreneurs will have to work hard to keep up    Denotes a current or former Battery

update on our progress   Our mission is to enable the most innovation of any company in the world in order to make the future great for everyone  We believe new technology  economic growth  and new ideas about how our society might function are more important than ever before   As of January 1  2017  YC has funded over 3 200 founders and 1 470 companies  This year  assuming there is not a macroeconomic meltdown  we expect the total valuation of companies that have gone through our program to surpass  100 billion  We have also funded more than 30 non profits   As always  most of the credit goes to our founders they  and the astonishingly strong and helpful community they create  are what make YC special  The second most credit goes to our team I am incredibly thankful to work with such a talented and driven group of people   YC Companies   Investments  We invested about  27 million in the Winter and Summer 2016 batches  and so far we have invested about  187 million in later stage investments from our first Continuity fund   We are excited to fund companies in any space that we believe is good for the world and can eventually sustain a very large company  Some of the many areas we re interested in are noted in our Requests for Startups   Our largest exit of 2016 was Cruise  a self driving car company  We expect to fund many more machine learning driven companies in the future  I will generally avoid calling out trends in these letters  because I ve noticed doing that produced unintended consequences  but this one is so obvious and so important that I m happy to mention it    Helion  Oklo  and Bright are all working toward inexpensive clean energy  an area of great interest to us  LendUp and Coinbase are two examples of YC companies innovating in financial services technology  Boom and Relativity Space are pursuing strategies in aerospace that most companies haven t pursued seriously in a long time  or ever     Gingko Bioworks is learning how to design new organisms  and Science Exchange is making it easier to get new experiments done  FarmLogs is making it easier and more efficient to grow food  and Gobble  Instacart and Doordash are making it easier to eat it  Reddit and 9Gag continue to make me waste enormous amounts of time  but I love every minute I waste   Docker  PlanGrid  Checkr  Flexport  Gusto are just a few of the enterprise companies we ve seen begin to thrive  Machine Zone has become one of the largest gaming companies in the world  Rappi  Wave  and Strikingly are some of the many YC companies succeeding on other continents   In addition to the three companies we are currently best known for Airbnb  Dropbox and Stripe more than 50 of our companies are worth more than  100 million each   We ve funded a lot of other companies  but in the spirit of not exhausting your patience  I ll stop listing them here   Hyperscale  There s one more trend I want to mention  though it s not about a specific market  I think we re now in the era of hyperscale technology companies  If you believe Metcalfe s law  it stands to reason that network effected technology companies are now far more powerful than ever before  simply because the number of people connected to the internet keeps getting bigger  and n 2 gets big really fast   Companies like Amazon  Facebook  Google  Apple  and Microsoft have powerful advantages that are still not fully understood by most founders and investors  I expect that they will continue to do a lot of things well  have significant data and computation advantages  be able to attract a large percentage of the most talented engineers  and aggressively buy companies that get off to promising starts  This trend is unlikely to reverse without antitrust action  and I suggest people carefully consider its implications for startups  There will of course be areas where these companies are naturally weaker  and these are good areas to start companies   Diversity   Inclusion  In 2016  we funded 68 female founders at 52 companies  About 22 3  of the companies we funded had a woman on the founding team  and about 12 5  of the founders we funded were women  In 2016  we funded 52 Black and Latino founders at 29 companies  11 6  of the founders we funded were Black or Latino   The percentage of women who apply to YC is roughly the same as the percentage of women who get funded  The same is true for Black and Latino founders   From the data we have available  it seems that the percentage of women and people of color applying to YC is higher than the overall percentage of women and people of color starting startups  This is encouraging  but we continue to want to understand and address the barriers that prevent more founders from underrepresented groups from starting startups and applying to YC  We still have a long way to go   While we remain committed to helping more underrepresented founders get started  we believe that s only part of the solution  We still see significant dropoffs at the stages after YC  e g  raising late stage capital   The larger startup community needs to consider how little the unicorn founder demographics resemble the early stage demographics   There s clearly a lot more work to do here  and we re committed to help do it  We re hosting our fourth annual Female Founders Conference this year in June  continuing our Open Office Hours with underrepresented communities and bringing in unconscious bias experts to train our team  We re always open to hearing how we can do a better job  so if you ve come across practices or programs that work well to support diverse founders  please let us know   YC Organization  Y Combinator is currently made up of 5 groups  I ll talk a little about each of them here  We expect to add several more over the next few years  and in general you should expect us to try a lot of stuff  though of course not all of it will work   You should also expect us to continue to grow the number of companies we fund   YC  our flagship program   In October of 2016  Michael Seibel took over responsibility for our main program as CEO of YC  He s doing an outstanding job  and I expect the program to significantly strengthen over the course of 2017 and beyond   In 2016  and the first part of 2017   we added three remarkable partners to the flagship group  Tim Brady  Adora Cheung and Daniel Gross   One of my partners that I d like to especially thank is Dalton Caldwell  Dalton has been a YC partner since 2013  and now runs our admissions team  which is perhaps the most important function we have  Dalton has taken a process that used to be stressful and deeply imperfect and improved it by a huge amount  Though I m sure we ll still make mistakes  I sleep better at night thinking that we re making far fewer in this area than we used to   While I m on the topic of recognizing partners  I d also like to thank the three partners at YC that get some of the least public recognition  Kirsty Nathoo is our CFO  and Jon and Carolynn Levy are our General Counsels  They are full partners at YC but since they don t advise our companies  as much  on business as the other partners  they are less well known  However  they work incredibly hard and thoughtfully  and they are one of the secrets to our success  In fact  one of our most successful founders recently said to me  I tell every startup I meet they should do YC  and the reason is Jon Levy  I don t get how he managed to take my calls at all hours of the day  because the other founders in my batch said he did the same for them  but he solved more problems for us than I can count  and also just listened to me when I had a bad day    Finally  I d like to thank our entire software team  lead by my partner Jared Friedman  We ve had an incredible improvement in our software over the past year  and someday when the history of YC is written  I expect that people will talk about software as one of our secret weapons  This shouldn t be so secret one might reasonably expect technology investors to understand the importance of great software for themselves but it is generally not the case   We give companies in this program  120k for 7  ownership in their company  and work with them intensively for 3 months and then less intensively for the rest of the company s life  We run this program twice a year  and currently fund about 125 companies per batch  While at YC  founders get access to a range of resources  advice  connections  and special deals   Anyone can apply on our website  and all sorts of people do  here are some common misconceptions about who YC accepts    Companies often ask us how we decide who gets into YC  There are four questions I consider   1  Will this company build something lots of people really love   If so  and if  lots  is sufficiently large  the company has the chance to produce substantial earnings   2  Will this company be easy to copy   The most successful companies I ve worked with have a significant competitive advantage network effect  proprietary technology  complex coordination  or barrier to entry of some other sort  I understand in theory it s possible to build a very successful commodity company  but I don t know how to do it   3  Will these founders develop into  forces of nature    As most people say  it s hard to make money unless you invest in great founders  Defining what that means is usually left as an exercise to the reader  Here are some questions I ask myself  Are these founders relentlessly determined  Are they original thinkers  Are they smart  and especially do they have new insights I haven t heard before  Are they good communicators  and so will they be able to hire  sell  raise money  talk to the press  etc   Are they focused and intense  Do they always seem to find a way around obstacles  Would I work for them   This is the often the hardest factor for me to evaluate  because you have to make a judgment about trajectory you are trying to predict where someone will be in five years   4  Does this company have a clear and important mission   Without this  I usually get bored  More importantly  companies that don t have this usually have a hard time recruiting enough great people to work with them  and thus struggle to become very large   We especially like founders who have some sort of non traditional background  we are somewhat suspicious of founders with extremely  tracked  lives  Startups are not a resume item  and we don t like founders who view YC as a stop on the way to B school  Although in many ways it s a good problem to have  the increase in the value of YC s brand means we have to work harder to find people doing a startup for the right reason  to bring an idea they re obsessed with to life  and willing to do something unreasonable to see it happen   We have had great success funding  unknown  people  and we will keep doing this it s one of our two or three best secrets  Please help us spread the message  you don t need to be experienced  well known  or have an impressive resume to get into YC  We fund smart  ambitious people with a great idea and evidence that they can build things   If you know a founder who should apply to YC  you can recommend them to us  That said  companies don t need a recommendation or introduction  and most companies we fund don t have one   As I mentioned before  I think the strength and quality of our community is one of the most important things we have to offer  As with any community  this emerges from a complex set of factors  but I ll mention three here   One of the most important cultural values PG and Jessica put in place was to do the right thing for founders  even when it is not in our own short term interest  When I was going through YC  it was the thing that most stuck out to me as different from other investors   Another cultural value they created is to try to fund only good people  in the sense of doing the right thing  though separately we evaluate for effectiveness   We sometimes get this very wrong  and dealing with the repercussions is the most unpleasant part of our job  However  we manage to get it right a lot   Thirdly  we have a  pay it forward  mentality  Startups in the batch know they can ask any alumni for help  well beyond normal Silicon Valley expectations  Later  when they re successful alumni  they help new companies without us ever asking     YC Continuity  YC Continuity is our growth stage fund  We started it in 2015  and it s run by Ali Rowghani  Last year  Anu Hariharan joined as our second YC Continuity partner   We do this to provide a source of friendly growth stage capital to companies and founders that go through the YC program  especially to companies that other investors may not fully understand  We also hope to be a force for good in the growth stage investing market   YC Continuity will begin to experiment with programs to provide more advice and resources to growth stage companies in 2017   YC Research  YC Research is a non profit research division of YC  Although we think startups are a good structure to align people to solve a problem  they are clearly not the best solution for everything  For some important problems  a non profit research lab is a good approach   We sometimes fund and run internal groups  and sometimes fund external organizations   So far there are 5 groups  Basic Income  OpenAI  HARC  New Cities  and Universal Healthcare   Basic Income is studying the effects of giving people unconditional monthly cash  We are currently in our pilot phase in Oakland  We are continuing to learn and make changes  and work with various public agencies and governments to enable the full scale study  We are planning to run a larger study than we originally intended  and we hope to start fundraising for it soon   OpenAI is trying to develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity  In our first year  we released Gym  Universe  and a number of new ideas that were at the limits of my understanding but that I enjoyed reading about  In 2017  we hope to achieve significant new milestones that are not possible with current AI technology   HARC is a group headed by Alan Kay inventing new ways for humans to learn and understand more  My visit to Bret Victor s lab last year  which is a sort of computerized interactive room  remains one of the new technologies I think most about   New Cities is still in the exploration phase  but we hope to have more to share over the course of this year   Universal Healthcare is a project on which we are partnering with Watsi to study how we can use technology to make healthcare both better and more affordable   We grew a little faster than we were expecting  so we are trying to take a breather on further growth at YCR  But we may still add one more group in 2017   Startup School  Startup School is our new MOOC  which we will supplement with our existing series of conferences   It will be open to anyone  unless we get absolutely overwhelmed with interest  and is free  We will stream talks like the ones that happen during YC dinners  provide advice to startups  and help them connect to other startups in the program and other people that may be helpful   Although we clearly stand to gain from this  we are doing it because we believe spreading the message about entrepreneurship and making the necessary information  community  and connections freely accessible to everyone who might want to start a company is important   This year  I ll be teaching it   If this goes well  we hope to offer it every year  In future years  we also hope to explore how something like  financial aid  might work for people that need a small amount of capital to help get their startup going   Hacker News  Hacker News  HN  is an internet forum  created by Paul Graham shortly after YC got started and now run by Daniel Gackle  Its original purpose was to try out the programming language PG was developing a dialect of Lisp called Arc  that HN still proudly uses today and to be a place to find interesting things to read   HN s initial users were fans of the essays PG had been publishing about startups  programming  and a lot of other things  Soon it became a hub for everyone interested in YC and startups YC was funding  YC and HN grew up together  and many YC founders started as HN users   HN remains focused on startups  programming  and lots of other things anything intellectually interesting goes  The HN community has developed many unique features over the years  such as the  Show HN  format  where users share something they ve made  and monthly  Who Is Hiring  threads that have helped many community members find jobs   Hacker News has 3 4 million users per month and 350 000 users per day  with 4 million pageviews a day  There are just under 1 million registered accounts  with several hundred added each day  Users post around 1 000 articles and 6 000 comments to the site per day   These numbers are all growing  but relatively slowly  and we like it that way  Internet forums are notorious for degrading over time  one of the ways PG described HN was as an experiment in seeing how long a forum could stay good before it deteriorated  We ve mostly managed to stave that off  for 10 years now  but we re always mindful of this risk   HN has grown into the leading community for tech and startups on the internet  known for its emphasis on civil  substantive discussion at least in theory  Our team affectionately refers to HN as  the worst internet forum  except for all the others                   We are only about 30 years into the age of software  about 20 years into the age of the internet  and about 2 years into the age of artificial intelligence  Each of these by themselves is a technology revolution that I believe we will look back on as being extremely significant  taken together  I believe they will represent the most significant technology revolution in human history I believe we are likely to have less in common with whatever we call the most intelligent species on the planet in 600 years than we did with humans 60 000 years ago   It s an exciting time to do what we do           Sam Altman  President  YC Group,"[286 96 622 211 711 545 1044 1317 1378 161 1091]"

349,training-dataset/product/1132.txt,product,Should You Give Away Equity to Build Your App The article   Should You Give Away Equity to Build Your App    by Jennifer Marsh was originally published on Designli s blog and been republished below with permission   Equity as a replacement for high priced development is a tempting proposal for a new app owner with a small budget  Some developers   freelancers  especially   will give you an estimate on costs and offer to decrease that cost in exchange for equity  The problem is that equity can be a much higher cost than upfront development fees once you look at the big picture   So should you give away equity to build your app   The answer is  it depends   Every idea and startup has its own unique factors when it comes to making decisions on equity and costs  There is no black and white answer  but you can take these considerations into account as you determine if equity is a suitable solutions for your budget and development costs   What Deal Does the Developer Want   Some developers will offer you an equity deal when you don t even ask for it  You should be careful with these types of estimates  because often the developer will inflate the costs to make the equity deal more attractive  It s good that the developer sees your idea as a valuable  worthwhile venture but this type of deal is an immediate red flag for the app owner   Usually  this means the app is still in its idea stage  so it isn t worth much at this state  You re basically trading equity in a  0 venture for development costs  The developer is truly taking the risk at this point unless you have a good business and marketing plan already in the works while you shop for a developer  Since your idea probably isn t worth much at this state  that means you re often looking at a sub par developer  read  poor end product  or some other type of scheme where there developer will put in as little work as possible to roll our your app   If the developer asks for money upfront  it s probably not in your best interest to offer equity  When developers work for equity  they work with a vested interest in seeing the app thrive  Someone who takes money upfront is likely getting their development fees and have little interest in seeing the app survive   How Much is the Current Startup Worth   Some startups already have equity built and the app creation is complete and ready for scaling  This means that the developer you bring in  in exchange for equity  will be adding to the existing app through building out new features  At this point  your app has moved on from the idea stage to the actual  in progress  or true equity stage   You know what your app and startup is worth at this point  so it s difficult to say what amount of equity is worth the trade  However  you could save on costs for a low equity trade  You would need to calculate the percentage offered based on your app s current valuation  Just remember that you re taking a co owner and partner in a development team when you give up equity  If it s a new team that acts more like a freelancer  contractor or outsourced team  it s probably best to decline this type of offer   as you re becoming truly married to a single shop or company regardless of how the relationship unfolds from there   In this type of situation  a single developer with an interest in your idea is a more attractive offer  someone you ll be able to add to your core team as part of your everyday business  without other clients or any other workload to distract them from your common goal   Are Development Costs Out of Your Budget   Ideally  paying for development costs is much better than giving up equity  When you give anyone equity  you are relying on a stranger  assumingly  to have a vested interest in your idea  This doesn t happen often  and taking on an equity partner is more likely to weigh you down rather than enrich your startup   If development costs are within your budget  strongly consider paying the developers rather than offering equity  This gives you several options should you need to change development teams or you have any creative differences with your developers   A good development team is hard to find  and you can t just sever the relationship should it go sour if you offer equity  Without any type of relationship with the developers  you should pay the fees instead of offering equity  Once you get to know them  it s possible to offer equity in the future but not blindly just to save on costs   Are You Looking for a CTO   As we said earlier in this post  an equity partner should more often than not be a single developer and not an agency  Good CTOs are hard to find  and this is where equity is good leverage when you have a limited budget but really need the expertise that only a trained CTO can bring  Not everyone is technically inclined  and a CTO can bring a valuable asset to your business   This is the one time when equity might be a good trade in exchange for costs related to developing an app  At this point  you would need to perform a serious valuation of your business before you present an equity amount  Of course  you would need to negotiate the amount with a potential CTO  and this person should be someone you know so that the amount of equity is equal to the amount of benefits that one will bring to your startup   Even with a CTO s benefits  you should still determine if your startup is ready to take on a CTO  Whether you give them equity  a salary or both it s still a big commitment and a high overhead in terms of cost  However  a vested CTO can bring valuable information  suggestions  a strong team leadership for your developers  and a CTO can drive your technology costs and efficiency down with the right business tactics   Again   this consideration should only truly be made once your initial product is built  you have a business  and you have shown the value   as any truly qualified person ready to take this role would be hesitant to do so before you have anything to show for your app idea   Is the Equity Owner Willing to Take Some of the Risk   A startup is risky  No one writes about the failures  so you typically only see amazing stories from successful entrepreneurs  It s risky  and a partial equity owner must be able to invest and take on some of the risk   Talk to the developer about your app and find out if they will take some of the risk associated with the idea  Anyone who takes equity should understand that startups are risky businesses that have high rewards but these high rewards come at a cost   All of these considerations have nuances based on your specific app or custom software project  where you are with the startup  and if you have the budget to pay upfront for its development costs  One common factor applies  though   only take equity partners that you trust and are willing to invest time and effort into your app s success   What is your experience with

founders of a company to intimately understand the company s Key Performance Indicators   KPIs    Founders cannot hope to grow a company in any meaningful way without an almost obsessive focus on its KPIs  Why  Because KPIs  if constructed correctly  give management and potential investors a cold  analytical snapshot of the state of the company  untainted by emotion or rhetoric  This focus must not be limited to the KPIs themselves  for they are merely measurements of outcomes  We look for founders to have an understanding of what levers can be pulled and what tweaks can be made to improve the business  which will then be reflected in its KPIs  So the focus should not be on the KPIs themselves  but the meaning behind them and knowing what impacts each one   Let s review some of the KPIs that we feel are important for founders to thoroughly understand and for which they should have a strategy  or set of strategies  for optimizing  Please note that some KPIs are not relevant to some types of businesses  Finally  I am not going to go into very much detail on each metric and how to calculate it as  a  that is beyond the scope of this article  and  b  that information is readily available from other sources   1  Customer Acquisition Cost   CAC    CAC is the amount of money you need to spend on sales  marketing and related expenses  on average  to acquire a new customer  This tells us about the efficiency of your marketing efforts  although it s much more meaningful when combined with some of the other metrics below and when compared to competitors  CAC   2  Acquiring new customers is one thing  but retaining them is even more important  Your Customer Retention Rate indicates the percentage of paying customers who remain paying customers during a given period of time  The converse to retention rate is Churn  or Attrition   the percentage of customers you lose in a given period of time  When we see high retention rates over an indicative time period  we know the company has a sticky product and that it is keeping its customers happy  This is also an indicator of capital efficiency   3  Lifetime Value   LTV   is the measurement of the net value of an average customer to your business over the estimated life of the relationship with your company  Understanding this number  especially in its relation to CAC  is critical to building a sustainable company   4  We consider the Ratio of CAC to LTV to be the golden metric  This is a true indicator of the sustainability of a company  If a company can predictably and repeatedly turn x into 10x  note  10x is just an illustration and not mean to imply any sort of minimum or standard   then it s sustainable   5  CAC Recovery Time  or Months to Recover CAC   This KPI measures how long it takes for a customer to generate enough net revenue to cover the CAC  CAC Recovery Time has a direct impact on cash flow and consequentially  Runway   6  Whereas CAC measures the variable expenses attributable to acquiring customers  Overhead measures the company s fixed expenses incurred irrespective of the number of customers acquired  Overhead relative to revenue is a reflection of the capital efficiency of a company  i e  all things being equal  a company that generates  1M in revenue on  200k in Overhead is twice as efficient than one that generates  1M in revenue on  400k in revenue    7  Understanding your revenue and monthly expenses  fixed and variable  enables you to calculate the company s Monthly Burn  This is simply the net amount of cash flow for a month when net cash flow is negative  If the company starts the month with  100k in cash and ends the month with  90k in cash  its burn rate is  10k  If a company s monthly net cash flow is positive  it is not burning cash   8  A keen focus on Runway is critical to the survival of any startup  Runway is the measure of the amount of time until the company runs out of cash  expressed in terms of months  Runway is computed by dividing remaining cash by Monthly Burn  We prefer to view a conservative estimate of Runway that calculates the Monthly Burn utilizing current revenue and projected expenses  after accounting for the increased expenses to be incurred post investment   We require an absolute minimum of 12 months of Runway  but have a strong preference for 18 months or more  Short Runways cause entrepreneurs to by myopic and not to have the liberty to tweak and iterate when necessary  It also forces them to almost immediately focus on the next fundraising round instead of on growing the company   9  Expressed as a percentage  Profit Margin tells us how much your product sells for above the actual cost of the product itself  Put another way  it reveals how much of the selling price is  markup   This invaluable metric allows us to consider the return on investment on the cost of the product and is significant in understanding the scalability and sustainability of the company   10  We consider Conversion Rate to be a very telling KPI in that it reveals a combination of the company s ability to sell its products to its customers and the customers  desire for the product  It is particularly instructive to track and review Conversion Rate over time and regularly run experiments to improve it   11  Certain businesses find that revenue may not be the most informative indicator of their financial performance  This is especially true for marketplaces for which revenue  i e  their take rate  represents a small portion of overall transactions  Gross Merchandise Volume   GMV   can be a useful KPI in these cases  GMV is the overall dollar value of sales of goods or services purchased through a marketplace   12  For companies that have apps  online games  or social networking sites  Monthly Active Users   MAU   is an important KPI  MAU is the number of unique users who engage with the site or app in a thirty day period  Understanding MAU is helpful in determining the revenue potential of a company or how well it is currently monetizing   When we speak to founders to learn more about their companies  we ask them for these KPIs along with their narrative and other information  It is a quick way for us to understand the current state of the business and we have serious concerns about founders who do not know their KPIs  We find that the most successful founders tend to be those who have an obsessive focus on their KPIs and the drive to constantly experiment and optimize them   Phil Nadel is the Co Founder and Managing Director of Barbara Corcoran Venture

top of the world go downhill so fast  After all  they had recently raised a  16M series C and their founder  Sophia Amoruso  had been touring the country promoting an upcoming show about her life as a young  successful business mogul  However  anybody in the startup industry knows this isn t as rare as it might seem   From Zenefits to Theranos  the stories of high profile startups who burn through millions  or even billions  of dollars before crashing to the ground are all too common  After a company hits rock bottom  post op articles seem all too happy to point out how the company screwed up  irresponsible spending  lack of management  poor business models etc  While it s easy to demonize these failures  I always feel sympathy  As a founder myself   I ve been working on BrandYourself for 7 years   going bankrupt and failing is my biggest fear   I also know first hand that focusing on profitability and sustainability is hard  especially in a landscape that incentivizes capital inefficiency  Over the last 5 years  VC Private equity has probably poured more money into private companies than ever before  They ve also become increasingly obsessed with hitting billion dollar grand slams  While access to capital is generally a good thing  this combination encourages companies to prioritize revenue customer growth even at the expense of strong unit economics  Even if a founder recognizes things need to change  it s not easy to fight against the larger market current  It s difficult to slow down and address increasing churn rates or high acquisition costs when a competitor down the street just raised a monster round to acquire all your customers  It s even harder to motivate your employees to take a  lean  mentality and tighten their belts when other companies in town are offering above market salaries and daily free lunches   The result  Many companies end up failing because of capital inefficiency not because they were bad ideas or bad companies  This trend has been written about extensively   especially over at Pando   I want to be clear  this is not an indictment against VCs  VCs are an important element of the startup ecosystem  ours are great   It just means founders need to be in the driver s seat when it comes to prioritizing sustainability to their employees  investors and their board   Going into 2015  it was clear BrandYourself needed to readdress its own profit margins or we would run out of money much sooner than we expected  At our worst we were burning over  300K mo  giving us less than 6 months to live  We wanted to hit profitability for two main reasons   To simply survive  To control our own fate  We didn t want to rely on a funding round that may never materialize  If we did decide to fundraise  we d be in a position of power  As the old adage says  the best time to raise money is when you don t need it    We wanted to do this without having to layoff any of our staff  which was a tall order  In a start up everybody is already overworked and understaffed so we knew simply telling employees  we had  50 at the time  they needed to do more with less would cause contention  If we wanted to change course without cannibalizing growth  we needed buy in from everybody   not just management   How did we do it   We explained why profitability was so important and made everybody part of the mission   While it may seem obvious to you as a founder   getting more profitable  doesn t always translate as a high priority for day to day employees  They don t see it as life or death  They re not looking at burn rates or run rates   it s not their job  They assume the company is safe  so added pressure to do more with less can seem self serving  Why should they  To put more money in the founders or investor pockets  while they work their tail off   Helping them understand the concepts of burn rates and run rates can help them understand that a startup s life is always on the line  I even highlighted cautionary tales of startups who vanished overnight  despite being popular brands  At first I was worried I d end up causing panic among employees  but it ended up being a motivating and empowering force  It helped everyone feel like part of the founding team with a unified mission  one that stretched beyond their daily job responsibilities  Everybody wanted to work together to make sure the company survived and thrived  unlike so many others  Here s an email I sent to Directors and Managers before an offsite retreat   Hi Everyone  Hope you re all as excited as I am for this weekend  Spending some time away from the office and thinking about the business from a perspective outside of your day to day is long overdue   I ll be sending out a deck later today that will set the agenda for our brainstorming this weekend  In the meantime I wanted to start framing your thinking now   The goal this weekend is to brainstorm and hone down on some important issues  from how we cut down churn to how we improve employee morale  We will be discussing how we can accomplish these while also becoming profitable and truly becoming masters of our destiny  I can not stress this point enough  Once we are in a position of profitability  which we are so close to hitting  we suddenly shift to a position of power  We can confidently set budgets for new sales initiatives  or new comp packages  or whatever we think is important  We can do so without the fear of becoming one of the many startups who fold over night  even companies that were great ideas with hundreds of people  these literally happen every single month   I recommend you check all of those links out   These articles are not meant to freak anyone out  they are meant to inspire your thinking  We are in the unique position   unlike any of the companies above   to survive  and thrive  without the need of a funding round that might not ever be there  When you re in that position  you can build real company culture and solve real problems  Here are a few other articles I think are important to read before the weekend  Let s be cockroaches this weekend  We chose a simple  company wide milestone and repeated it constantly   Once everybody was on board with hitting profitability  we wanted to create a simple metric that would encompass our goal and stretch across the company  We settled on  EBITDA ZERO    when our monthly expenses no longer exceeded our monthly revenue  We wrote it on the wall  We brought it up every single meeting  We incorporated it into our training materials  If you asked anyone internally what the company was focused on   from managers to trainees   they would say  EBITDA ZERO  without hesitation  It was so ingrained in the company that  after a day of interviewing  a potential employee emailed me to say  well it s clear everyone wants to be profitable    Apparently everyone he spoke to grilled him about his thoughts on capital efficiency  He was applying for office manager   Employees were encouraged to present new ideas based on the EBITDA ZERO framework   Like many startups  we try to promote a culture where anybody can come forward with a new idea  Ideas range from product features to new office snacks  Now  anytime an employee wanted to present an idea  they needed to estimate how much potential revenue vs how much expense it would add  On our offsite retreat we compiled all the ideas and calculated their effect on burn  If something added more expense than potential revenue  we all prioritized based off importance or looked to see if there was something less important to cut  This ended up accomplishing a few things for the company  It helped minimize the  scope creep  many companies get as they re growing  Employees often want to help improve the company but they don t know where to focus their ideas  Since the ideas end up ranging wildly in scope and purpose  managers get overwhelmed and end up ignoring all of them  This had the opposite effect  making everyone feel like a strategic part of the organization   It helped everyone think like a business owner  not just an employee  Not only were employees excited to come up with new ideas that would directly grow revenue  many went out of their way to find expenses they didn t think we needed   even from their own department  Imagine if every one of your employees was looking for places to cut  so they could make more room for revenue generating initiatives   It helped employees appreciate and empathize with other departments  Many commented that it helped them appreciate the challenges of growing a business they hadn t considered before  They recognized the push and pull between departments and developed cross departmental business skills that stretched outside their day to day   We Kept everybody up to date with the company financials   We presented our financials to the entire company every single month  We showed where revenue grew  where it stagnated  where expenses grew  where they fell  etc  We talked about what worked  what didn t  what needed to improve  This not only kept everyone focused and accountable  it became another strategic business goal we could share  regardless of departments  It helped people attach initiatives more clearly to business results   We Celebrated with everyone once we hit the goal  then set the next milestone   As I showed above  we ended up hitting EBITDA zero and reached profitability  It was a tremendous accomplishment for the business but it was even better celebrating with the whole team  Everyone had a sense of pride,"[364

398,training-dataset/business/101.txt,business,Growth vs  Profitability and Venture ReturnsThere has been a lot of good material written in the last few months about the impact of the topsy turvy fundraising market and the importance for entrepreneurs to shift their focus from growth to profitability  Some of the better posts over the last few months include Joseph Floyd s TechCrunch article and Bill Gurley s The Road to Recap   I agree with this sentiment to some extent  and have been preaching it with my entrepreneurs for many quarters as well  I fear  though  that the pendulum is at risk of swinging too far the other way  That is  entrepreneurs are not appreciating or understanding the true value of growth and thus taking the slow road to building a big company  Right now  it s fashionable to humblebrag about your startup that was a  15 year overnight success   The problem is that the slow road to success doesn t typically result in  venture returns   And the entire VC backed fundraising model is predicated on generating venture returns   So What Are  Venture Returns    In order for a venture capital fund to be considered a success  they need to deliver on one of two metrics  1  a cash on cash investment multiple of greater than 3 times invested capital  or 2  a net internal rate of return  IRR  of greater than 15   You can quibble around the edges  but these are basic truisms of our business that have held true for decades  The reason for these performance milestones are related to the fact that the money is tied up for many years  i e   is not liquid   and is considered riskier than many other types of investments  Thus  an illiquidity premium and a risk premium are required   For a portfolio of investments to achieve 3x invested capital  though  the winning investments must achieve something like 10x or better  In any portfolio  you will have mostly losers   investments where you lose all your money or perhaps get your money back after many years of hard work  But a few large winners of more than 10x your money will make the entire portfolio a success  Fred Wilson wrote an excellent retrospective on USV s first fund  Losing Money  where he cites the fact that they lost all their money in 40  of his portfolio companies in one of the best fund performing funds in the history of venture capital  Yet  they had five companies produce outcomes that were better than 20x  which drove their outstanding results   What Does It Take To Achieve Venture Returns   For a company to achieve a 10x or 20x or better return on invested capital  it needs to grow very  very fast  To bring this to life  take a look at the table below  It represents a profile of three startup company examples that start at  1 million in revenue at  year 1   note   to achieve its first in revenue often takes 2 3 years from inception   If you model out three different growth rates   100   50  and 25    for the subsequent six years  then the fast growing company has a shot at achieving venture returns  It will grow to  64 million in revenue and  assuming a 6x revenue multiple  reasonable assumption for a company growing that quickly at that scale   it would be worth nearly  400 million  Assuming the company required something like  20 30 million in capital over the life of its growth   perhaps accumulated across two to three rounds of financing   and assuming the position of early investors is a post money valuation of  40M  again  reasonable assumptions based on my experience   then a 10x outcome is achieved   Lastly  if the third company is growing at only 25  YoY  your firm will lose money a lot of money  These companies  because they re slow growers  maybe only be worth 2x invested capital and so worth  7 6M  only 20 cents in return on each invested dollar in capital Think about that for a minute   six years in a row of 100  growth  executed perfectly  and you get to 10x  But if you achieve  only  50  growth over six years  which is still outstanding performance by almost any other metric  and have a revenue multiple of 4x  lower than the 100  growing company for obvious reasons   you have a company worth only  45 million in value and investors basically get their money back   Now obviously this is a simplified example   growth rates change over time  often starting faster and slowing over time as markets mature and the base numbers you re trying to grow from get larger  But the point is pretty clear  there s a reason venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are so focused on growth  To generate venture returns  VCs need companies to consistently grow north of 100  year over year  And if a few companies in a portfolio don t achieve this  then no one generates venture returns  And if no one generates venture returns  the whole system breaks down   This example also uncovers a structural tension between the VC and the entrepreneur  VCs are naturally going to push entrepreneurs to grow faster in order to be that one portfolio company that achieves the 10x result that makes their fund a success  The entrepreneur is going to be more cautious to grow at the right pace  without burning too much capital or burning out customers or employees   So  yes  let s make sure we re building real companies that are generating real value  and over time  real profits  But let s not forget that to get there  our companies need to grow very  very fast over a consistent period of time  Remember that the next time someone tells you to slow things down,"[398 1378 1 752 943 711 182 545 111 762 114]"
415,training-dataset/business/665.txt,business,Unit EconomicsCommentators are looking hard for what s wrong with startups in Silicon Valley  First they talked about valuations being too high  Then they talked about valuations not really meaning anything  Then they talked about companies staying private too long  Then they talked about burn rates   But something does feel off  though it s been hard to precisely identify   I think the answer is unit economics  One of the jokes that came out of the 2000 bubble was  we lose a little money on every customer  but we make it up on volume   This was then out of fashion for a long time as Google and Facebook hit their stride   There are now more businesses than I ever remember before that struggle to explain how their unit economics are ever going to make sense  It usually requires an explanation on the order of infinite retention   yes  our sales and marketing costs are really high and our annual profit margins per user are thin  but we re going to keep the customer forever    a massive reduction in costs   we re going to replace all our human labor with robots    a claim that eventually the company can stop buying users   we acquire users for more than they re worth for now just to get the flywheel spinning    or something even less plausible   This is particularly common in startups that don t pass the Peter Thiel monopoly test these startups seem to have to spend every available dollar on user acquisition  and if they raise prices  customers defect to a similar service   Most great companies historically have had good unit economics soon after they began monetizing  even if the company as a whole lost money for a long period of time     Silicon Valley has always been willing to invest in money losing companies that may eventually make lots of money  That s great  I have never seen Silicon Valley so willing to invest in companies that have well understood financials showing they will probably always lose money  Low margin businesses have never been more fashionable here than they are right now   Companies that have raised lots of money are at particular risk  It s so tempting to paper over a problem with the business by spending more money instead of fixing the product or service   Burn rates by themselves are not scary  Burn rates are scary when you scale the business up and the model doesn t look any better  Burn rates are also scary when runway is short  i e   burning  2M a month with  100M in the bank is fine  burning  1M a month with  3M in the bank is really bad  even if the unit economics look great   The good news is that if you re aware of this you can avoid the trap  If there s no other way to operate in your space  maybe it s a bad business  The low margin  hyper competitive world is not the only place to be  Companies always have an explanation about how they re going to fix unit economics  so you really have to go out of your way not to delude yourself   If you hold yourself to the standard of making a product that is so good people spontaneously recommend it to their friends  and you have an easy to understand business model where you make more than you spend on each user  and it gets better not worse as you get bigger  you may not look like some of hottest companies of today  but you ll look a lot like Google and Facebook,"[415 432 111 1381 1 711 364 1075 1378 545 752]"
432,training-dataset/business/73.txt,business,How to Decrease the Odds That Your Startup Fails   Both Sides of the TableHow to Decrease the Odds That Your Startup Fails  Many startup businesses   tech or otherwise   fail  In our industry we applaud the efforts for entrepreneurs to have tried and we know that today s failure can bring the experience for tomorrow s success  We also know that even though many of us who are experienced in startup successes   failures look at businesses and say   That will never work   as many people said about Uber  or  You can t make any money in that business   as many said about WhatsApp or Dropbox  and of course some entrepreneurs pull off extraordinary things we never thought possible   Trying outrageous new things or even trying mundane things but in new ways but with extreme quality   innovation is what fuels the tech startup industry   Yet I can t help thinking there are many predictable failures that come from a lack of basic planning  It turns out that to build a successful company you ultimately need this strange thing called  revenue  that people don t just hand you  You need to earn it  And there s this other thing called  gross margin   which shows the quality of your revenue  It says that selling an airplane ticket for  500 and getting paid a  5 fees by the airlines  1  gross margin  is not the same thing as selling  500 of software that you built   90  gross margin    If you don t understand the basics of this I ve written this primer on Startup economics you might appreciate   mostly to get journalists to stop saying   That company isn t even profitable   when often that s a stupid comment  Lately I ve been having to say things I thought I d never have to remind people  like   getting to positive gross margin in several territories is a very low bar to claim success  or  profitable excluding marketing costs  is not actually a real thing   But today I want to give you advice on how to decrease your odds of failure in a startup  You may still fail but at least you ll have less chance of failing for the wrong reasons  Most of this advice boils down to an argument in favor of basic planning before starting a company or raising money  In many ways the fact that it has become so cheap to start a company and relatively cheap to raise angel seed money that we as an industry have gotten lazy on basic planning   The questions that a VC mulls before writing a check are precisely the questions you should be asking yourself   1  Market Size  It s ok to target a small market and you can probably build a niche business that is extremely valuable to you as an individual  But this isn t likely to be a VC backable business  which to be clear is totally ok   So if you go after a niche market then you need to raise small amounts of money  keep your costs exceedingly low  and get to cashflow positive as quickly as is possible  Running up big losses or trying to grow extraordinarily fast through paid marketing initiatives that have long payback periods will be the kiss of death for you  Marketing with long payback is precisely what requires venture capital   If your goal is to build a scalable startup then you need to focus on where large amounts of money are spent and or where large amounts of money will be spent  I like to use the example of a company I backed called MakeSpace because it s such an easy an obvious market to understand  MakeSpace provides physical storage  They pick up your stuff and drop it off at your house when you want it back  They photograph your stuff and provide a beautiful app where you can see what you have at any moment  So  let s start with the basics  The US market is worth more than  25 billion and Europe is the same  Asia is smaller but growing as wealth increases in large  urban environments   So when Sam Rosen came to me with the idea of disrupting storage with a product that is priced cheaper than existing incumbents and he could build a product that is a better service I was intrigued   There are a million ways to either research your industries market size and you re likely to have to do some basic estimations to figure out much of that is addressable to you  In our industry we call that a TAM  total addressable market  and I m sure you can even Google methods for calculating a TAM   Let me be very direct  If you re not even spending any time thinking about what your market could be you re simply being lazy and unprepared  For example  if you re going to build a travel planning website  as many  many startup entrepreneurs do  your basic research would be   How much do people spend on travel books   guides today   How much ad revenue does TripAdvisor make  And how much do others providers make   What is the CPM of ads in this industry  should I even be ad supported    How much money will airlines companies  hotel companies or event companies pay me as a referral or for booking   What would it take in investments to acquire and retain traffic to support these businesses   Answering these questions and other basic planning will tell you where the value is accrued in the enormous travel category  who is serving this market today and you can find whether your entry into the market is likely to create a big business  Many startups in stead launch  cool  products that their friends and peers love initially but don t yield large amounts of revenue or profits and certainly can t support the costs structure   Alternatively you may have figured out a way to capture a disproportionate amount of money in an under served part of the market  as Airbnb have  and build an enormous company  But not doing basic research makes no sense  Equally  hoping to unseat TripAdvisor without understand their SEO strengths and how much it would cost to knock them down would be na ve   2  Market Structure  Size of market matters but so  too  does  market structure   Are you going into an industry  say  music   dominated by a few very large incumbents who control much of the distribution or are you going into a market that is  fragmented  where nobody controls the industry  You can enter either but your strategy must be very different and I can tell you that fragmented markets are easier to disrupt   For all of the talk about Salesforce com controlling the CRM market I m told they still have less than 20  market share  In a way  CRM is actually fairly fragmented but to enter that market you d have to come up with a part of the value chain not dominated by Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics today   If you look at the structure of the travel industry above   of course we know that the hotel industry is fragmented while the airline industry is reasonable consolidated  So if you re going to build a front end booking structure for either it s probably more lucrative to do so for hotels vs  airlines  In the airline industry if 2 3 majors won t play ball with you then it s hard to build a valuable user experience  And to be successful you d have to figure out how to unseat the likes of Kayak with its existing brand and tech assets  No  thanks  Airbnb s success is that it unleashed a totally new market of inventory for travelers tired of paying too much for hotels and an entire supply of people who want to make a little extra money to make ends meet   If you look at the storage market I referenced above  the largest player   Public Storage   does about  2 4 billion in sales and thus controls less than 10  of the market  The top 5 players combined control less than 25  of the market  Storage is what s known as  highly fragmented   meaning easier for a new entrant to get traction if it could design a better product   service   experience   This is precisely why MakeSpace is growing so rapidly in its core markets  New York  Chicago and Washington DC where they can literally come and pick up your furniture and move it away and you never had to visit a facility and they do this at a cheaper price than incumbents by centralizing the location and thus having cheaper infrastructure costs  Sam did all this analysis before even deciding to build V1 of his software and before we put serious money behind him launching  He took seed money to test whether consumers cared and he started by not taking furniture to test the market with the least complexity   After a year in the market  MakeSpace was growing rapidly and our biggest issue was CAC  customer acquisition costs  relative to payback period  when we get our marketing investment back  and relative to LTV  lifetime value   The metrics were good but we wondered how much better they would be when we expanded our product  We first rolled out furniture in a newer market   Washington DC  and we increased ARPU  average revenue per month  per customer  by   300   we lowered our CAC  this is because the number of people who came to our site and converted went up  and thus we decreased our payback period   Boom  That is how great businesses are built  We did the planning work up front  We tested a simpler version of our product in the market first to prove product market fit before raising a ton of capital  we build software to handle the complexity of the  mundane things  like driver routing  logistics tracking  warehouse management  photo processing  etc and we expanded our offering to test whether we could convert at better rates with an expanded offering   And our software allowed us to offer  tighter pick up windows  better utilization of  uploader staff  and to launch new products   services that I won t discuss because they re in development now   If you create a business and start building products and go into an incubator or raise angel seed money and don t think about Market Size and Market Structure I only have one question  Why   3  Incumbent Strengths   Weaknesses  So by now you should know your industry s market size   structure  You should know at each part of the value chain where the value is controlled  But you also need to understand the incumbents  strengths and weaknesses and their likely responses to your successes   In an industry where you re reselling airplane tickets  for example  you need to think about the power they may or may not have over you  In the early days of every business the incumbents tend not to respond because you re too small and insignificant  As they see you grow the become intrigued and probably analyze your business model and potential  If you start to hit your success stride they will respond   As an investor that s precisely what goes through my mind  If you re not successful then who cares  But I m investing on the assumption you will be successful  of course  So if you are then I have to ask myself   What are the incumbents going to do when you grow    In the airline industry they have the ability to withhold inventory unless you re an 800 pound gorilla where they can t afford not to have your traffic while their competitors have it  But that s harder to build in 2016 than it was in say 2005  If you figure out how to scale a video product inside of Facebook really  really  quickly they re likely to allow it to happen for a while so they can study the positive   negative impacts on user experiences  But then they re likely going to  traffic shape  so that you re not too dominant  No platform is na ve enough to allow an outsider to grow enormously large in their ecosystem without an appropriate tax or benefit to them   The perfect competitors are the ones where they unable to respond due to The Innovator s Dilemma  Let me come back to MakeSpace to show you this point  Once we launched of course incumbents could try to create a product in which they pick up your stuff  At their scale this would be hard but doable  They could try to figure out how to do logistics  warehouse tracking  photo processing and route management  It would take 2 years to catch up but believe me they have the capital to do so  They might struggle to hire a players because  well  would you go work at Public Storage to build their software capabilities  Or would you go to a disruptor in stead   But assuming they were able to copy us  They literally can t respond to our core differentiator  They can t continually lower the costs of providing the storage because they re hamstrung by these huge assets called  local storage facilities  that were their great differentiator as they pushed to be closer and closer to the customers for  convenience  although I ve never heard that term from any storage customers   Our centralization is their achilles heel  It is Blockbuster video in the dawn of Netflix  And when you have a market where the competitor response can be that they throw money and resources at a problem but truly competing would be undermining their core business model and assets   BOOOOOM  Choose that market   4  Microeconomics  Smart investors think a lot about what we call  unit economics  or what is the economics of service one customers  We need to market to that customer to make them aware of our product or service  That marketing can be PR or SEO or influencer distribution or other forms of  unpaid  marketing  But in the end these all have a cost   it s just hidden  PR requires time and effort from your team that isn t spent elsewhere and thus is a real cost  SEO doesn t just happen   it requires a content strategy  inbound links  relevancy  keyword strategies  etc  And influencers may help once or twice but ultimately nothing is free   You may have paid marketing  SEM  Social Media Ads  Banner Ads  email lists  etc  Any way you slice it acquiring users and or customers isn t free  Then you need to understand the economic benefit to the user  It it just more time that they save  Efficiency  Will they save hard dollars  How much  Why  How will you charge  Will the user pay  Will a third party pay  advertisers  data companies   If a third party ad  what CPMs do they pay today  what minimum volume of traffic will you need  will you sell direct or through an ad broker  Will you have premium ads or remnant ads   Then you need to understand what these people are paying for similar products and services today  You can t just make this up  If you want to do food delivery you need to know if the consumer pays or the restaurant pays and why  You need to understand what alternatives they have and how that will shape the amount of money they ll spend  If you want to sell a  coffee in a box  subscription   is it premium to their buying Starbucks or Nespresso or cheaper  Will they supplement those purchases or replace it   In any market you re competing with one thing that all people must compete with   share of wallet   which in most markets is not unlimited  unless you re selling extreme luxury goods    If you re selling to moms   what are they spending for comparable products today  What will they not spending on if they re ramping up on your products   What price will your customer ultimately accept  This is based on  price elasticity  and you can google that to understand it better  Essentially products that are  inelastic  means price increases don t affect demand much  think cigarettes  drugs  alcohol  and if they re  elastic  it means small price increases can massively drop demand but equally large price decreases can massively increase demand   What are the customer s alternatives  In economics this is known as a  substitute product   If you launch a fizzy water product you may think your competitors are Badoit and San Pelligrino but a substitute product might be flat water like Propel or cold green tea  Most products have substitutes and it s worth knowing   Our portfolio company Ring had a new  security doorbell  which is truly a new market  But there are competitors  high end alarm systems like from ADT  and there are substitutes  like trying to use a less sophisticated product like DropCam  which is great as a camera but doesn t have any of the security features built in and isn t constructed to work well outside your house and in a secure way  That s why Ring is amongst the fastest growing company in our portfolio  But to assume there are no substitutes would be wrong   Of course the hardest competitor for most of us is simply customer inertia   Competition  If you want to succeed you need to study the competitors  You won t likely launch into a market with nobody else present  You need to ask yourself honestly how your product or service is going to be significantly better in some way than the competition that exists in the market  You need a wedge  You may be cheaper  you may have more features  you may be easier to use  you may target one under served demographic  think Bevel by Walker   Co  or you may just be better at sales   marketing than the competition with an equivalent  or even inferior  product  But not to study what else is happening in a market is wrong   Why would you consider the competitors in a market AFTER you ve spent 18 months building product on somebody else s money and with a team you ve pried away from their existing jobs  You only have your limited time on this Earth and to find out some competitor disadvantage after years of work is crazy to me  But it is often what happens with first time entrepreneurs who are spoiled for choice with angel investors willing to fund with little thought or with the plethora of incubators that now exists who need a steady flow of options to hope to have the next big winner so they may not ask all the tough questions  But you should  Why wouldn t you   History  Finally  Study your history  If you want to launch a company that competes with RottenTomatoes you need to study both why they are successful and what happened to the 20 other companies that tried to knock them off their stools  Do you think nobody has tried to better IMDB  I ve seen 10 tries  Want to eradicate Evite  Why have so many before you failed  TripAdvisor  Yeah  we all know it s imperfect  But it s a fierce competitor that killed many a company before it   Every market is littered with companies that came before you  That doesn t mean you won t succeed  But not to ask yourself the questions of  what went wrong there  and  what could we learn from it  is to give up your biggest advantage  the ability to stand on the shoulders of those who came before you   Conclusion  Plan  Think  Study  Test  Validate data  Validate firmly held positions  Know your planned sources of differentiation and adjust as you learn  Read plenty of  what went wrong  eulogies by founders and see what you can learn  But also understand that the lens from which they tell you the answer is both imperfect and has a narrative bias  The right answer might be  as I read recently    we should have hired more people and raised more money  more quickly and either succeeded quickly or found out we were wrong quickly and moved on to the next company   But it might also be   We chose the wrong market  we didn t understand the value drivers  we didn t do enough planning and we did what we thought was cool but the market didn t validate

and investment bankers regularly will expedite the process and help avoid glitches and delays in your SEC review  Speed matters  Execution is critical   2  Underwriters  Identify prospective investment bankers and leading analysts in your market space  Consider the appropriate number and mix of managing underwriting firms and which ones can  get the deal sold  if market conditions turn against you   3  Audited Financial Statements  Make sure your audited financial statements are close to final  You will only need two full years of audited financial statements in your SEC filings if you qualify as an  emerging growth company   but most companies are still electing to include three years  If you have switched auditors during that period  consult with both firms  as your current firm may need to re audit prior years   4  Other Financial Statements  Consider when your quarterly interim financial statements will become available and understand the impact this will have on the timing of your SEC filings  Make sure you are in a position to assemble up to three years of  selected  financial data  unless you have been in business for a shorter period   If you have undertaken acquisitions or other significant transactions  understand what additional financial statements may be required in your filing  including pro forma financial statements and separate audited financial statements related to the acquired businesses   5  Accounting Issues  Identify any sensitive issues in your significant accounting policies  Discuss these with your audit team and make sure they discuss them with their  national office   The SEC s  hot issues  are constantly evolving  often unpredictably and without formal notice  Current issues include  segment  reporting and the new revenue recognition standards   6  Key Metrics  Public investors will be looking for the operating metrics  beyond the GAAP financials  that management uses to measure and run the business  Investment bankers are very helpful  but a company should have its own perspective on the metrics that will work best over time   7  Cheap Stock  One SEC hot issue that won t change is the  cheap stock  analysis whether sufficient charges have been taken in the past for stock options and other equity grants  This issue has become more critical as the IRS has announced it will be targeting companies with cheap stock charges disclosed in their SEC filings for Section 409A enforcement  Work closely with your auditors and counsel to analyze this issue   8  Stock Valuations  If you haven t already done so  engage an independent valuation expert to perform regular stock valuations to help you price option grants going forward  Many pre IPO companies perform valuations on a quarterly basis  if not more often  depending on their option granting schedule   9  Which Stock Exchange   Understand the benefits of the alternative stock exchanges NYSE  Nasdaq  NYSE AMEX or even AIM in London  Analyze the listing standards of your preferred market to ensure you will qualify to list there   10  Board and Committees  Reassess the composition of your board of directors and board committees to identify any changes necessary to satisfy exchange listing and SEC requirements  Beyond the legal requirements  seek out directors with the background to help you run and grow a public company  Understand the requirements for independent directors and the transition rules that will apply after your IPO  Recruiting capable directors can take time  so start early   11  Corporate Governance  Begin to act like a public company  Focus on corporate governance appropriate for a public company and develop a culture of compliance  Work with counsel to adopt state of the art corporate policies and codes of conduct   12  Management Team  Build out your senior management team  as necessary  to operate as a public company  Also consider key hires in areas such as financial reporting and investor relations   13  Executive Compensation  Consider engaging a compensation consultant to assist in analyzing compensation practices  including equity and non equity incentives  Begin to develop a compensation structure appropriate for a public company  including a process for Board compensation   14  Internal Financial Controls  Discuss with your advisors any  material weaknesses  or  significant deficiencies  in your internal financial controls and understand their impact on your SEC review  Be prepared to discuss these forthrightly with your underwriters and to disclose them publicly   15  SOX Compliance  Understand the transition period over which you will need to become compliant with the internal controls testing required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act  Consider engaging an accounting consultancy firm now to assist with compliance   16  Auditors  Ensure that your audit firm is properly  independent  from your company under PCAOB and SEC rules  Don t hire employees of your audit firm without first understanding whether that will compromise the firm s independence  Understand what relationships there may be between your auditors and your officers and directors  including whether the firm has provided any tax services to your officers   17  Public Communications  Discuss with counsel the rules that will govern your public communications during the IPO process  Standardize public communications to establish a track record  and develop consistent processes for external communications  including review of press releases by outside counsel  Beware of media interviews and public appearances in which a potential IPO is discussed   18  Corporate Website  Perform a review of your company s website to ensure that the information on the website is accurate and current  Work with counsel to make sure that the website is consistent with SEC positions on acceptable public communications prior to an IPO and permissible website content   19  Corporate Documents  Understand the provisions of your current charter  bylaws and other corporate documents as they relate to an IPO  Who has registration rights  Are any special approvals required from stockholders or third parties  Will your preferred stock automatically convert  Are all stockholders and optionholders required to sign 180 day  lock up  agreements with your underwriters  Make sure that your capitalization records accurately reflect all stock issuances  transfers and cancellations  as well as option and warrant issuances  exercises and cancellations   20  Due Diligence  The underwriters in an IPO and their counsel will conduct extensive due diligence on your company  including a thorough review of its minute books  capitalization records  material agreements  etc  Anticipate what materials the underwriters and their counsel will want to review  and begin organizing these documents to expedite the due diligence process  Failure to do so could result in avoidable delays to your offering  Consider engaging an online datasite firm for the delivery of due diligence materials  and get materials posted early  If you haven t yet analyzed your historic option grants to ensure they have complied with Rule 701 of the Securities Act then you definitely need new legal counsel   21  Legal Disputes  Analyze any pending or threatened legal disputes and assess whether any of these disputes could potentially derail the IPO  Also consider the impact that filing for an IPO may have on your negotiating position in these disputes  Litigants will often be less likely to settle for a reasonable amount if they know the company is in the IPO process  If you are thinking of initiating a dispute with another party  consider its effect on the IPO   22  Confidential Treatment  SEC rules will require you to publicly file material commercial agreements  Determine which agreements will likely be required to be filed and review these agreements for confidentiality provisions that will need to be waived by the counterparty  Also  determine which terms  if any  of these agreements  would be competitively harmful if disclosed  Discuss with your counsel the process of seeking confidential treatment from the SEC for these provisions   23  Director   Officer Liability Insurance  The exposure to liability is significantly greater for directors and officers of public companies than it is for private companies  A private company D O insurance policy will not be appropriate once the company is public  Choose an experienced D O insurance broker and coordinate with the broker early in the process to ensure that your officers and directors are adequately protected   24  Personal Financial Planning for Executives  Senior management should consult with personal financial advisors regarding wealth maximization alternatives  Bear in mind that any loans from the company to executives or directors must be repaid before your first filing with the SEC   25  Perhaps Most Important   Do You Really Want to Be Public   Carefully consider the implications of becoming a public company and the alternatives  Are you ready for the management distraction that will be involved in the IPO process  Are you prepared for the potential liabilities  the requirement for transparency and full disclosure  and the short term focus that will be adopted by the analysts who follow your stock  Is your financial team ready to produce quarterly financial statements in the required time frame  Do you have adequate visibility into your future financial results and do you have a financial model that promotes predictability  Are your insiders ready to relinquish control and answer to new public stockholders,"[446 848 526 68 31 1238 1 545 33 842 1381]"

Equity Statistics Report  In it  we analyzed a significant subset of the 5 000  cap tables on our system   We identified 4 big insights in our research   Average dilution by stage is highly predictable Founders often own far less at exit than they might think Star performers and average performers have wildly different experiences Later rounds don t always translate to increased returns for founders  We ll explore these insights in the post below  If you want to see get the full report with a broader set of insights download it here   But first  an analogy from the world of artificial intelligence   How Learning from Equity Benchmarks Can Inform Your Decisions  I recently read Pedro Domingos  great book on machine learning  The Master Algorithm  In it  Pedro describes what may be one of the most efficient learning algorithms ever   Let s say you are trying to write some code to identify digital pictures containing a dog  It turns out it is nearly impossible to write a decision tree program that can accurately identify a dog  Every rule you could imagine  four legs  elongated snout  tail  has an exception or is shared by another animal   Often the best coders are lazy  So they figured out a lazy approach to solving the problem  They identified the most similar pictures in their database and compared the target picture with them   If the most similar pictures contained a dog  then they assumed that the target picture must also contain a dog  This became what is called the k nearest neighbors algorithm for learning by analogy   So what does this story about machine learning have to do with cap tables and startups   Our goal in putting together the Capshare Private Company Equity Statistics Report was to provide statistical data to help startup executives find analogies  patterns  and similarities in related startups   With this data and future data we will release  you should start to identify the nearest companies to your own and learn by analogy   Insight  1  Average Dilution By Stage Is Highly Predictable  Few would argue that creating equity value is one of the most important reasons for starting a company  By definition  founders start out with 100  ownership  But it only goes down from there  This concept is called equity dilution   Companies often care about the effects of dilution on different groups  all shareholders  all employees  as opposed to investors   and founders  How quickly equity dilution occurs and by how much is the biggest determinant of the ultimate equity value of a typical shareholder  including founders    Fred Wilson  the famous venture capitalist  said in a 2009 article that founder dilution   is a subject near and dear to entrepreneurs  maybe the dearest subject of them all    In the same article  Fred lays out the following averages   Founders who  go all the way  through the process of building a lasting and sustainable profitable business  as opposed to an early exit  will generally suffer the most dilution  In my experience  it will generally take three to four rounds of equity capital to finance the business and 20 25  of the company to recruit and retain a management team  That will typically leave the founder founder team with 10 20  of the business when it s all said and done  The equity split at 20  for the founders will typically be  20 25  for the management team  20  for the founders  and 55 60  for the investors  angel all the way to late stage VC    Fred and others have pointed out significant limitations with these rules of thumb  The biggest limitation is that founder dilution changes dramatically based on the stage of a company at exit   Some companies may sell at the Series Seed stage and others may exit after a Series F  Another way to say this is that it isn t clear what it will take to  go all the way    Based on our analysis  Fred s estimates were really accurate from companies at or beyond the Series D stage  But we also collected data for all of the earlier stages   To gather the data  we made a simplifying assumption  We assumed that founders owned 100  of common stock and restricted stock on the cap tables we analyzed  Based on this  we found the following dilution curve   We also looked at total non preferred ownership  This would include founder and non founder equity  If you subtract these numbers from 100   you will get a great estimate of all investor ownership   So if your company exits around Series D  you can expect the following splits   Founder ownership  11 17   Other employees  17 21   Investors  66 68   Those numbers are really consistent with Fred s estimates   Founders and employees can end up owning a lot more but only if they sell before the Series D   It turns out that we can fit a line almost perfectly to these graphs   Based on this data  we identified what we call the Employee Ownership Formula   Y    0 378   ln X    1  where Y is the fully diluted employee   founder ownership on the cap table  and  X is the number of series of fundraising rounds your company has  You can use this formula to predict the average total employee ownership of any startup or benchmark your own  So if you have raised two rounds  your employee ownership should be around 73    Insight  2  Founders Often Own Far Less At Exit Than They Might Think  A lot of founders start out thinking that they will own 40  50  of their company when they sell  In reality  they will likely own far less   Part of this reality is rooted in the fact startups take a long time to exit  The NVCA created a weighted average exit analysis that weights the number of IPOs and M A exits for typical venture backed companies  The graph below charts the weighted average time to exit for startups that exited in each year   The average as of 2014 was approximately 7 years  and the trendline suggests that exit timeframes are getting longer   If we assume a typical company raises 4 5 rounds over that timeframe  employees  including founders  would own 40 47 6    Using assumptions from the previous section about splits between founders and other employees  founders should expect to own 16 21  of their company at exit   So if there are 3 founders  an individual founder may only own 5 7  of the company at exit  That s quite a bit less than most expect   Insight  3  Star Performers and Average Performers Have Wildly Different Experiences  In the graphs above  the mean and median numbers don t always line up  Typically the mean employee ownership is higher than the median ownership at later stages   This indicates that there are some outlier companies where the employees own more than most of the other companies  This raises the mean  or average  up   The distribution graph below shows this effect dramatically  We found a group of  typical  or  median  companies and a group of  outlier  or  star  companies   For example  when we looked at valuation data at any stage  we found distributions that looked like this   This implies that while most companies have moderate valuations  there is a very long tail of companies with significantly higher valuations   The difference in pre money valuations between the  standard  and  star groups  at Series D is an astounding  144M  The gap begins at the Series Seed and persists at all stages   This data confirms a commonly held belief   a relatively small percentage of companies command the highest valuations  Most companies receive significantly lower valuations than the top performers   Receiving a billion dollar valuation is an extremely rare event for a start up   it s why they re called  unicorns  after all   These top performing companies have a much stronger waterfall outlook for employees   Waterfall analysis  is the calculation of the payouts to all security classes and shareholders from zero to infinity taking into account the following factors  Liquidation preferences  Participation rights and caps  Conversion rights  Cumulative dividends  PIK dividends  Options and warrants Based on this analysis  you can calculate payouts to all shareholders at any hypothetical exit value for the company   To get this waterfall data  we calculated the average payout per employee if the company sold for its most recent post money valuation   Median per employee waterfall values hover around  130  190K  Mean per employee waterfall values are about 2 5x that value   Remember  per employee figures include founder amounts  So non founder employee numbers could be significantly smaller  A fair assumption is that non founder employees values would be roughly 50  of the figures above   What does this mean in practice  If you are a mid level employee at a relatively unknown  but somewhat successful  startup  your equity is probably worth  65 95K if the company exits at its latest valuation   By contrast  if you are a mid level employee at a company like AirBnb  your equity could be worth somewhere around  130K  500K   Insight  4  Later Rounds Don t Always Translate to Increased Returns for Founders  A former Harvard Business School professor recently released research into the effect of founder control on startup valuations   He found that valuations of founder controlled companies are 17    44  lower than non founder controlled companies   This would seem to indicate that giving up control is a key to creating more value   This could be simple correlation rather than causation   Our research shows that founders generally can t retain control of their company beyond the Series A round  The graph below shows founders typically own only 45  of a Series A company   If it is simple correlation  it is fairly obvious why non founder controlled companies are worth less  They simply haven t been able to raise a round past Series A   Regardless  founders should care more about their personal returns than the overall valuation of the company   Valuation is just one of three key factors that influences personal returns for founders  The other two being ownership percentage and liquidation preferences   Our research shows that founder returns are really high if you are in a star company but quite a bit lower than what you might expect if you are in a  median  company   In our analysis  the founders  stock  as a group  was worth only  6 52M at a  median  as opposed to  52 45M at the mean company   If you have 2 3 founders  the per founder returns could be much smaller  In other words  at Series D  stages  the founders are filthy rich at  star  companies but only just cracking the million dollar mark in the more typical startup   Also  notice the growth in value for the mean line versus the median line  This implies that raising additional rounds of funding is probably a no brainer if you are in the  star  group  The economic rewards are enormous   Along with many well documented positives  raising venture capital brings several potential negatives including   Increased liquidation preferences  Increased pressure to grow  Focus on growth over profitability  increased risk   Giving up control  Cultural changes  We ve discussed this further in our articles on Saas myths and term sheets   If your company is more of a  median  company  it often makes economic sense to keep raising venture capital  but not always  The economic rewards of raising more and more venture capital are muted   Our research indicates you should make sure that the extra  500K  1M in waterfall value you get is worth what you give up   We hope you enjoyed our top 4 key insights from

a great pitch deck   That s the question many founders ask when they re about to raise capital for their startups  The best approach for creating a compelling pitch deck for a startup has been discussed by many VCs and successful founders over the years  and naturally there are plenty of opinions  ranging from what you should include in your presentation to which slide goes where   Here  we ll focus on proven ways to make your startup deck memorable   These strategies and ideas used by successful companies can help you create a pitch that will leave investors itching to become part of your business  Let s get to it   BONUS  We ve launched the Mobile Midas Touch  A list of the world s top mobile investors  Download it for free now to see who s who in the mobile market   Customize Your Pitch To The Investors  Like a nice suit  the best startup pitches are tailored   To make sure your pitch is cut just right  spend time researching your audience  In doing so  you ll gain better insight into potential investors  motives and the kinds of businesses they re looking for  Reid Hoffman  co founder of LinkedIn  once gave this exact advice to founders looking to raise capital in a blog post where he breaks down the deck he used to raise LinkedIn s series B    Research prospective investors thoroughly  What kinds of businesses are they looking at  What model criteria triggers do they use to judge whether a project will be successful or not    Some investors value the technology more than the team  some investors are just looking for clear indications that your idea is going to work  Thankfully  in today s climate  it s easier than ever to gauge what investors want based on their tweets  LinkedIn profiles  websites and blogs   Start Strong  The beginning of your presentation can make or break you  Within the first few minutes   maybe even seconds   potential investors begin to determine whether you re someone they want to invest in or do business with long term   Before you develop a memorable pitch  you need to understand the oldest and lowest part of the brain  the limbic cortex  or what many professionals call the  lizard brain    crocodile brain  or  dinosaur brain   It s the part of the brain that helps us determine immediately whether something is dangerous or relevant  and how we should react to something new  It s our first line of defence and controls our fight or flight response   The croc brain is concerned with two things  Is it dangerous  and is it novel   Anything dangerous   an idea that feels high risk  counter to the investor s thoughts  desperate or nervous   and the croc brain responds with rejection  If your pitch isn t new or novel  the croc brain signals to the rest of the brain that it knows this information and can ignore it   If your pitch is not able to make it past an investor s croc brain  the presentation will likely fall flat  So how do you make it through the croc brain   Showcase The Problem And The Solution  Take a look at these three slides from the first Airbnb deck   The first slide breaks through the dino brain by sharing a novel idea   Book rooms with locals  rather than hotels   Paul Graham  founder of YCombinator  once wrote   Before they  investors  can judge whether you ve built a good x  they have to understand what kind of x you ve built  They will get very frustrated if instead of telling them what you do  you make them sit through some kind of preamble   That s why you make it clear what you do in the very first slide   When Airbnb launched in 2008  the concept of the sharing economy was still very new  Their idea was risky  but through compelling storytelling and a clear value proposition  they captured the attention of investors within a few short slides   When pitching  the Airbnb team immediately addressed some of the concerns that an investor could have with their business model  The second slide explains why someone would book with Airbnb and not their biggest competitor  the hotel industry  and reveals the gap in the market  The third slide communicates thehow behind their product and in simple language highlights the benefits for both parties involved in a transaction   The transition from problem to solution is a staple in startup decks  It allows you to quickly highlight the pain points you re solving for your customers and to address the concerns of potential investors  But problem solution is also a format that investors see over and over  so it s important to tell your story in a way that will quickly get your audience on board   Share Facts   Graphs That Demonstrate Traction  The slides above are from the pitch decks of Buffer and MixPanel  two marketing software companies that have raised millions of dollars and become industry icons   These two slides show the importance of highlighting progress  Investors want to know that you can execute toward a plan and that you re moving in the right direction  Ideally  they want to see exponential growth in your key metrics  For some startups  this might be the amount of time customers spend in the app  for others  it s the number of paying users  Identify the metrics you feel are most important to your business and show your investors how you re moving the needle   Paint A Clear   Promising Picture Of The Future  LinkedIn s Reid Hoffman once described the importance of showing the future to investors   In order to believe that LinkedIn was a good investment  our investors would need to believe that there was a broad trend of moving from directories to networks  1 0 to 2 0   that networks could become hugely valuable  and that a LinkedIn people search application on a network would be a valuable asset   It s your job to paint a picture that s bigger than what you have today  Show investors what the future will look like because of their investment  The most effective way to project the future is to communicate insights or stats about existing trends  Highlight information from industry reports that isn t common knowledge  or reveal an insight you learned while building your product   Sell the future   after all  the future is what investors are really buying into   Conclusion  Raising capital isn t as easy as the constant stream of TechCrunch headlines might make it sound  It takes a lot of late nights  pitch revisions  email followups and rejections   The above tips will vastly improve your pitch  but the best way to create a quality deck is to ensure you have a quality product  Build something that people want  and remember that a demo does more than a PowerPoint  We ve assisted plenty of startups looking to launch MVPs  arming them with the prototypes and resources they need to pitch their ideas   If you re

526,training-dataset/business/509.txt,business,Recommendations for Startup Employee Option Plans   Andreessen HorowitzThis post presents our current recommendation for how tech startups should structure employee stock incentive programs   I recently wrote a post about the potential issues associated with switching from a 90 day post employment exercise period to a 10 year exercise period for employee stock option grants  While the goal of that post was to surface a number of considerations founders should take into account if contemplating such a switch  many people interpreted the post as a statement against 10 year exercise periods  This was not our intention  so I want to be clear about our overall position as a firm   While everyone wants to do what s best for the lifeblood of the company   the former  current  and potentially future employees   the 90 day exercise essentially pits cash rich employees against cash poor ones  And that isn t right  Employees who have vested their hard earned options should not have to forfeit their stock simply because they don t have the financial resources to exercise their options and pay the resulting taxes   So  we propose an option program here that includes 10 year exercise periods  and we encourage founders to consider a comprehensive program that aims to address the following issues that may then result from that   Inadvertently incentivizing employees to quit   If an employee has been at your company for  say  2 years and has the opportunity to join a new company  she has an interesting financial decision to make  If she stays at the company and it fails  she loses everything  If she leaves and your company succeeds  her upside is protected by the 10 year option to exercise 2 years of options plus she protects her downside by acquiring stock in a new company  Even if she likes your company much better  she still has a fiduciary responsibility to her family to do what s best for them  and in many cases the rational thing will be to create diversification and thus go to the new company   Potentially creating legal risks for ex employees   Since companies are staying private longer  ex employees who want liquidity may turn to the private secondary market to sell their stock or pledge their options to a third party  It s long settled under federal securities laws that the seller can be liable to the buyer if he knows information that could affect the value of the stock and that information is not disclosed to the buyer  For example  if he knows  as a result of having been at the company  that the prospects of the business are looking grim or a product launch is significantly delayed  that s important information a buyer would deserve to know in evaluating whether to buy the stock  and failure to disclose that information creates real legal jeopardy for the seller  Although we haven t yet seen the SEC challenge many secondary sales to date  Mary Jo White  the Chairwoman of the SEC  recently gave a talk at Stanford where she hinted that the SEC is going to take a closer look at secondary stock sales  This risk exists in a 90 day exercise program as well  but it becomes a lot more acute when you move to 10 year exercise periods  Mitigating it is a good idea regardless of which exercise period you choose   and it s not only good for your employees  but will also help protect the company from potential legal problems   Making critical shareholder votes more difficult   When you need to make changes that require approval of the common shareholders  you will now have many more shareholders to track down  Shareholder votes can impact critically important situations such as acquisition offers  new share authorizations  to issue options to employees    buying companies  and raising money  If you have to round up thousands of shareholders to take corporate actions  your job as CEO becomes much more difficult  Slowing down these kinds of transactions may put the transactions and potentially your company at risk   Inferior tax treatment for employees due to the difference between the two types of options that companies can grant employees  Incentive Stock Options  ISOs  and Non Qualified Stock Options  non quals    ISOs have better tax treatment for employees because the employee does not have to pay taxes at the time of exercise on the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair market value of the stock  But under current law  if an employer moves to a 10 year exercise program  ISOs become  disqualified  and automatically convert into non quals if not exercised within 90 days of employment  Thus  the employee will receive the less favorable tax treatment under the longer exercise period   Here is a stock option plan that we believe offers the fairer 10 year exercise period  while also mitigating the consequences of the above issues   10 year option exercise period  This enables employees who do not have the money to purchase their options and pay the corresponding taxes at the time of their exit to get the full benefit of their vested options  As noted above  however  under current law  this would mean that all options would be non quals  not ISOs    Back end loaded stock vesting  By using a back end loaded vesting schedule  you greatly mitigate incentives to quit  There are many ways to do this  but one example is what Snapchat does  employees vest 10  in the first year  20  in the second year  30  in the third year  and 40  in the fourth year  In lieu of a back end loaded vesting schedule  companies may also consider minimum tenure requirements for the 10 year exercise window to kick in or a sliding scale where time to exercise increases with employee tenure   Transfer restrictions  Strong stock transfer restrictions will protect the company  its employees  and its ex employees from any potential hazards associated with secondary selling  Among other things  transfer restrictions force the company to be an active party in any secondary selling issues and thus more likely ensure that all proper disclosures are made to potential buyers  relieving legal liability on employees and controlling who ends up owning the company s private stock  Particularly with the SEC s new focus in this area  companies should think this issue through very carefully  To be perfectly clear on this  these same transfer restrictions should equally apply to founders and all investors  these risks are not employee specific  but are simply magnified if you have lots more ex employees with vested shares   83 b  for early employees  There is a simple  existing  employee favorable mechanism that requires no changes to option plans  at least for early stage companies  It s called 83 b   aptly named for the IRS Code section that describes the provision  An 83 b  election allows an employee to early exercise her options even before they have vested  The employee comes out of pocket for the cost of the exercise price  why this solution works for early stage companies only  where the common stock valuation is very low  but does not owe any taxes  this is because the exercise price and the fair market value of the stock are equal   An 83 b  election also confers another tax benefit  it starts the clock ticking on the long term capital gains holding period  so when the employee sells the stock  she is likely taxed at the lower capital gains rate only  Granted  this doesn t solve the problem for all employees  because as the exercise price of the stock goes up  later hired employees would have to be able to afford much higher amounts of cash to do an 83 b  election  But we encourage the use of the 83 b  mechanism for early employees   Moving to RSUs as valuations materially increase  Restricted Stock Units  RSUs   unlike options  don t have an exercise price  Thus  there is no out of pocket cost for the employee to get the benefit of the RSU and there is no risk of RSUs being  out of the money    RSUs always have value equal to the price of the stock regardless of when they were granted to employees  RSUs thus not only help solve the 10 year exercise problem  as long as they are structured properly  there are no taxes at the time of vesting   but they also sidestep other issues such as stock price fluctuations that could cause options to go underwater and be worthless  However  because the math of options says you typically issue about 1 3rd the number of RSUs as stock options to employees  it s best to wait until the intrinsic value of the RSU is high enough that such a tradeoff makes sense for employees  There s no magic number here  but in general as companies get to  1  billion valuations and the issues with options become more intense  switching to RSUs makes sense  Unlike options  RSUs generally can t be sold prior to an IPO  so they don t offer an interim liquidity solution for employees  but  given the heightened legal risks associated with secondary selling generally  this is still a reasonable trade off in the current environment   Closing considerations  The decision to adopt a 10 year exercise program  as with all aspects of a compensation strategy  is highly company specific  each company should go through its own idea maze for what plan best suits its overall culture and goals  Compensation is a foundational philosophy and a core part of a company s culture   no different from other aspects of culture that companies seek to foster   and should be well thought out and consistent with the objectives and culture of the overall organization   Furthermore  the decision also depends on the type of company you re building and therefore the types of skill sets for which you are optimizing  For example  as a hardware company where long term knowledge about infrastructure matters  Tesla may value longer tenure than other companies and thus might design a program around this specific goal   So  there is no one size fits all approach   And whatever plan you choose  it is likely to morph over time as the environment changes  For example  there is a proposed bill in Congress right now  the Warner Heller Bill  that would solve one half of the current option problem   by deferring for up to 7 years the taxes owed by a private company employee at the time of option exercise  While this bill is in the early stages of making its way through Congress  the point is that this situation is highly fluid so make sure your plans can accommodate any such policy changes   The broader liquidity environment will play a role as well in how long the exercise period should be  We are here because companies are choosing to stay private significantly longer than the time period for which the 4 year option vesting program was originally designed  So  this current recommendation works in an environment where time to IPO is about 10 years  To the extent this time period shrinks  founders may want to move to a shorter period more closely tied to the average time to liquidity   Most importantly  no matter what plan you implement  be completely transparent with employees   at the time of hiring   about all of the issues surrounding your compensation program  Among the feedback I received on the earlier post  I was struck by how many employees felt the 90 day option expiration window was never mentioned to them when they joined the company and thus was a complete surprise when they first learned about it at exit  If hiring managers are failing to be clear and transparent with employees about any aspect of compensation  this is an enormous mistake that fundamentally compromises trust between employer and employee   The existing plans  while flawed  have been around for many decades  so the issues are well known  New plans will surely generate new issues  so design your plan carefully and to be consistent with the goals and company culture you want to foster   Thanks to Adam D

545,training-dataset/business/409.txt,business,How to Fund a Startup        Want to start a startup  Get funded by Y Combinator   November 2005    Venture funding works like gears  A typical startup goes through several rounds of funding  and at each round you want to take just enough money to reach the speed where you can shift into the next gear     Few startups get it quite right  Many are underfunded  A few are overfunded  which is like trying to start driving in third gear     I think it would help founders to understand funding better not just the mechanics of it  but what investors are thinking  I was surprised recently when I realized that all the worst problems we faced in our startup were due not to competitors  but investors  Dealing with competitors was easy by comparison     I don t mean to suggest that our investors were nothing but a drag on us  They were helpful in negotiating deals  for example  I mean more that conflicts with investors are particularly nasty  Competitors punch you in the jaw  but investors have you by the balls     Apparently our situation was not unusual  And if trouble with investors is one of the biggest threats to a startup  managing them is one of the most important skills founders need to learn     Let s start by talking about the five sources of startup funding  Then we ll trace the life of a hypothetical  very fortunate  startup as it shifts gears through successive rounds     Friends and Family    A lot of startups get their first funding from friends and family  Excite did  for example  after the founders graduated from college  they borrowed  15 000 from their parents to start a company  With the help of some part time jobs they made it last 18 months     If your friends or family happen to be rich  the line blurs between them and angel investors  At Viaweb we got our first  10 000 of seed money from our friend Julian  but he was sufficiently rich that it s hard to say whether he should be classified as a friend or angel  He was also a lawyer  which was great  because it meant we didn t have to pay legal bills out of that initial small sum     The advantage of raising money from friends and family is that they re easy to find  You already know them  There are three main disadvantages  you mix together your business and personal life  they will probably not be as well connected as angels or venture firms  and they may not be accredited investors  which could complicate your life later     The SEC defines an  accredited investor  as someone with over a million dollars in liquid assets or an income of over  200 000 a year  The regulatory burden is much lower if a company s shareholders are all accredited investors  Once you take money from the general public you re more restricted in what you can do    1      A startup s life will be more complicated  legally  if any of the investors aren t accredited  In an IPO  it might not merely add expense  but change the outcome  A lawyer I asked about it said  When the company goes public  the SEC will carefully study all prior issuances of stock by the company and demand that it take immediate action to cure any past violations of securities laws  Those remedial actions can delay  stall or even kill the IPO  Of course the odds of any given startup doing an IPO are small  But not as small as they might seem  A lot of startups that end up going public didn t seem likely to at first   Who could have guessed that the company Wozniak and Jobs started in their spare time selling plans for microcomputers would yield one of the biggest IPOs of the decade   Much of the value of a startup consists of that tiny probability multiplied by the huge outcome     It wasn t because they weren t accredited investors that I didn t ask my parents for seed money  though  When we were starting Viaweb  I didn t know about the concept of an accredited investor  and didn t stop to think about the value of investors  connections  The reason I didn t take money from my parents was that I didn t want them to lose it     Consulting    Another way to fund a startup is to get a job  The best sort of job is a consulting project in which you can build whatever software you wanted to sell as a startup  Then you can gradually transform yourself from a consulting company into a product company  and have your clients pay your development expenses     This is a good plan for someone with kids  because it takes most of the risk out of starting a startup  There never has to be a time when you have no revenues  Risk and reward are usually proportionate  however  you should expect a plan that cuts the risk of starting a startup also to cut the average return  In this case  you trade decreased financial risk for increased risk that your company won t succeed as a startup     But isn t the consulting company itself a startup  No  not generally  A company has to be more than small and newly founded to be a startup  There are millions of small businesses in America  but only a few thousand are startups  To be a startup  a company has to be a product business  not a service business  By which I mean not that it has to make something physical  but that it has to have one thing it sells to many people  rather than doing custom work for individual clients  Custom work doesn t scale  To be a startup you need to be the band that sells a million copies of a song  not the band that makes money by playing at individual weddings and bar mitzvahs     The trouble with consulting is that clients have an awkward habit of calling you on the phone  Most startups operate close to the margin of failure  and the distraction of having to deal with clients could be enough to put you over the edge  Especially if you have competitors who get to work full time on just being a startup     So you have to be very disciplined if you take the consulting route  You have to work actively to prevent your company growing into a  weed tree   dependent on this source of easy but low margin money    2      Indeed  the biggest danger of consulting may be that it gives you an excuse for failure  In a startup  as in grad school  a lot of what ends up driving you are the expectations of your family and friends  Once you start a startup and tell everyone that s what you re doing  you re now on a path labelled  get rich or bust   You now have to get rich  or you ve failed     Fear of failure is an extraordinarily powerful force  Usually it prevents people from starting things  but once you publish some definite ambition  it switches directions and starts working in your favor  I think it s a pretty clever piece of jiujitsu to set this irresistible force against the slightly less immovable object of becoming rich  You won t have it driving you if your stated ambition is merely to start a consulting company that you will one day morph into a startup     An advantage of consulting  as a way to develop a product  is that you know you re making something at least one customer wants  But if you have what it takes to start a startup you should have sufficient vision not to need this crutch     Angel Investors    Angels are individual rich people  The word was first used for backers of Broadway plays  but now applies to individual investors generally  Angels who ve made money in technology are preferable  for two reasons  they understand your situation  and they re a source of contacts and advice     The contacts and advice can be more important than the money  When del icio us took money from investors  they took money from  among others  Tim O Reilly  The amount he put in was small compared to the VCs who led the round  but Tim is a smart and influential guy and it s good to have him on your side     You can do whatever you want with money from consulting or friends and family  With angels we re now talking about venture funding proper  so it s time to introduce the concept of exit strategy  Younger would be founders are often surprised that investors expect them either to sell the company or go public  The reason is that investors need to get their capital back  They ll only consider companies that have an exit strategy meaning companies that could get bought or go public     This is not as selfish as it sounds  There are few large  private technology companies  Those that don t fail all seem to get bought or go public  The reason is that employees are investors too of their time and they want just as much to be able to cash out  If your competitors offer employees stock options that might make them rich  while you make it clear you plan to stay private  your competitors will get the best people  So the principle of an  exit  is not just something forced on startups by investors  but part of what it means to be a startup     Another concept we need to introduce now is valuation  When someone buys shares in a company  that implicitly establishes a value for it  If someone pays  20 000 for 10  of a company  the company is in theory worth  200 000  I say  in theory  because in early stage investing  valuations are voodoo  As a company gets more established  its valuation gets closer to an actual market value  But in a newly founded startup  the valuation number is just an artifact of the respective contributions of everyone involved     Startups often  pay  investors who will help the company in some way by letting them invest at low valuations  If I had a startup and Steve Jobs wanted to invest in it  I d give him the stock for  10  just to be able to brag that he was an investor  Unfortunately  it s impractical  if not illegal  to adjust the valuation of the company up and down for each investor  Startups  valuations are supposed to rise over time  So if you re going to sell cheap stock to eminent angels  do it early  when it s natural for the company to have a low valuation     Some angel investors join together in syndicates  Any city where people start startups will have one or more of them  In Boston the biggest is the Common Angels  In the Bay Area it s the Band of Angels  You can find groups near you through the Angel Capital Association    3   However  most angel investors don t belong to these groups  In fact  the more prominent the angel  the less likely they are to belong to a group     Some angel groups charge you money to pitch your idea to them  Needless to say  you should never do this     One of the dangers of taking investment from individual angels  rather than through an angel group or investment firm  is that they have less reputation to protect  A big name VC firm will not screw you too outrageously  because other founders would avoid them if word got out  With individual angels you don t have this protection  as we found to our dismay in our own startup  In many startups  lives there comes a point when you re at the investors  mercy when you re out of money and the only place to get more is your existing investors  When we got into such a scrape  our investors took advantage of it in a way that a name brand VC probably wouldn t have     Angels have a corresponding advantage  however  they re also not bound by all the rules that VC firms are  And so they can  for example  allow founders to cash out partially in a funding round  by selling some of their stock directly to the investors  I think this will become more common  the average founder is eager to do it  and selling  say  half a million dollars worth of stock will not  as VCs fear  cause most founders to be any less committed to the business     The same angels who tried to screw us also let us do this  and so on balance I m grateful rather than angry   As in families  relations between founders and investors can be complicated      The best way to find angel investors is through personal introductions  You could try to cold call angel groups near you  but angels  like VCs  will pay more attention to deals recommended by someone they respect     Deal terms with angels vary a lot  There are no generally accepted standards  Sometimes angels  deal terms are as fearsome as VCs   Other angels  particularly in the earliest stages  will invest based on a two page agreement     Angels who only invest occasionally may not themselves know what terms they want  They just want to invest in this startup  What kind of anti dilution protection do they want  Hell if they know  In these situations  the deal terms tend to be random  the angel asks his lawyer to create a vanilla agreement  and the terms end up being whatever the lawyer considers vanilla  Which in practice usually means  whatever existing agreement he finds lying around his firm   Few legal documents are created from scratch      These heaps o  boilerplate are a problem for small startups  because they tend to grow into the union of all preceding documents  I know of one startup that got from an angel investor what amounted to a five hundred pound handshake  after deciding to invest  the angel presented them with a 70 page agreement  The startup didn t have enough money to pay a lawyer even to read it  let alone negotiate the terms  so the deal fell through     One solution to this problem would be to have the startup s lawyer produce the agreement  instead of the angel s  Some angels might balk at this  but others would probably welcome it     Inexperienced angels often get cold feet when the time comes to write that big check  In our startup  one of the two angels in the initial round took months to pay us  and only did after repeated nagging from our lawyer  who was also  fortunately  his lawyer     It s obvious why investors delay  Investing in startups is risky  When a company is only two months old  every day you wait gives you 1 7  more data about their trajectory  But the investor is already being compensated for that risk in the low price of the stock  so it is unfair to delay     Fair or not  investors do it if you let them  Even VCs do it  And funding delays are a big distraction for founders  who ought to be working on their company  not worrying about investors  What s a startup to do  With both investors and acquirers  the only leverage you have is competition  If an investor knows you have other investors lined up  he ll be a lot more eager to close   and not just because he ll worry about losing the deal  but because if other investors are interested  you must be worth investing in  It s the same with acquisitions  No one wants to buy you till someone else wants to buy you  and then everyone wants to buy you     The key to closing deals is never to stop pursuing alternatives  When an investor says he wants to invest in you  or an acquirer says they want to buy you  don t believe it till you get the check  Your natural tendency when an investor says yes will be to relax and go back to writing code  Alas  you can t  you have to keep looking for more investors  if only to get this one to act    4      Seed Funding Firms    Seed firms are like angels in that they invest relatively small amounts at early stages  but like VCs in that they re companies that do it as a business  rather than individuals making occasional investments on the side     Till now  nearly all seed firms have been so called  incubators   so Y Combinator gets called one too  though the only thing we have in common is that we invest in the earliest phase     According to the National Association of Business Incubators  there are about 800 incubators in the US  This is an astounding number  because I know the founders of a lot of startups  and I can t think of one that began in an incubator     What is an incubator  I m not sure myself  The defining quality seems to be that you work in their space  That s where the name  incubator  comes from  They seem to vary a great deal in other respects  At one extreme is the sort of pork barrel project where a town gets money from the state government to renovate a vacant building as a  high tech incubator   as if it were merely lack of the right sort of office space that had till now prevented the town from becoming a startup hub  At the other extreme are places like Idealab  which generates ideas for new startups internally and hires people to work for them     The classic Bubble incubators  most of which now seem to be dead  were like VC firms except that they took a much bigger role in the startups they funded  In addition to working in their space  you were supposed to use their office staff  lawyers  accountants  and so on     Whereas incubators tend  or tended  to exert more control than VCs  Y Combinator exerts less  And we think it s better if startups operate out of their own premises  however crappy  than the offices of their investors  So it s annoying that we keep getting called an  incubator   but perhaps inevitable  because there s only one of us so far and no word yet for what we are  If we have to be called something  the obvious name would be  excubator    The name is more excusable if one considers it as meaning that we enable people to escape cubicles      Because seed firms are companies rather than individual people  reaching them is easier than reaching angels  Just go to their web site and send them an email  The importance of personal introductions varies  but is less than with angels or VCs     The fact that seed firms are companies also means the investment process is more standardized   This is generally true with angel groups too   Seed firms will probably have set deal terms they use for every startup they fund  The fact that the deal terms are standard doesn t mean they re favorable to you  but if other startups have signed the same agreements and things went well for them  it s a sign the terms are reasonable     Seed firms differ from angels and VCs in that they invest exclusively in the earliest phases often when the company is still just an idea  Angels and even VC firms occasionally do this  but they also invest at later stages     The problems are different in the early stages  For example  in the first couple months a startup may completely redefine their idea  So seed investors usually care less about the idea than the people  This is true of all venture funding  but especially so in the seed stage     Like VCs  one of the advantages of seed firms is the advice they offer  But because seed firms operate in an earlier phase  they need to offer different kinds of advice  For example  a seed firm should be able to give advice about how to approach VCs  which VCs obviously don t need to do  whereas VCs should be able to give advice about how to hire an  executive team   which is not an issue in the seed stage     In the earliest phases  a lot of the problems are technical  so seed firms should be able to help with technical as well as business problems     Seed firms and angel investors generally want to invest in the initial phases of a startup  then hand them off to VC firms for the next round  Occasionally startups go from seed funding direct to acquisition  however  and I expect this to become increasingly common     Google has been aggressively pursuing this route  and now Yahoo is too  Both now compete directly with VCs  And this is a smart move  Why wait for further funding rounds to jack up a startup s price  When a startup reaches the point where VCs have enough information to invest in it  the acquirer should have enough information to buy it  More information  in fact  with their technical depth  the acquirers should be better at picking winners than VCs     Venture Capital Funds    VC firms are like seed firms in that they re actual companies  but they invest other people s money  and much larger amounts of it  VC investments average several million dollars  So they tend to come later in the life of a startup  are harder to get  and come with tougher terms     The word  venture capitalist  is sometimes used loosely for any venture investor  but there is a sharp difference between VCs and other investors  VC firms are organized as funds  much like hedge funds or mutual funds  The fund managers  who are called  general partners   get about 2  of the fund annually as a management fee  plus about 20  of the fund s gains     There is a very sharp dropoff in performance among VC firms  because in the VC business both success and failure are self perpetuating  When an investment scores spectacularly  as Google did for Kleiner and Sequoia  it generates a lot of good publicity for the VCs  And many founders prefer to take money from successful VC firms  because of the legitimacy it confers  Hence a vicious  for the losers  cycle  VC firms that have been doing badly will only get the deals the bigger fish have rejected  causing them to continue to do badly     As a result  of the thousand or so VC funds in the US now  only about 50 are likely to make money  and it is very hard for a new fund to break into this group     In a sense  the lower tier VC firms are a bargain for founders  They may not be quite as smart or as well connected as the big name firms  but they are much hungrier for deals  This means you should be able to get better terms from them     Better how  The most obvious is valuation  they ll take less of your company  But as well as money  there s power  I think founders will increasingly be able to stay on as CEO  and on terms that will make it fairly hard to fire them later     The most dramatic change  I predict  is that VCs will allow founders to cash out partially by selling some of their stock direct to the VC firm  VCs have traditionally resisted letting founders get anything before the ultimate  liquidity event   But they re also desperate for deals  And since I know from my own experience that the rule against buying stock from founders is a stupid one  this is a natural place for things to give as venture funding becomes more and more a seller s market     The disadvantage of taking money from less known firms is that people will assume  correctly or not  that you were turned down by the more exalted ones  But  like where you went to college  the name of your VC stops mattering once you have some performance to measure  So the more confident you are  the less you need a brand name VC  We funded Viaweb entirely with angel money  it never occurred to us that the backing of a well known VC firm would make us seem more impressive    5      Another danger of less known firms is that  like angels  they have less reputation to protect  I suspect it s the lower tier firms that are responsible for most of the tricks that have given VCs such a bad reputation among hackers  They are doubly hosed  the general partners themselves are less able  and yet they have harder problems to solve  because the top VCs skim off all the best deals  leaving the lower tier firms exactly the startups that are likely to blow up     For example  lower tier firms are much more likely to pretend to want to do a deal with you just to lock you up while they decide if they really want to  One experienced CFO said  The better ones usually will not give a term sheet unless they really want to do a deal  The second or third tier firms have a much higher break rate it could be as high as 50   It s obvious why  the lower tier firms  biggest fear  when chance throws them a bone  is that one of the big dogs will notice and take it away  The big dogs don t have to worry about that     Falling victim to this trick could really hurt you  As one VC told me  If you were talking to four VCs  told three of them that you accepted a term sheet  and then have to call them back to tell them you were just kidding  you are absolutely damaged goods  Here s a partial solution  when a VC offers you a term sheet  ask how many of their last 10 term sheets turned into deals  This will at least force them to lie outright if they want to mislead you     Not all the people who work at VC firms are partners  Most firms also have a handful of junior employees called something like associates or analysts  If you get a call from a VC firm  go to their web site and check whether the person you talked to is a partner  Odds are it will be a junior person  they scour the web looking for startups their bosses could invest in  The junior people will tend to seem very positive about your company  They re not pretending  they want to believe you re a hot prospect  because it would be a huge coup for them if their firm invested in a company they discovered  Don t be misled by this optimism  It s the partners who decide  and they view things with a colder eye     Because VCs invest large amounts  the money comes with more restrictions  Most only come into effect if the company gets into trouble  For example  VCs generally write it into the deal that in any sale  they get their investment back first  So if the company gets sold at a low price  the founders could get nothing  Some VCs now require that in any sale they get 4x their investment back before the common stock holders  that is  you  get anything  but this is an abuse that should be resisted     Another difference with large investments is that the founders are usually required to accept  vesting  to surrender their stock and earn it back over the next 4 5 years  VCs don t want to invest millions in a company the founders could just walk away from  Financially  vesting has little effect  but in some situations it could mean founders will have less power  If VCs got de facto control of the company and fired one of the founders  he d lose any unvested stock unless there was specific protection against this  So vesting would in that situation force founders to toe the line     The most noticeable change when a startup takes serious funding is that the founders will no longer have complete control  Ten years ago VCs used to insist that founders step down as CEO and hand the job over to a business guy they supplied  This is less the rule now  partly because the disasters of the Bubble showed that generic business guys don t make such great CEOs     But while founders will increasingly be able to stay on as CEO  they ll have to cede some power  because the board of directors will become more powerful  In the seed stage  the board is generally a formality  if you want to talk to the other board members  you just yell into the next room  This stops with VC scale money  In a typical VC funding deal  the board of directors might be composed of two VCs  two founders  and one outside person acceptable to both  The board will have ultimate power  which means the founders now have to convince instead of commanding     This is not as bad as it sounds  however  Bill Gates is in the same position  he doesn t have majority control of Microsoft  in principle he also has to convince instead of commanding  And yet he seems pretty commanding  doesn t he  As long as things are going smoothly  boards don t interfere much  The danger comes when there s a bump in the road  as happened to Steve Jobs at Apple     Like angels  VCs prefer to invest in deals that come to them through people they know  So while nearly all VC funds have some address you can send your business plan to  VCs privately admit the chance of getting funding by this route is near zero  One recently told me that he did not know a single startup that got funded this way     I suspect VCs accept business plans  over the transom  more as a way to keep tabs on industry trends than as a source of deals  In fact  I would strongly advise against mailing your business plan randomly to VCs  because they treat this as evidence of laziness  Do the extra work of getting personal introductions  As one VC put it  I m not hard to find  I know a lot of people  If you can t find some way to reach me  how are you going to create a successful company  One of the most difficult problems for startup founders is deciding when to approach VCs  You really only get one chance  because they rely heavily on first impressions  And you can t approach some and save others for later  because  a  they ask who else you ve talked to and when and  b  they talk among themselves  If you re talking to one VC and he finds out that you were rejected by another several months ago  you ll definitely seem shopworn     So when do you approach VCs  When you can convince them  If the founders have impressive resumes and the idea isn t hard to understand  you could approach VCs quite early  Whereas if the founders are unknown and the idea is very novel  you might have to launch the thing and show that users loved it before VCs would be convinced     If several VCs are interested in you  they will sometimes be willing to split the deal between them  They re more likely to do this if they re close in the VC pecking order  Such deals may be a net win for founders  because you get multiple VCs interested in your success  and you can ask each for advice about the other  One founder I know wrote  Two firm deals are great  It costs you a little more equity  but being able to play the two firms off each other  as well as ask one if the other is being out of line  is invaluable  When you do negotiate with VCs  remember that they ve done this a lot more than you have  They ve invested in dozens of startups  whereas this is probably the first you ve founded  But don t let them or the situation intimidate you  The average founder is smarter than the average VC  So just do what you d do in any complex  unfamiliar situation  proceed deliberately  and question anything that seems odd     It is  unfortunately  common for VCs to put terms in an agreement whose consequences surprise founders later  and also common for VCs to defend things they do by saying that they re standard in the industry  Standard  schmandard  the whole industry is only a few decades old  and rapidly evolving  The concept of  standard  is a useful one when you re operating on a small scale  Y Combinator uses identical terms for every deal because for tiny seed stage investments it s not worth the overhead of negotiating individual deals   but it doesn t apply at the VC level  On that scale  every negotiation is unique     Most successful startups get money from more than one of the preceding five sources    6   And  confusingly  the names of funding sources also tend to be used as the names of different rounds  The best way to explain how it all works is to follow the case of a hypothetical startup     Stage 1  Seed Round    Our startup begins when a group of three friends have an idea   either an idea for something they might build  or simply the idea  let s start a company   Presumably they already have some source of food and shelter  But if you have food and shelter  you probably also have something you re supposed to be working on  either classwork  or a job  So if you want to work full time on a startup  your money situation will probably change too     A lot of startup founders say they started the company without any idea of what they planned to do  This is actually less common than it seems  many have to claim they thought of the idea after quitting because otherwise their former employer would own it     The three friends decide to take the leap  Since most startups are in competitive businesses  you not only want to work full time on them  but more than full time  So some or all of the friends quit their jobs or leave school   Some of the founders in a startup can stay in grad school  but at least one has to make the company his full time job      They re going to run the company out of one of their apartments at first  and since they don t have any users they don t have to pay much for infrastructure  Their main expenses are setting up the company  which costs a couple thousand dollars in legal work and registration fees  and the living expenses of the founders     The phrase  seed investment  covers a broad range  To some VC firms it means  500 000  but to most startups it means several months  living expenses  We ll suppose our group of friends start with  15 000 from their friend s rich uncle  who they give 5  of the company in return  There s only common stock at this stage  They leave 20  as an options pool for later employees  but they set things up so that they can issue this stock to themselves if they get bought early and most is still unissued   and the three founders each get 25      By living really cheaply they think they can make the remaining money last five months  When you have five months  runway left  how soon do you need to start looking for your next round  Answer  immediately  It takes time to find investors  and time  always more than you expect  for the deal to close even after they say yes  So if our group of founders know what they re doing they ll start sniffing around for angel investors right away  But of course their main job is to build version 1 of their software     The friends might have liked to have more money in this first phase  but being slightly underfunded teaches them an important lesson  For a startup  cheapness is power  The lower your costs  the more options you have not just at this stage  but at every point till you re profitable  When you have a high  burn rate   you re always under time pressure  which means  a  you don t have time for your ideas to evolve  and  b  you re often forced to take deals you don t like     Every startup s rule should be  spend little  and work fast     After ten weeks  work the three friends have built a prototype that gives one a taste of what their product will do  It s not what they originally set out to do in the process of writing it  they had some new ideas  And it only does a fraction of what the finished product will do  but that fraction includes stuff that no one else has done before     They ve also written at least a skeleton business plan  addressing the five fundamental questions  what they re going to do  why users need it  how large the market is  how they ll make money  and who the competitors are and why this company is going to beat them   That last has to be more specific than  they suck  or  we ll work really hard       If you have to choose between spending time on the demo or the business plan  spend most on the demo  Software is not only more convincing  but a better way to explore ideas     Stage 2  Angel Round    While writing the prototype  the group has been traversing their network of friends in search of angel investors  They find some just as the prototype is demoable  When they demo it  one of the angels is willing to invest  Now the group is looking for more money  they want enough to last for a year  and maybe to hire a couple friends  So they re going to raise  200 000     The angel agrees to invest at a pre money valuation of  1 million  The company issues  200 000 worth of new shares to the angel  if there were 1000 shares before the deal  this means 200 additional shares  The angel now owns 200 1200 shares  or a sixth of the company  and all the previous shareholders  percentage ownership is diluted by a sixth  After the deal  the capitalization table looks like this  shareholder shares percent                                 angel 200 16 7 uncle 50 4 2 each founder 250 20 8 option pool 200 16 7            total 1200 100 To keep things simple  I had the angel do a straight cash for stock deal  In reality the angel might be more likely to make the investment in the form of a convertible loan  A convertible loan is a loan that can be converted into stock later  it works out the same as a stock purchase in the end  but gives the angel more protection against being squashed by VCs in future rounds     Who pays the legal bills for this deal  The startup  remember  only has a couple thousand left  In practice this turns out to be a sticky problem that usually gets solved in some improvised way  Maybe the startup can find lawyers who will do it cheaply in the hope of future work if the startup succeeds  Maybe someone has a lawyer friend  Maybe the angel pays for his lawyer to represent both sides   Make sure if you take the latter route that the lawyer is representing you rather than merely advising you  or his only duty is to the investor      An angel investing  200k would probably expect a seat on the board of directors  He might also want preferred stock  meaning a special class of stock that has some additional rights over the common stock everyone else has  Typically these rights include vetoes over major strategic decisions  protection against being diluted in future rounds  and the right to get one s investment back first if the company is sold     Some investors might expect the founders to accept vesting for a sum this size  and others wouldn t  VCs are more likely to require vesting than angels  At Viaweb we managed to raise  2 5 million from angels without ever accepting vesting  largely because we were so inexperienced that we were appalled at the idea  In practice this turned out to be good  because it made us harder to push around     Our experience was unusual  vesting is the norm for amounts that size  Y Combinator doesn t require vesting  because  a  we invest such small amounts  and  b  we think it s unnecessary  and that the hope of getting rich is enough motivation to keep founders at work  But maybe if we were investing millions we would think differently     I should add that vesting is also a way for founders to protect themselves against one another  It solves the problem of what to do if one of the founders quits  So some founders impose it on themselves when they start the company     The angel deal takes two weeks to close  so we are now three months into the life of the company     The point after you get the first big chunk of angel money will usually be the happiest phase in a startup s life  It s a lot like being a postdoc  you have no immediate financial worries  and few responsibilities  You get to work on juicy kinds of work  like designing software  You don t have to spend time on bureaucratic stuff  because you haven t hired any bureaucrats yet  Enjoy it while it lasts  and get as much done as you can  because you will never again be so productive     With an apparently inexhaustible sum of money sitting safely in the bank  the founders happily set to work turning their prototype into something they can release  They hire one of their friends at first just as a consultant  so they can try him out and then a month later as employee  1  They pay him the smallest salary he can live on  plus 3  of the company in restricted stock  vesting over four years   So after this the option pool is down to 13 7      7   They also spend a little money on a freelance graphic designer     How much stock do you give early employees  That varies so much that there s no conventional number  If you get someone really good  really early  it might be wise to give him as much stock as the founders  The one universal rule is that the amount of stock an employee gets decreases polynomially with the age of the company  In other words  you get rich as a power of how early you were  So if some friends want you to come work for their startup  don t wait several months before deciding     A month later  at the end of month four  our group of founders have something they can launch  Gradually through word of mouth they start to get users  Seeing the system in use by real users people they don t know gives them lots of new ideas  Also they find they now worry obsessively about the status of their server   How relaxing founders  lives must have been when startups wrote VisiCalc      By the end of month six  the system is starting to have a solid core of features  and a small but devoted following  People start to write about it  and the founders are starting to feel like experts in their field     We ll assume that their startup is one that could put millions more to use  Perhaps they need to spend a lot on marketing  or build some kind of expensive infrastructure  or hire highly paid salesmen  So they decide to start talking to VCs  They get introductions to VCs from various sources  their angel investor connects them with a couple  they meet a few at conferences  a couple VCs call them after reading about them     Step 3  Series A Round    Armed with their now somewhat fleshed out business plan and able to demo a real  working system  the founders visit the VCs they have introductions to  They find the VCs intimidating and inscrutable  They all ask the same question  who else have you pitched to   VCs are like high school girls  they re acutely aware of their position in the VC pecking order  and their interest in a company is a function of the interest other VCs show in it      One of the VC firms says they want to invest and offers the founders a term sheet  A term sheet is a summary of what the deal terms will be when and if they do a deal  lawyers will fill in the details later  By accepting the term sheet  the startup agrees to turn away other VCs for some set amount of time while this firm does the  due diligence  required for the deal  Due diligence is the corporate equivalent of a background check  the purpose is to uncover any hidden bombs that might sink the company later  like serious design flaws in the product  pending lawsuits against the company  intellectual property issues  and so on  VCs  legal and financial due diligence is pretty thorough  but the technical due diligence is generally a joke    8      The due diligence discloses no ticking bombs  and six weeks later they go ahead with the deal  Here are the terms  a  2 million investment at a pre money valuation of  4 million  meaning that after the deal closes the VCs will own a third of the company  2    4   2    The VCs also insist that prior to the deal the option pool be enlarged by an additional hundred shares  So the total number of new shares issued is 750  and the cap table becomes  shareholder shares percent                                 VCs 650 33 3 angel 200 10 3 uncle 50 2 6 each founder 250 12 8 employee 36  1 8  unvested option pool 264 13 5            total 1950 100 This picture is unrealistic in several respects  For example  while the percentages might end up looking like this  it s unlikely that the VCs would keep the existing numbers of shares  In fact  every bit of the startup s paperwork would probably be replaced  as if the company were being founded anew  Also  the money might come in several tranches  the later ones subject to various conditions though this is apparently more common in deals with lower tier VCs  whose lot in life is to fund more dubious startups  than with the top firms     And of course any VCs reading this are probably rolling on the floor laughing at how my hypothetical VCs let the angel keep his 10 3 of the company  I admit  this is the Bambi version  in simplifying the picture  I ve also made everyone nicer  In the real world  VCs regard angels the way a jealous husband feels about his wife s previous boyfriends  To them the company didn t exist before they invested in it    9      I don t want to give the impression you have to do an angel round before going to VCs  In this example I stretched things out to show multiple sources of funding in action  Some startups could go directly from seed funding to a VC round  several of the companies we ve funded have     The founders are required to vest their shares over four years  and the board is now reconstituted to consist of two VCs  two founders  and a fifth person acceptable to both  The angel investor cheerfully surrenders his board seat     At this point there is nothing new our startup can teach us about funding or at least  nothing good    10   The startup will almost certainly hire more people at this point  those millions must be put to work  after all  The company may do additional funding rounds  presumably at higher valuations  They may if they are extraordinarily fortunate do an IPO  which we should remember is also in principle a round of funding  regardless of its de facto purpose  But that  if not beyond the bounds of possibility  is beyond the scope of this article     Deals Fall Through    Anyone who s been through a startup will find the preceding portrait to be missing something  disasters  If there s one thing all startups have in common  it s that something is always going wrong  And nowhere more than in matters of funding     For example  our hypothetical startup never spent more than half of one round before securing the next  That s more ideal than typical  Many startups even successful ones come close to running out of money at some point  Terrible things happen to startups when they run out of money  because they re designed for growth  not adversity     But the most unrealistic thing about the series of deals I ve described is that they all closed  In the startup world  closing is not what deals do  What deals do is fall through  If you re starting a startup you would do well to remember that  Birds fly  fish swim  deals fall through     Why  Partly the reason deals seem to fall through so often is that you lie to yourself  You want the deal to close  so you start to believe it will  But even correcting for this  startup deals fall through alarmingly often far more often than  say  deals to buy real estate  The reason is that it s such a risky environment  People about to fund or acquire a startup are prone to wicked cases of buyer s remorse  They don t really grasp the risk they re taking till the deal s about to close  And then they panic  And not just inexperienced angel investors  but big companies too     So if you re a startup founder wondering why some angel investor isn t returning your phone calls  you can at least take comfort in the thought that the same thing is happening to other deals a hundred times the size     The example of a startup s history that I ve presented is like a skeleton accurate so far as it goes  but needing to be fleshed out to be a complete picture  To get a complete picture  just add in every possible disaster     A frightening prospect  In a way  And yet also in a way encouraging  The very uncertainty of startups frightens away almost everyone  People overvalue stability especially young people  who ironically need it least  And so in starting a startup  as in any really bold undertaking  merely deciding to do it gets you halfway there  On the day of the race  most of the other runners won t show up         Notes      1   The aim of such regulations is to protect widows and orphans from crooked investment schemes  people with a million dollars in liquid assets are assumed to be able to protect themselves  The unintended consequence is that the investments that generate the highest returns  like hedge funds  are available only to the rich       2   Consulting is where product companies go to die  IBM is the most famous example  So starting as a consulting company is like starting out in the grave and trying to work your way up into the world of the living       3   If  near you  doesn t mean the Bay Area  Boston  or Seattle  consider moving  It s not a coincidence you haven t heard of many startups from Philadelphia       4   Investors are often compared to sheep  And they are like sheep  but that s a rational response to their situation  Sheep act the way they do for a reason  If all the other sheep head for a certain field  it s probably good grazing  And when a wolf appears  is he going to eat a sheep in the middle of the flock  or one near the edge       5   This was partly confidence  and partly simple ignorance  We didn t know ourselves which VC firms were the impressive ones  We thought software was all that mattered  But that turned out to be the right direction to be naive in  it s much better to overestimate than underestimate the importance of making a good product       6   I ve omitted one source  government grants  I don t think these are even worth thinking about for the average startup  Governments may mean well when they set up grant programs to encourage startups  but what they give with one hand they take away with the other  the process of applying is inevitably so arduous  and the restrictions on what you can do with the money so burdensome  that it would be easier to take a job to get the money     You should be especially suspicious of grants whose purpose is some kind of social engineering   e g  to encourage more startups to be started in Mississippi  Free money to start a startup in a place where few succeed is hardly free     Some government agencies run venture funding groups  which make investments rather than giving grants  For example  the CIA runs a venture fund called In Q Tel that is modelled on private sector funds and apparently generates good returns  They would probably be worth approaching if you don t mind taking money from the CIA       7   Options have largely been replaced with restricted stock  which amounts to the same thing  Instead of earning the right to buy stock  the employee gets the stock up front  and earns the right not to have to give it back  The shares set aside for this purpose are still called the  option pool        8   First rate technical people do not generally hire themselves out to do due diligence for VCs  So the most difficult part for startup founders is often responding politely to the inane questions of the  expert  they send to look you over       9   VCs regularly wipe out angels by issuing arbitrary amounts of new stock  They seem to have a standard piece of casuistry for this situation  that the angels are no longer working to help the company  and so don t deserve to keep their stock  This of course reflects a willful misunderstanding of what investment means  like any investor  the angel is being compensated for risks he took earlier  By a similar logic  one could argue that the VCs should be deprived of their shares when the company goes public       10   One new thing the company might encounter is a down round  or a funding round at valuation lower than the previous round  Down rounds are bad news  it is generally the common stock holders who take the hit  Some of the most fearsome provisions in VC deal terms have to do with down rounds like  full ratchet anti dilution   which is as frightening as it sounds     Founders are tempted to ignore these clauses  because they think the company will either be a big success or a complete bust  VCs know otherwise  it s not uncommon for startups to have moments of adversity before they ultimately succeed  So it s worth negotiating anti dilution provisions  even though you don t think you need to  and VCs will try to make you feel that you re being gratuitously troublesome     Thanks to Sam Altman  Hutch Fishman  Steve Huffman  Jessica Livingston  Sesha Pratap  Stan Reiss

621,training-dataset/business/1494.txt,business,5 Reasons Why Traction is Overrated for Seed Stage  Enterprise  Startups5 Reasons Why Traction is Overrated for Seed Stage  Enterprise  Startups  A large part of my day is spent meeting with companies that will likely never be a fit for our fund or my investment profile  There isn t anything wrong with these companies  they often go on to raise money from other funds or angel investors   but they just aren t a fit for me  Often it s because the company is in a space that I m not pursuing  but without fail  nearly every founder asks  well  what metrics do I have to hit for you to write a check   In some very rare cases  the businesses are indeed too early and a few additional proof points will go a long way in reinforcing my conviction  But for the most part  there isn t a MRR milestone that will flip the switch for your Seed round  Why  Because traction really doesn t matter for a Seed stage company   Now before my VC brethren crucify me for heresy  let me explain  I primarily invest in Seed stage enterprise companies  Simply put  enterprise is different from consumer  For a Seed stage consumer company you could and should have thousands of customers  For enterprise  that number is generally significantly smaller  generally single digits  With a sample size that small  customer validation can be incredibly deceiving  Some of the main issues I see with early customer traction include   1  Selling to Friends and or Previous Customers  Revenue from warm customers may look great for your financials and for references  but unfortunately friendly sales don t scale  These customers can be an incredibly helpful advantage  especially in high ACV  high friction verticals like fintech or healthcare   but ultimately companies need to demonstrate a scalable acquisition model OUTSIDE of their ecosystem  The even more dangerous aspect of selling exclusively to friendly customers is the potential for false confirmation bias  Inner circles are often met with friendly faces who will applaud you  and may even pay you   but the outside world provides a much more sincere viewpoint on market validation  This is especially true for companies selling to other early stage startups  Jason Lemkin has opined on this in the past  highlighting that first instance of traction doesn t really occur until you have  10 Unaffiliated  Paying Customers    2  Selling to Non Core Customers  Founders hungry to bring on customers can often be pythons  gobbling up anything in their site to hit their financial projections  At times  these customers can steer founders away from true product market fit and towards their own internal needs  Companies that follow this path often end up with extensive customization or succumb to inferior acquisition economics at scale   3  Non Repeatable CX  Rightfully so  founders are always willing to go the extra mile to keep customers happy  At the onset of a business  however  this can prove problematic if customers require overly extensive customization  implementation timelines or customer support  Each of these elements is a necessary part of maintaining enterprise customers  but when this process becomes too burdensome and nuanced to scale it implies that your product and GTM may not scalable  This can lead to churn when customers realize that the company ultimately needs to charge for these white glove services  This goes back to point  2  as it becomes incredibly hard to scale your CX function unless you are selling to the right customers   4  Pilots and Renewal Cycles  Early enterprise customers can often be deceiving in their level of commitment to a fledgling startup  For an early stage company  signing a blue chip Fortune 1000 customer to a six figure ACV deal feels like a tremendous win  For that same Fortune 1000 company  it s infinitely less significant  Given the democratization of procurement authority in most large companies  getting a check from a Fortune 1000 customers isn t as big of a deal as it used to be  Large customers frequently promise six figure pilots and POCs  but it s really hard to tell whether you have real institutional buy in  This is further amplified by a cloud environment that enables enterprises to try solutions with limited buy in and or risk  The lure of a blue chip customer may seem compelling  but even when a customer is signed  there is little certainty about their longevity until they ve undergone several renewal cycles or an enterprise wide deployment   5  Phantom Customer Acquisition   Retention Economics  I blame this on the investors  Founders read a blog post about CAC LTV ratios and feel compelled to back into a number for their investment deck  Unfortunately  it s impossible for any sales driven enterprise business  especially one that is founder led  to know their true customer acquisition economics this early in the game  Customer acquisition costs undoubtedly will go up over time  unless you have a network effect based business  and you can t reliably determine churn without multi year cohort data  Mark Suster has opined on the imprecise nature of customer acquisition economics and how it can be a major pitfall for early stage companies  Numbers dressed up for an investment presentation are essentially theoretical for a Seed stage business  but nonetheless are in virtually every deck I see   These fallacies don t apply to all enterprise businesses  but they do to most  Exceptions to the rule tend to be companies selling to SMBs or developer communities where customer sample sizes are larger or those monetizing through marketplace models where GMV can provide early signals on adoption  In the more traditional cases  e g  enterprise SaaS   there are times where early customers may provide SOME insight  but ultimately should be discounted for the reasons above  In my experience  the more telling signals for the business will likely be their team and approach to the market  The companies that I often worry about the most are the ones where we rationalized investment based on some early signals without a true love for the product  market and or team   and I believe this holds true across enterprise AND consumer   I recognize this must prove frustrating to founders  All too often  the feedback given to an early stage company is  you re a bit early  but let s stay in touch and let us know how we can be helpful   I ll admit it  I ve given this feedback myself  The truth is  it s really hard to turn that response to an investment unless there is a radical change in the business and or trajectory and by that point the company is usually on to its next round of funding   For most great companies  the path to success is non linear which is why a few additional months of incremental 15  MoM growth are unlikely to get an investor off the cliff from investing if they weren t excited about it from the beginning  Fortunately for founders  the Series A process is different  It s VERY metrics based and those milestones can often serve as a guiding force to demonstrating product market fit  For founders unable to get the traditional cast of Seed stage venture firms excited about their idea  grind through it and the more data driven Series A investors will appreciate you for your metrics  For those with the right expertise  empathy and approach for massive market opportunities  I d love to talk   Special thanks to Jonathan Lehr of Work Bench  Patrick Chang of Samsung  and Ali Afridi   Eric Ong of

654,training-dataset/business/567.txt,business,How Do VCs Choose Their Investors  and should entrepreneurs care  How Do VCs Choose Their Investors  and should entrepreneurs care    I recently read a blog post by Beezer Clarkson  Managing Director of Sapphire Ventures about why entrepreneurs should care about from whom their VC funds raise their capital   I spent a bunch of time thinking about this position   especially since Beezer is an investor in Upfront Ventures  There are a lot of things I think entrepreneurs should care about when raising from a VC   How big or small their fund is   What percentage of their fund will you be   How much money will they reserve from their fund for future investments in your startup   How much pull that investment professional has within his or her fund   which matters for getting future support   Where the fund is in its investment cycle  year 1 out of 10 or year 7 out of 10    How much experience they have in your sector   I could go on for a long time  Maybe I ll save that for a future post  But should entrepreneurs really care whom the LPs of a fund are  I m still not sure   But I do know that VCs should care a great deal about whom their LPs are and I find that some are less thoughtful than they could or should be  We were in the very fortunate position of having more than  425 million in commitments for our last fund  which only raised  280 million  We capped our fund size so that we would stay true to our investment strategy in terms of size  scope and number of partners as we stood in 2014 when we raised the fund   And we felt terrible not being able to let every LP in but we were forced to make some hard compromises yet we opened up our fund to Sapphire even though they were a first time LP   Why   1  Truly Focused on VC   Knowledgeable About How Partnerships Work  One of the things I value in an LP is a really passionate and inside knowledge of the venture capital industry  There are many LPs who invest in VC one day  oil   gas the next and timber on Wednesday  I ve met many smart and capable people like this but it was also clear that many of them didn t have an intimate knowledge of what is truly unique to venture   Beezer did  She has formerly worked at a VC fund  DFJ  and worked closely with the partners and the network at DFJ and knew what it was like to build  manage and evolve a VC partnership  So I immediately felt like I had a partner whom I could call for sensitive advice on topics where there aren t many sources of input or mentorship  It s the same reason I think many entrepreneurs like working with VCs who had formerly been entrepreneurs   2  Help with Hard to Access People  Of course I also appreciate the fact that with Sapphire came better access to the executive team at SAP  including organizing a small dinner with their CEO so I could learn first hand where they see the future going  We have many LPs who come from industry and this is truly a value add in a LP VC relationship  3  Stable Capital  Amongst the hardest things to find when one raises a new fund is ability to have stable capital  Many of the sources of capital for new funds come from investors who can t necessarily back you in good times and bad   We lived that first hand  Our first LPs from 1996 were industry players who put us in business  Carrefour  the large European retailer   DLJ  the former investment bank  and a billionaire software exec  As venture fell out of favor all three pulled out of the asset class  Even though our 2000 fund was the single best performing fund in the United States for that vintage  continuing to get investments wasn t possible so we had to rebuild   We rebuilt our base and secured what we thought was the perfect anchor only to find out that a strategy change for the firm meant our lead was moving from VC to timber and they pulled out of VC altogether  This was in 2010   exactly the wrong time to be pulling out of venture   So you really want LPs who invest in the category in good markets and bad  And as a VC you still need to earn the right to get allocations when you raise new funds but that s within your control   Many VCs have turned to Foundations and University Endowments  F Es  as a source of stable capital and this has certainly been a strong pillar for many a VC fund  We ourselves decided to build   35  of our fund with F Es   What s interesting about Sapphire is that they have now raised on an  evergreen structure  with  1 billion new fund  across LP investing and direct investing into portfolio   So we see them with the same long term eye as we would our other sources of capital   Summary  Should entrepreneurs care that we have Sapphire as an LP  Well   only in so much as we have an easier time than others in getting technology entrepreneurs in front of executives at SAP when appropriate   But to other VCs   when you go to raise money   we ve been thrilled with our choice to work with Sapphire  They ve been a great partner  delivered on what they said they would do and working with Beezer has felt like working with any other VC I work with  She knows our business and often acts like an entrepreneur herself   For that   I m grateful  Congrats on your new fund  Beezer and Nino  And thank you for having the conviction to back Upfront,"[654 182 932 1158 545 1 943 812 751 1378 398]"

Buffer Pocket Tumblr Mail Meneame  To celebrate the launch of my book The Art of Startup Fundraising  I thought it would be interesting to put together a blog post with a good amount of pitch decks from companies that have managed to tell their story in a way in which it was attractive enough to convince outside investors to jump onboard and invest millions   I was actually deeply inspired to write this post after reviewing the masterful piece that Alexander Jarvis published on its blog   You can read his full post here  In fact  I took a good amount of his knowledge  graphics  and commentary to write this piece   As an entrepreneur you need to be a rockstar at storytelling if you want to land capital from investors during your financing rounds  The earlier you are in your venture the more people would look at investing in you and your potential future  For that reason the best entrepreneurs are not visionaries  The best entrepreneurs are excellent at sales and storytelling   Something that you will see on all these pitch decks is how they are very similar to one another  The length of pitch decks averages 19 slides  Most of these pitch decks highlight in the best possible way the following slides   Product  Team  Business Model  Market Size  Company Purpose  As I mention during the Fundraising Certification  which is a 3 week comprehensive course on fundraising for entrepreneurs  if the company has already been in the market operating for some time then investors would really appreciate a slide called traction where you talk about the progress month over month  If you d like to dive deeper in the structure via research then you should read my post 14 Slides You Need to Raise Capital   Lastly before jumping into the pitch decks I would

687,training-dataset/business/1113.txt,business,Venture Capital is About Human Capital   Both Sides of the TableVenture Capital is About Human Capital  Gregg Johnson  CEO of Invoca  For the first 5 years or so after I became a VC I didn t talk much about what I thought a VC should be excellent at since frankly I wasn t sure  I was mostly doing my job and trying to figure out how to be better every day   After a decade on the job I ve started to speak more openly when newer industry colleagues now ask me what I ve learned   The number one advice I give is  stop trying to be too smart   Most VCs did well academically and had enough career success that a venture firm was willing to give them an investment role or they were able to raise their own fund  It s easy to think the role of a VC is to have strong opinions about markets  trends  tech dynamics and so forth  We think we re supposed to act smart and have insights that others don t possess   I don t think this is the job   Entrepreneurs are supposed to have insights that others don t have and we re supposed to be good judges about which entrepreneurs and executives have both the most clever ideas and the right skill sets to do transformational things against all odds   So I tell people we re fundamentally in the people business  Our core skill is being able to identify talent and how to persuade the most talented people with whom we have access that we would be valuable to work with  We then help surround founders with other talent who want to join important causes but don t have the startup idea themselves  We help founders through difficult moments  we help coach  we act as sparring partners  we help them resolve conflicts when they re fighting with co founders and we help them deal with adversity as well as successes   That s why I often say  The role of VC is  chief psychologist    We might help a management team deal with a vexing strategic question or a thorny negotiation but these are mostly tactical  The biggest difference we can make is helping support talented teams with complementary talent  Think about how profound a difference adding Sheryl Sandberg early at Facebook was to Mark Zuckerberg and knowing that he should stay in charge of product and strategy while she ran operations   Fundamentally venture capital is about human capital   The role of VC is sparring partner  The role is to challenge the thinking precisely because we get a bird s eye view across many situations and many of us have been in the driver s seat ourselves in our younger days   And as a VC I often cultivate relationships with the most talented people with whom I ve worked over the years and look for opportunities to work with them again  It s rare to find extraordinarily talented individuals who are natural leaders and who are driven to succeed and who have a passion for startups so when you do you work hard to find opportunities for them   Today I couldn t be more delighted to tell you about one such individual   Gregg Johnson   who just left Salesforce com after 10 years to come and be the CEO of Invoca  a company I proudly backed   Gregg and I worked together at Salesforce more than a decade ago  Gregg was a graduate of Stanford and a Wharton MBA and had worked at the consulting firm BCG so I knew he was smart and capable  But what I noticed about my time with Gregg was how quickly he turned thoughts into actions  I noticed that team members naturally gravitated to him because he was a doer more than a pontificator  And in an industry of sharp elbows he is amongst the most likable people I know   So when I left and became a VC I stayed in close touch with Gregg and he was on my very short list to hopefully work with again one day  The rest of our team included the founding CTO of Maker Studios  Ryan Lissack  and the CEO of DataSift  Tim Barker  so we seemed to all be in good company of ex Salesforce execs looking to make a difference   But Gregg stayed and grew and took on more responsibilities and became a senior member of Salesforce s Marketing Cloud team  I think he wanted a meaty role if he was going to leave and finally we had something compelling   Invoca has grown its enterprise customer base 550  in the past three years including major customers like Microsoft  Allstate and SunTrust  It has grown recurring revenue by more than 500  and deal size by 276   Importantly  we recently announced a  30 million financing that gives us the resources we need to build a global enterprise software company   For years I struggled to convince people that phone calls mattered  While everybody was infatuated with the  truthy  belief that in the future nobody will make calls as we all interact with AI chatbots  the volume of calls has exploded with inbound calls to businesses skyrocketing to nearly 170 billion per year over the next few years   The explosion of mobile phones has led to a boom in inbound click to call traffic that has proven to convert at a higher close rate and increase average order value over web only sales   marketing  For some of my more skeptical portfolio companies I simply asked them to run a trial of inbound sales calls and they were shocked  For some companies it is now   70  of the deals they re closing and they ve seen it as their secret weapon   Marketing departments  software partners and investors have now woken up to this opportunity   The existing Invoca team has been in place and functioning incredibly well the last few years and I m so honored that Gregg has decided to come on board and help lead us to the next level   I have often said that  a few key people make all the difference in any company   no matter how big or small  and that is my core principle as a VC  I can try to be as smart as possible on market trends  industry dynamics and so forth   In the end I know the only true differentiator in venture capital is the company you keep  It s the people who want to work with you  It s the founders who are willing to let you join their boards  It s the executives who trust you to join the early stage startups you ve funded  It s the executives at bigger companies who trust you and are willing to partner with the startups you ve backed because they know your word is good   Venture Capital is a people business  Nothing fancier  And the real talent are the teams on the

711,training-dataset/business/1259.txt,business,DilutionThere has probably been more capital looking to invest in private technology companies in the past five years than any five year period before   An obvious consequence of this increased supply is that company valuations  i e  prices  have gone up  and so has the amount of capital raised by most companies   A non obvious consequence is that although people raise more money at higher valuations  they still end up selling much more of the company   For a long time  when the early stage fundraising market was much tougher  YC s standard advice to companies was to raise as much as they reasonably could  Someday that advice will likely be correct again  but right now  the market has shifted   It sounds like a better deal to raise  5 million on a  10 million pre money valuation  selling 33  of the company to investors  than  615 000 at a  2 4 million pre money valuation  selling  20  of the company to investors  which is what Airbnb did   But this is only true if you put the money to exceptionally good use  Otherwise  you may end up with a lower dollar value of the equity you keep   Today  each percentage point of Airbnb is worth about  300 million  I expect them to be worth more in future  If you hope your company will one day be extremely successful  then treat your equity as such   The one place I recommend not being stingy with equity is when it comes to giving it to employees most founders  instincts seem to be to give too much equity to investors and not enough to employees    Terms like  seed round  and  Series A  are less clear than they used to be  but in general  I recommend companies think about selling 10 15  in a seed round and 15 25  in their A round  and about 7  if they go through an accelerator   When these combine into one large initial round  I suggest trying to sell no more than 30  of the company in total   I also suggest founders take the time to model this all out  or use Angelcalc  built by my partner Geoff Ralston   Founders are often surprised about how choosing to raise less helps protect their ownership more than negotiating valuation does   Of course  it s easy to take this advice too far  It s more important not to run out of money than almost anything else   I have recently seen several examples of companies doing pretty well and going out to raise B rounds with investors already owning 50 60  of the company  In all cases  they are having a tough time  As one very successful investor says   one of the immutable laws of venture is that there are only 100 points on the cap table   At some point  it gets hard to make it all work  Selling a few percentage points too many won t kill you  but selling 30 points too many may   Remember that raising money is not success  Raising huge amounts of money early on is very rarely how companies win  though it is sometimes how companies lose   Be one of those companies that does a lot with a little  instead of a little with a lot  Resist the urge to seek validation by having a long list of impressive sounding investors   Constraints are wonderfully focusing  Excess capital usually ends up making its way into the hands of landlords of some sort anyway  And if you end up being the next Airbnb  you ll be really happy you held on to that equity,"[711 943 470 545 1378 1 848 286 1238 1044 1317]"
730,training-dataset/business/291.txt,business,What Founders Need to Know About Debt FinanceWhile many hopeful companies waiting on venture capitalists and angel investors to see if they can get funding  these aren t the only options for getting money  Laura Johnson  a friend to the Founder Institute network  outlines the various options of getting money by debt financing in her blog post below   If you are a founder of a small business  then you know the importance of being able to access cash infusions to grow your business  While equity in the form of angel and venture capital investments tends to get most of the attention  another form of finance is debt  This includes business loans  inventory  and working capital loans  as well as venture debt  With that in mind  here is a quick guide to what founders need to know about debt finance   Small Business Loans  For years small business loans were the only option for founders who were seeking to raise growth capital for their companies  But times have changed and bank loans  while still important  are not the only sources of capital for founders  Several  alternative lenders  have burst on the scene in recent years and these lenders specialize in helping the founders of early stage companies get financed  If you want to learn more about the differences between alternative lender and bank lenders  then check out this blog post   One difference is how the varying sources look at the bankability of small businesses  For banks  the focus is solely on limiting exposure to risk and this means tying the loan to an asset of greater or equal value  While alternative lenders are offer more flexibility  most of their loans are best suited for short term needs  So  remember a simple precept when taking on loans for your business   long term loans for long term needs and short term loans for short term needs   Invoice Financing  Invoice financing includes products such as factoring and discounting  Both are short term debt financing options which can help founders get paid today for products they will sell tomorrow  This can be a useful option for founders of a product based business  especially if you are selling to large companies or in large volumes   By selling a portion of your receivables today  you can get the funds you need to buy materials and pay labor costs  but founders should be mindful of two things  First  your ability to finance your receivables is based on the creditworthiness of your customers  Second  this form of financing does come with a cost  and it might be more effective to offer your customers a discount for prepayment  So  sit down with your advisors to figure out the right option for your business   Revolving Credit Lines  In some ways  this operates like a credit card for your business in that you will have a credit limit and you can reuse the line once the payment is made on the principal  The benefit of a revolving credit line is the opportunity to strategically pump up your working capital as your company grows  Any founder worth their salt knows the value of having such an option at their disposal   Remember  this is also a short term option and should be used only to accelerate a proven growth path which will drive revenues  If you are thinking of using a revolving credit line for anything else  then you might want to sit with your CFO and rethink your planning   Microloans  A microloan can be extremely useful for an early stage company who needs money fast but does not need a lot  These loans often range from  500 to  35 000 and in some cases  lenders will consider borrowers with bad credit  Similar to other forms of debt finance reviewed in this article  these loans are best suited for short term needs which can be repaid quickly   Venture Debt  These loans are often used to alongside equity investments and can lower the cost of a capital or provide cash infusions to help a founder reach escape velocity  Another thing to know about venture debt is that it is usually taken on just before  or during  a follow on capital raise  In this way  a founder does not further dilute equity  while powering the growth needed to garner the interest of additional investors   However  it is debt and it will need to be repaid  usually out of the additional capital infusion  At the same time  there are risks as failure to hit growth targets within the term of the loan could mean that a founder is faced with servicing this debt while trying to bring on investors  and this could lead cause potential investors to question the viability of your startup or of your management team       Laura Johnson is a part time blogger and full time adventurer  She enjoys writing about anything that sparks her interest  This especially includes her passion for business and branding,"[730 842 751 1381 1 1378 752 68 545 856 1317]"

752,training-dataset/business/1354.txt,business,A Dozen Things I ve Learned from Naval Ravikant about Investing  Business and Startups  Naval Ravikant  is an entrepreneur and angel investor  a co author of Venture Hacks  and a co maintainer of AngelList  Previously he was a co founder at Genoa Corp  acquired by Finisar   Epinions com  IPO via Shopping com   and Vast com  white label classifieds marketplace     1   The cost of starting a company has collapsed    As the cost of running a startup experiment is coming down  more experiments are being run    Three years ago  companies could for the first time get all the way through a prototype of a service before they even raised seed money  Two years ago  they could make it through launch before raising money  Now  they can start to get traction with a user base by the time they come looking for seed money   A capitalist economy is an evolutionary system  Innovation and best practices are discovered by the experimentation of entrepreneurs who try to establish the evolutionary fitness of their business  Products and services created as part of this experimentation which have greater fitness survive and other less fit products and services die  Entrepreneurs are essentially running experiments in this evolutionary system when they create or alter a business  Entrepreneurs are engaged in  deductive tinkering  as they search for better products and services  Eric Ries describes the process in this way   Learning how to build a sustainable business is the outcome of experiments  which follow  a three step process  Build  measure  learn    Why is experimentation so important in an economy  The answer is that experimentation is the best way to deal with one of nature s solutions to dealing with risk  uncertainty and ignorance  a complex adaptive system  An economy is a complex system in that it is networked and therefore adaptive in ways that a simple formalism  such as used in physics  will fail to predict  Michael Mauboussin explains    A complex adaptive system has three characteristics  The first is that the system consists of a number of heterogeneous agents  and each of those agents makes decisions about how to behave  The most important dimension here is that those decisions will evolve over time  The second characteristic is that the agents interact with one another  That interaction leads to the third something that scientists call emergence  In a very real way  the whole becomes greater than the sum of the parts  The key issue is that you can t really understand the whole system by simply looking at its individual parts    In the case of complex adaptive systems like an economy or a business  the correct approach is to discover solutions via trial and error rather than try to predict  Nassim Taleb describes why the experimentation approach works well   it is in complex systems  ones in which we have little visibility of the chains of cause consequences  that tinkering  bricolage  or similar variations of trial and error have been shown to vastly outperform the teleological it is nature s modus operandi  But tinkering needs to be convex  it is imperative   Critically  what is desired is to  have the option  not the obligation to keep the result  which allows us to retain the upper bound and be unaffected by adverse outcomes   What Taleb is talking about is  convexity  which is something I have written a lot about recently  As an example of convex financial proposition  all a founder or venture capitalist can lose is 100  of what they invest in a startup and yet what they can potentially gain is potentially many multiples of that investment  People will inevitably say when the topic of complex adaptive systems comes up that nothing has emerged from research in this area that allows you to predict the future  which ignores the point that knowing what you can t predict is one of the most valuable things you can know  Discovery which happens via experimentation via trial and error is a vastly superior way to deal with unpredictability than trying to predict what can t be predicted   It is important to note that Ravikant in the quotes above is talking about a specific type of business experiment  One way to look at the impact of business startups is to group them into two categories   Some startups are an attempt to create entirely new categories of businesses at global scale  e g   Uber  Salesforce com or Airbnb    Some startups are about incremental or local innovation  such as a new frozen yogurt shop or sushi restaurant   The number of businesses trying to create value in category 1 through business experiments has substantially increased  Comparing a category 1 startup  e g   a business that will try to achieve a level of success similar to Uber or Airbnb  to a category 2 startup  e g   new frozen yogurt store on main street  is apples and oranges  As an aside  I believe anyone doing something like opening up a new restaurant or main street retailer deserves a medal for bravery  The competition they face on a daily basis is brutal  These category 2 entrepreneurs are vitally important parts of the what makes capitalism work    It is also important to understand how much bigger category 2 is than category 1  The number of startups that obtain venture finance for the first time in a given year is relatively small  There are   700 800 firms per quarter in the US which raise venture capital for the first time  This data is from PitchBook   In addition to firms that actually obtain professional venture capital funding there are also a much larger number of startups that are able to conduct experiments based on the personal capital of founders even before seed  I m not aware of anyone who has compiled a reliable estimate of how many category 1 startup experiments fail to raise seed capital or bootstrap the business to success  but it is a significant number  The same problem exists for anyone trying to estimate how many startups raise some  friends and family  money  This activity is just to diffuse and distributed to be accurately estimated  Nevertheless  the lower cost of conducting a startup experiments has increased the number of experiments and the level of innovation is higher as a result   Comparing category 1 to category 2 shows how much bigger the latter category actually is in terms of absolute numbers    Firms are individual businesses  while establishments include multiple outlets for existing firms  The Brookings report specifically discussed entrepreneurship  which is why it used the numbers for firms   The distinction between a new Chase Bank branch opening in your neighborhood versus a brand new community bank is critical   particularly when studying entrepreneurship    The most recent data from Census  released in September 2014  that showed firm deaths in 2012  424 864  still outnumbered births  410 001   That s a difference of 14 863  and the figures showed that the gap had been narrowing each year since deaths first outnumbered births by 90 670 in 2009  But  it turns out  Census had released new numbers for 2013 in September of this year  And in doing so  it revised its figures for past years  The latest statistics now show that in 2012  firm births  411 252  were higher than firm deaths  375 192  by 36 060  And the same held true for 2013  when births outnumbered deaths by 5 666  We can expect that figure to be revised  too  when Census releases new figures in the future   the latest numbers show that more firms are opening than closing   My trip to Omaha for the Berkshire shareholder meeting this year was interesting for many reasons but one fact that struck me was how many business  especially in West Omaha  are franchises   A paper prepared for the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland  in August 2014 said there had been a shift away from brand new businesses toward new outlets of existing businesses  a trend that many Americans may have seen in their own communities   The Shifting Source of New Business Establishments and New Jobs   Aug  21  2014  We find that while new firms have been forming at a slower pace over the past 33 years and creating fewer jobs  there has been a simultaneous rise in the number of new establishments opened by existing businesses  which we will call new outlets     Markets that used to be served by independent entrepreneurs creating businesses are now increasingly being served by the expansion of existing businesses   There are a lot more business in 2 category in absolute numbers but it is category 1 that generates the most fundamental innovation  Do I wish there was more business entry in category 2 and that they were more successful more often  Definitely  Lots of jobs are created and taxes paid by businesses in category 2   The additional point that must be considered is that innovation in category 1 can cause both more business failure and more new business starts in category 2  The outcome of this process varies since any given innovation can increase profit or not  Whether profit is generated by any given innovation is determined by the presence of a moat  Am I saying that some innovation at an aggregate level produces no profit or even less overall profit  Yes  Charlie Munger explains the phenomenon best    When technology moves as fast as it does in a civilization like ours  you get a phenomenon which I call competitive destruction  You know  you have the finest buggy whip factory and all of a sudden in comes this little horseless carriage  And before too many years go by  your buggy whip business is dead  You either get into a different business or you re dead you re destroyed  It happens again and again and again  There are all kinds of wonderful new inventions that give you nothing as owners except the opportunity to spend a lot more money in a business that s still going to be lousy  The money still won t come to you  All of the advantages from great improvements are going to flow through to the customers    2   Success rates are definitely coming down but that is because the cost of running a startup experiment is coming down so more experiments are being run  In the old days  we would have one company spend  10 million to figure out if it has a market  Today  maybe that same company could do it under  1 2 million  The capital  as a whole  may make the same or better returns  but yeah  if the failures don t cost a half of what they used to  you are actually saving money  it is a more efficient market   More experiments inevitably means more failures on an absolute basis  In addition  as the rate of business experimentation rises there will inevitably be an increase in the number of poseurs trying to create new businesses and that will increase failure rates  A lower overall success rate caused by an increase in the number of experiments is a positive tradeoff overall since society benefits from the increased level of innovation  This net benefit for society is created even though most experiments fail and some experiments are being conducted on the margin by poseurs who have little or no idea what they are doing  Success is found by any given business via negativa  For this reason  some failure is essential to the capitalist process since it is what fuels success  What the collapse of the cost of running business experiments has done is radically increased the pace of the discovery process that creates innovation  Because the creative destruction process is now operating as if it has taken steroids  the rate at which profit is turned into consumer surplus has never been greater  especially in the technology sector   A real economy is messy and there is lots of failure  Failure is in fact an essential part of the process of creating innovation and a healthy economy  A fantasy economy in which fully informed and perfectly rational agents interact with perfect efficiency is believed to reflect reality only by a few people suffering from extreme forms of psychological denial  A child of ten knows humans are not perfectly informed and rational  Failure is literally everywhere and is essential to making capitalism work given the economy is a nest of complex adaptive systems   Despite the fact that experimentation is beneficial  it is interesting to think about whether there can be too much failure  Does the existence of too many startups in a given area like a city lower the overall benefit by diluting the talent available for startups of higher quality  I have argued previously that there is a Goldilocks  just right  level of startups that is unique for each city  That city A has a huge number of startups should not be the test of success but rather  what is the outcome of that activity  As many startups as are created in the Bay Area of California may not be optimal for a city like Seattle or New York  How big is the city  How much supporting infrastructure exists  What alternative employment opportunities exist  Does the city s culture reward or punish failure  Is the culture in that city most supportive of missionaries or mercenaries  Does the city have a major research university   At some level  the ability of an economy to grow is a brake on the overall level of success that can be created in a given time frame like a year or decade  To illustrate  Warren Buffett made a comment once that could be applied to unicorns waiting to go public as a group    Think about a  bunch of unicorns with a combined private valuation of   500 billion  To justify paying this price   they  would have to earn  50 billion every year until perpetuity  assuming a 10  discount rate  And if the  businesses don t  begin this payout for a year  the figure rises to  55 billion annually  and if you wait three years   66 5 billion  Think about how many businesses today earn  50 billion  or  40 billion  or  30 billion  It would require a rather extraordinary change in profitability to justify that  valuation     Regarding the amount that has been invested in breakthrough innovation  Mattermark calculates   we found that 75  of the approximately  108 billion that investors deployed into these  software  companies is still locked up in private coffers    I am conformable in predicting that I do not know who the outcome will be  Lots of unicorns may go public in the next year or two with an IPO  but perhaps in many cases only with a down round  That company A can t go public at a valuation greater than  1 billion does not mean that it can t go public at some price  Or maybe large numbers of unicorns will go public at flat or even higher levels  Of course some unicorns may be bought by large already profitable firms for defensive reasons  which allows financial exits by startups to exceed aggregate GDP growth by some amount  We will see what happens soon enough  That s part of the uncertainty and fun of this process   3   The funding market is so bifurcated because outcomes are so bifurcated    Startup outcomes fall on a power law distribution  So startup financings look the same way  You re un fundable until you re oversubscribed   The financial returns from a tiny number of startups have always driven venture capital returns due the inherent convexity of technological innovation  This distribution of financial returns inevitably takes the form of a power law for the best venture capital firms  As just one example to illustrate  the ten biggest exits from 2014 look like this   2005 looks like this   Ravikant explains   The nature of the markets have in many cases become more consumerized  People have caught on to how network effects work   Network effects are increasingly driving financial success which phenomenon causes investors to put more investment into a smaller number of startups and firms that are deemed to have momentum  As a result  some firms can easily raise billions of dollars if investors see potential network effects  while other firms can t raise even small amounts of capital   I recently had a discussion on Twitter with Dave McClure  who I respect a lot  about the power laws in venture capital and my view is that a firm like 500 Startups that makes over 150 200 investments a year has a fundamentally different portfolio that a venture capital firm in the top decile of historical performance that makes   10 investments a year  One recent survey survey reported that the average venture capital firm looks at 400 business a year and invests in only 5 businesses on average during that year  That data would means that these venture capitalists are investing in about 1  of the businesses they consider  McClure says that his financial return data does not look like a power law  but my view is that this does not mean other venture capital firms that embrace more convexity and make fewer investments do not have a return distribution that looks like a power law  All the data I have seen over the years indicates that top venture capital firms have a return distribution that reflect a power law  My thesis is that these views can be reconciled by looking at the composition of the two different portfolios  When financial exits reflect a power law and the head of the distribution is only a handful of companies  investing at a very high rate in any given year inevitably means you are in the tail for more investments   My thesis is that the 500 Startups portfolio is fundamentally different than the portfolio of a firm that Peter Thiel talks about below  This is from a blog post by Jerry Neumann linked to in the notes below    At a given alpha  the more investments you make  the better  because your mean return multiple increases with the number of investments  as does the likeliest highest multiple  Dave McClure makes this case    Most VC funds are far too concentrated in a small number   20 40  of companies  The industry would be better served by doubling or tripling the average   of investments in a portfolio  particularly for early stage investors where startup attrition is even greater  If unicorns happen only 1 2  of the time  it logically follows that portfolio size should include a minimum of 50 100  companies in order to have a reasonable shot at capturing these elusive and mythical creatures    Peter Thiel flatly contradicts this    Given a big power law distribution  you want to be fairly concentrated  If you invest in 100 companies to try and cover your bases through volume  there s probably sloppy thinking somewhere  There just aren t that many businesses that you can have the requisite high degree of conviction about    McClure believes he can find hundreds of companies with high enough growth to maintain his requisite alpha  Thiel thinks this is not possible  Venture capitalists have always faced this tension  the average growth rate of all small businesses in the US is closer to 7 5  than 30   The pool of companies that can grow fast enough is limited    My view is that both McClure s and Thiel s approaches to venture capital can be successful just as Warren Buffett and Ray Dalio can be successful with different investing approaches  The financial out performance can come from different sources of mis pricing for each of the two approaches  One interesting point  would venture capital firms in the lower two quartiles improve performance by investing more like 500 Startups  The old joke is that all VC firms are in the top quartile  or at least that is what they say to their limited partners  Do you know any limited partners who have been pitched by a venture capital firms that says it is in the bottom quartile   The discussion in this blog post to this point has not addressed more than a few questions  Why are financial outcomes in venture capital and business in general so bifurcated  What explains the presence of power law distributions  This topic is worthy of its own blog post  but in my view the simplest explanation is that there are many forms of feedback in a world that is a nest of adaptive complex systems and that feedback in all its forms creates the power law distributions  I have always loved this statement by Richard Feynman   Imagine how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings   Duncan Watts describes how this manifests itself in this way   individuals do not make decisions independently  but rather are influenced by behavior of others   Humans are not like electrons  they have emotions  do things like herd and otherwise copy each other  That behavior can cause success and failure to feed back on itself  which produces outcomes that under the right conditions reflect a power law   4  The Internet is very efficiently arbitraged  Anything you can think of has been thought of and tried  The only way you re going to find something is if you stick to it  at an irrational level and try a whole bunch of things   The number of business experiments being conducted is increasing so quickly that the more obvious opportunity spaces for entrepreneurs are being exhausted with unprecedented efficiency and speed  There is no place to hide from the relentless pace of competition if the business person s plan is to do something conventional  This places a premium on genuine product breakthroughs  often resulting from original research and development  In other words  convexity as a source of out performance is more important than ever   5   You get paid for being right first  and to be first  you can t wait for consensus   An investor can t beat the market if they are the market  This is the point made so well by investors like Howard Marks  It is mathematically provable that being right will not lead to outperformance if the consensus forecast is also right  Howard Marks puts is this way   To achieve superior investment results  your insight into value has to be superior  Thus you must learn things others don t  see things differently or do a better job of analyzing them   ideally all three   Ravikant is saying that you also need to do it first  If you are not first  the bet will probably become consensus before you can capitalize on that bet   6   The market has to be huge because everyone makes mistakes  You never quite get it right the first time  Companies that don t do giant pivots are always doing micro pivots  You need a large enough market that you can pivot in and you still have a customer base   The convexity of a business investment  potentially massive upside and small potential downside  has never been so important  Having a huge addressable market increases the convexity of the potential financial outcome since it increases optionality  Small addressable markets provide entrepreneurs with fewer options and are not as likely to be convex   7    A  1 billion seed fund would  destroy the entire market and put prices up 20  overnight    We don t think we can allocate that kind of capital without distorting the market    Even the  400 million  we raised  will be spread out over six to eight years  Maybe the first year  we ll deploy  20 or 30 million as we figure out the model  and then scale it out   The market for venture capital is top down constrained by the potential for financial exits  This scalability problem in the venture capital business that Fred Wilson and others have written about means that in a country like the US only about 800 startups per quarter raised venture capital for the first time  If seed stage valuations get too high  the market can become distorted since it can become hard to raise funds in later rounds  Angel and seed considered together is only slightly higher as this chart indicates   As I noted above the economy is limited in its ability to generate exists at some level  Yes it can rise more over time with the right environment in place but number of financial exits doesn t just suddenly jump 10x when overall GDP is increasing only at low single digit levels  One thing that may take the possible exit total higher is that some startup firms are purchased even though only consumers benefit from their existence and there is no net increase in GDP  This creates a weird asymmetry where startups can win without ever making a profit in some cases  The idea that sometimes only consumers benefit from innovation escapes many people  Some innovations have a moat and create profit and some innovations do not have a moat and create no profit   8   It s just as hard to build a large company as it is a small company  so you might as well build a big company  It s roughly the same effort   This is yet another point related to convexity  The bigger the upside the greater the convexity   9   I use Warren Buffett s criteria for assessing the Team  Intelligence  Integrity and Energy  You want someone who is really smart  very hard working and trustworthy  A lot of people forget the integrity part  because if you don t have that  then you have a really hard working crook and they will find a way to cheat you    Intelligence and energy are easier to measure  Integrity is the most important factor   An honest colleague or partners with integrity increases the convexity of an investment since trust gives you more options  Decisions can get made faster and with greater confidence  The work is fun  Life is better  People have actually does research to prove that people who life in high trust societies are happier  A lot of research has also been done on how trust is a key enabler of an economy  The studies show that  high trust societies achieve higher economic growth due to lower transaction costs  Since trust protects property and contractual rights  it is not necessary to divert resources from production to protection   These same ideas about the value of trust are fractal and exist at a company and personal level   10   Companies only fail for two reasons  The founder gives up or they run out money    Don t be proud  Get the cash wherever you can  Cash is everything    Raise twice as much and make it last four times as long  Pretend that you don t have the money in the bank  run lean  Assuming your unit economics are at least breakeven  keep your headcount low  raise money and stay in it for the long haul  It takes a decade to build a great company  There s no shortcuts   The only unforgivable sin in business is to run out of cash  What does cash give a business  Options  What do options create  Convexity  By now you have probably figured out that convexity is everywhere if you know how to look   There is a whole set of companies that are not financeable by the venture community  service businesses  markets that are heavily played out  if you are fighting a war that has already been won you better have some really core differentiation and traction   Other disqualifiers include  not enough technical people on the team if you are completely out of market  pre launch companies tend to not do well teams that have no credibility  The companies that fail to raise funding are the ones who use too many words and too few actions  Your biography is a record of your past actions  Your execution on your current business is a record of your current actions  Talking about what you are going to do in the future is almost pointless  Talking about what you can become is almost pointless  People want evidence  There is a lot of talk out there   Most startups will not be able to raise venture capital  That is not the end of the world for those businesses  There are many ways to finance a business that do not involve venture capital   11   When building a startup  microeconomics is fundamental  macroeconomics is entertainment    Getting real traction is hard  Raising millions of dollars is hard  Building a sustainable  long term company is hard  Your pre traction company has not achieved product market fit and so it has a hard time hiring    There isn t a shortage of developers and designers  There s a surplus of founders   Understanding microeconomics is essential if you want to be successful in business  The distinction between these two types of economics was explained at the 2016 Berkshire shareholder meeting by Charlie Munger who said   Microeconomics is what we do  macro is what we have to put up with   Munger and Buffett elaborated on that point during this interchange   BUFFETT   Charlie and I read a lot and we re interested in economic matters and political matters for that matter and so we re familiar with almost all of that macroeconomic factors  That doesn t mean we know where they re going to lead  For example  where zero interest rates are going to lead    MUNGER   We pay a lot of attention to microeconomic factors  If you re talking about macro we don t know anything more than anybody else    BUFFETT   Yes  he summed it up  In terms of the businesses we buy   and when we buy stocks we look at it as buying businesses  so they re very similar decisions   we try to know all or as many as we can know of the microeconomic factors  I like looking at the details of a business whether we buy it or not  I just find it interesting to study the species    MUNGER   Well there hardly could be anything more important that the microeconomics  that is business  Business and microeconomics are sort of the same term    12   Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want    Seems like too many people  public and private sector  are making a living slicing the pie rather than baking it    Figure out what you re good at and start helping other people with it  give it away  Pay it forward  Karma sort of works because people are very consistent  On a long enough timescale  you will attract what you project    If you are young  one of the best things you can do is build a brand around yourself   Yeah  this last set of quotes is a grab bag of ideas but there is a lot to grab in what he says  This post is already at 4 000 words  so I will let his words speak for themselves   Notes   Anatomy of

762,training-dataset/business/462.txt,business,Why Uber Won   Greylock PerspectivesWhy Uber Won  The Startup Steroid Era and the Use of Capital as a Performance Enhancing Drug  The start of 2016 marked the end of the steroid era of startups   the time between 2010 and 2015 when money was cheap and more plentiful  and used as a performance enhancing drug for company acceleration  No question  venture money has always been used to accelerate company building  But this was different  Cash was able to singlehandedly drive scale and growth  The zero interest rate environment created a generation of investors desperate for returns  and everyone   from angel investors to LPs   had money to put to work  The overhang of cash pushed the market pendulum to swing from fear to greed  and with it came unprecedented round sizes  valuations  and total capital raised  This level of venture money hadn t been seen since the 1999 tech bubble   Entrepreneurs look for an arb to build their business upon   a new ad platform like Facebook or Twitter  a platform shift like desktop to mobile  or some unique way to acquire users  For the past several years  money itself was that arb  especially for marketplaces  to rapidly scale their business     There are three ways for marketplaces to buy scale  they can buy growth  speed and or liquidity  For some  not all   it was a smart strategic move  And for Uber  money enabled them to win   Buying Growth  CAC   LTV   Both founders and investors value traction  Everyone wants to see strong customer acquisition  transaction volume  and geographic expansion  Growth can be a positive signal of a business  long term potential  which is why growth is a priority for every startup     Unfortunately  growth has become a proxy for success   even if it s  bad  growth  And yes  there is  bad  growth  If the cost of customer acquisition  CAC  is greater than the lifetime value  LTV   a startup can grow itself to death  Over the past few years  I have seen startups utilize cash to buy growth with the goal of optimizing the biggest top line possible  while neglecting core elements of their business like user experience and customer retention  A founder s job isn t growth at all costs   growth is the byproduct of an amazing user experience     When investors talk about growth  we re talking about sustainable growth  There are no shortcuts for long term sustainable business   companies should be built from the user experience out  not the top line in   Buying Speed  CAC   LTV   For marketplaces  speed provides a strong competitive advantage   it s not about being first to market  but rather first to liquidity  see my recent Harvard Business Review article  Network Effects Aren t Enough   Airbnb wasn t first to market  VRBO was  Uber wasn t first to market with UberX  Lyft and Sidecar were  In both of these cases  speed mattered   Uber and Airbnb executed at a much faster pace by buying users and hiring engineers     Many people confuse speed and growth  but the clear difference between the two is sustainability  If the CAC is less than the LTV of those customers  the growth is sustainable  Companies that buy speed are reaching their sustainable end state sooner while still focusing on key factors such as user experience  quality and customer retention  It s about the pace  However  simply buying growth takes the company in an unsustainable direction and completely off course  Growth from this perspective is about vanity   or worse  incompetence   Buying Liquidity  Network Value   Aggregate CAC   I ve often repeated the central goal of marketplaces  It s something of a mantra for me  liquidity isn t the most important thing  it s the only thing  Building a marketplace is similar to building two separate companies simultaneously with each being codependent on the other  The reality is that s really hard to achieve  The cold start problem of getting supply and demand to the same place at the same time for the same product or service is hard  Brutally hard  If you don t have enough buyers  the sellers won t come  If you don t have enough sellers  the buyers won t come  This is what kills most marketplaces   they don t just die of natural causes     As a result  marketplaces should be fixated on reaching initial liquidity quickly  There are many ways to achieve that and during this steroid era  money was a viable way to hack liquidity  Companies could just buy the supply  Heck  They could also buy the demand too  And if you buy enough supply and demand  the marketplace may be able to manhandle liquidity to a point that it could sustain itself without the artificial subsidy  The math is whether the network asset value at liquidity is worth more than the collective spend on the users  Not whether CAC is less than LTV     Does network value exceed aggregate user cost  This is a strategic question as much as it is a financial one   Uber Case Study  Uber is the canonical example of using money as a performance enhancing drug during the steroid era  Let s start with the record breaking facts  Uber raised  9 billion in equity and another  1 6 billion in debt over 15 rounds in a 6 year period  That is unprecedented for a private company     So what did Uber do with all its money  The strategy wasn t buying growth  speed or liquidity  Uber s strategy was to buy all of the above  At small dollars using money is a financial decision  At Uber s big dollars using money is a strategic decision  The company s use of money as performance enhancing drug was beautifully aggressive  It was offensive and defensive at the same time     If we rewind the clock to 2012  Lyft launched a peer to peer ridesharing service and Uber was a black car marketplace  Lyft and Sidecar s P2P taxis were a bigger idea in a bigger space  And like most marketplaces  it was a winner take all opportunity  or at least a winner take most  At the time  all three companies were only in SF and everyone was racing towards liquidity  with sights to have a right of first refusal on every other city in the country thereafter  Lyft had a big head start  but Uber was trailing right behind     Uber began to aggressively put its war chest to work to achieve liquidity as fast as possible  This meant enabling  5 minute pickups for riders and   25 hourly earnings for drivers  First  it guaranteed drivers hourly rates and spent money to acquire drivers  With drivers on the road  Uber focused on filling their cars through paid channels and incentivizing referrals  In a nutshell  the company subsidized fares and gave away free rides until there was enough demand and drivers could earn enough on their own  City by city  Uber implemented this playbook   buying drivers  buying passengers  subsidizing rides   to shave minutes off the pickup SLA and increase driver earnings  propelling Uber to liquidity   A rational competitor would have bought speed alone   buy as many users as you can as long as CAC is less than LTV  It s the prudent  but wrong  thing to do in this case  The problem is that this strategy only works if the other competitors do the same  And Uber didn t just buy users  they bought a network  It cost an order of magnitude more  but is worth infinitely more in a winner take all or winner take most space  It s the difference between finance thinking and system thinking     Uber used money as a weapon not as a tool     And it worked   Conclusion  The period of cheap capital and billion dollar checks has ended  In this capital constrained market  buying scale is no longer going to be a credible lever for the next generation of startups     Everyone talks about product market fit  but we need to expand the discussion  The trifecta is the right founder startup fit  product market fit  and startup scale up fit  Companies can no longer look to money as a performance enhancing drug for scale up  Even Uber couldn t be built the same way today     In this next era  growth will give way to profitability  Leveraging capital will give way to leveraging people and product  Focus will move from the balance sheet to the income statement  The center of gravity will shift from financial to strategic  Yes  the post steroid era will be harder but companies will be more sustainable and built upon a stronger foundation as founders will use creativity instead of money to solve problems,"[762 111 263 1 432 398 1034 752 1378 1075 359]"
774,training-dataset/business/1448.txt,business,Venture Capital Market Analysis   GV LibraryVenture Capital Market Analysis  In March of last year  our GV engineering team analyzed market data to assess whether or not the tech industry was experiencing a bubble  That question was being asked a lot at the time   less so now in light of some changes in the market  At that time  we uncovered ample evidence to argue both sides of the coin  Even with a great deal of number crunching  we didn t arrive at a definitive answer   The most we could verify is that if we were in a bubble  it was a very different bubble from the heady dotcom days in 2000  One important difference is that in 2000  individual investors in public equities bore the brunt of the dotcom bubble burst  If there s a bubble today  private capital investors and institutions likely stand to lose the most  That includes GV   Have things changed  More than a year later  our engineering team has repeated the exercise  looking at data from a variety of sources to answer this persistent question of whether or not we re in a bubble  The evidence still doesn t point to a definitive answer  Here s what we found   The bad news  fewer deals  fewer IPOs  dropping valuations   Fewer deals  Entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley talk anecdotally about a funding slowdown  Sure enough  the data show that venture capital dollars deployed in Q1 are down 11   and the number of deals dropped 5  compared with last year   Fewer IPOs  As we ve all seen  companies are waiting longer to go public  The first quarter of 2016 was the slowest for IPOs since 2011  and the average time between first funding and IPO is now eight years   Dropping Valuations  Later stage companies that may be contemplating IPO have seen their valuations start to fall  We ve seen data that suggest late stage valuations as a whole have dropped more than 43  since their peak at third quarter of last year   The good news  ample venture capital  sustained late stage deal making  and successful exits   Ample venture capital  Venture capital funds raised  13B in the first three months of 2016  the largest quarter in fifteen years and a full 59  higher than the same period last year  And it s worth noting that the National Venture Capital Association reports that the VC industry deployed more capital in 2015 than any year since 1995   Sustained late stage deals  Despite the valuation decline  later stage companies continue to raise additional rounds at an enthusiastic pace  In Q1 2016  investments in later stage rounds increased 10   representing 22  of the total deal volume   Profitable M A Exits  The IPO slowdown isn t necessarily a bad thing  either  In the first quarter of this year  there were 25  fewer M A exits quarter over quarter  but the deal value was double year over year  Exits through acquisitions seem to have taken the place of some IPOs  The Microsoft   LinkedIn news underscores the M A environment in the public markets   Bubble or not  risk taking startups remain important  So  is there a bubble  What is a reasonable conclusion from this less than conclusive data  Data more often lead to solid conclusions rather than predictions  which is what makes this difficult  I think a bubble that suddenly goes  pop  is less likely given the data from the last few quarters  but caution is still warranted  It s on my mind as I review potential investments  Like most venture investors  the companies we invest in stand a chance of failing  and unbridled success is rare  Spectacular failures  while unfortunate  are part of our reality   Regardless of the economic climate  the real job of any investor is to help entrepreneurs build meaningful companies and technologies  The best investors that we know don t try to time the market  and neither do the best entrepreneurs  We have to keep at it,"[774 1381 473 1378 1 1084 752 182 1033 243 545]"
777,training-dataset/business/766.txt,business,Why I Backed a 24 Year Old Trying to Assess Human PotentialWhy I Backed a 24 Year Old Trying to Assess Human Potential  Today Upfront Ventures is announcing that we ve backed Rebecca Kantar s startup Imbellus  a company designed to assess human potential and ultimately change the way we teach children  We led a  4 million investment along with Thrive Capital  GLG and Sound Ventures   The news blogs will cover the what  how and how much but I want to focus on the  why  and try to be instructive of what I think makes for a great A round startup   I speak a lot on college campuses and entrepreneur events and amongst the most common things I m asked to talk about are   What do VCs fund   How does one come up with the right idea to start a company   Do VCs really take risks on ground breaking ideas any longer or do they just fund businesses once there is proof of traction   I have standard answers to all of these questions at least as far as my personal funding preference are concerned   Hard Problems  I encourage entrepreneurs to try and tackle harder problems even if it makes fund raising more difficult and is less likely to succeed  As entrepreneurs many people are driven to solve their personal issues right in front of them  which leads a disproportionate number of founders to focus on  music  bars  restaurants  photos  etc   There is nothing wrong with focusing on these if you re passionate but know that you have a large set of competitors and industries in which it s hard to eke out a meaningful business   Mission Driven  I also am looking for founders that are on a personal mission to solve a big problem  I know that  mission driven  sounds nebulous or some convenient definition of anything we want to fund  But really it s something I look for  It s actually very easy to spot when a founder has decided to focus on a concept because he or she has  spotted an opening in the market  or building a derivative business that is  Uber for X  or  Airbnb for Y  or  Dropbox for Z    There s nothing wrong with these businesses but as a VC you tend to see 5 similar ideas all at the same time and knowing that it s going to just come down to who executes the best it s hard to pull the trigger on a A round until you have more data on who s winning   Building any business is hard  all consuming  frustrating and fraught with personal challenges  When a founder is  opportunity driven  it s too easy to quit at the first bump in the road  When a founder is  mission driven  you get the sense that he or she will do whatever it takes to make an impact in the market they serve and will keep persevering whatever the startup trends of the month   70  Team  30  Market  I also talk often about how much the team plays a critical role in my decision backing an A round company because so much changes as a company develops  Incumbents launch products  VCs throw cash at other competitors  team members quit  the economy dips   whatever  But only truly talented entrepreneurs show the grit required to respond rapidly to a changing environment  When you think about great companies that have survived market changes or platform changes you think about Facebook  Snapchat  Uber and the like and have to respect their great ability to constantly adapt   So Why Imbellus   When I first met with Rebecca Kantar I was stunned with the wide scope of her vision for building a company  Her mission was vast  She wanted to change the way we teach children in America  But she had such concrete plans for the 10  years that it would take to build towards her goal   She highlighted for me how we measure human potential today and it s based on the workforce that existed post WWII where teaching rote memorization of facts   math  reading comprehension  writing  basic science  etc    was sufficient for the jobs that existed in the industrial economy  We assessed skills by standardized tests designed to assess competency in this basic knowledge and this persisted in both the workplace interview environment as well as how we admit students into colleges   Inevitably as a society we began  teaching to the tests  and we design curricula around proficiency in these basic skills   But we of course now live in a  knowledge economy  that has to constantly adapt to changing market conditions  As leaders we intuitively know that while basic skills in math  science  reading   writing are necessary   they are not sufficient   As leaders we know that to succeed in today s economy we need people who possess abilities to deal with large volumes of information and cut through the clutter to get to what s important  We need leaders who can rigorously prioritize  We need leaders who can deal with a vague set of inputs and rationalize decision matrices  We need leaders who know how to accomplish feats through teamwork and collaboration  We need people who have emotional intelligence as well as actual fact based knowledge   Fundamentally the system feels broken  We educate and train and test for a set of skills designed to succeed in 1950   Imbellus is designing systems to assess how candidates analyze information  develop ideas  make decisions and solve problems that aren t based on rote memorization of facts  There aren t necessarily right or wrong answers and each company may index differently for how its employees need to score across various dimensions to succeed in that particular organization or job functions   The systems they are building are adaptive and computer generated so they can t be studied  memorized or gamed   It is a super early stage company so over time we ll reveal more about the methods  systems and types of assessments we re building   But what was clear to me in backing Rebecca was that I was getting behind somebody who has unbridled ambition  is mission driven and has a differentiated plan for how to solve a problem that we all know exists but feels intractable   Truly  in many ways  my concern was the inverse of normal business pitches  My only concern was whether we could limit Rebecca s scope of work enough to focus on shorter term  more tangible problems that could lead to a business before the mission  Luckily Rebecca herself is highly adaptive and was able to rigorously prioritize which problems to solve first  Invariably she would no doubt score very highly on her own assessment tests   It s rare that I feel so inspired by one entrepreneur and his or her vision  Rebecca is truly unique and I can t wait to see what she and her team at Imbellus deliver over the coming years  It obviously takes an entire team to build and execute against such an ambitious project  Wishing all of Team Imbellus much success in your journey,"[777 1087 432 545 1136 1044 1317 968 856 752 82]"
779,training-dataset/business/1152.txt,business,6 key similarities in our top performing companies   Patrick MeenanEach quarter we pull the Arthur Ventures team together for an all day offsite where we go through every company we ve funded in detail and rank them across a handful of categories to help inform where we want to deploy additional capital and better understand where we expect future returns to come from for our limited partners   Its always been a highlight of the quarter for me  but now its really getting fun because we are deep enough into the fund where we can clearly see companies breaking away from the pack and hopefully headed for special outcomes   Coming out of this last meeting I analyzed the traits of our top performers and noticed some similarities that were present in each of the companies  Not some of them  but every single one   I could write a separate post on each one of these  but I thought it d be fun to cover the highlights   Disclaimer before we hit the list   our investment focus at Arthur Ventures is 100  B2B Software   100  outside Silicon Valley   Product focused founder CEO  More specifically  a MANIACAL focus on product  In the first investment I led at AV  I was incredibly fortunate to co invest with a very successful partner at a world class firm and when I asked him about his best investments he said that his best performing companies were led by founder CEO s that had a maniacal focus on product  At the time I didn t really get it  but now I totally do  Over the last few years I ve observed product obsessed founders attract the highest levels of talent  have the ability to see where the market is going and possess deep long term beliefs that better position them to withstand short term struggles  Its has been a true x factor for the companies   Turning customers into a community  Turning your customers into brand evangelists is one thing  but creating a system by which customers directly benefit from interaction with each other to the point of near dependence on one another is a whole new level of competitive advantage  Some ways we ve seen this happen is through rich user forums  contribution of data back to the core product for continuous improvement  job boards for help with projects  user led meet ups and company led user conferences  This is the most powerful force in our top performers   Tripling down on the go to market that works  From a revenue standpoint  our top performers generally go from  1M    10M in ARR within 8 ish quarters post our initial investment  On that march  those companies tripled down on what got them to  1M ARR in the first place  If they were an inbound model  they didn t go heavy on outbound  If they were high price point  they didn t introduce freemium  You get the idea  The rebuttal of this is that what gets you to  10M ARR won t get you to  100M ARR  I totally agree and each of these businesses are now into new go to market channels  but they are doing so at a time where they have really good data on their own economics  an established brand and a lot of cash in the bank   Investing in recruiting early  We have observed a strong positive correlation between hiring internal recruiters early  first one around 15 20 employees  and revenue growth  One of our best companies has 4  recruiters on staff  It is a very high leverage point for the executive team early on  Having somebody do initial screens  be constantly present at community tech events and instill a strong recruiting onboarding process early on is incredibly valuable   Emotionally mature and present board members  Boards are always interesting  Multiply dozens of companies in a portfolio by 5 ish board members and you get a lot of people  You get a lot of people together and you see fascinating things  Good and bad  The founders of our top performers have done a really good job pulling together quality boards over the course of multiple rounds of financings  The key characteristics of these boards is that they have a very high level of active participation  i e   in person whenever possible with multiple interaction points between meetings  and emotional maturity  They don t try to run the founders  business for them or try to show everyone how smart they are  They provide a supportive environment that enables the founders to do their best work   Low Burn  Our top performers each burned materially less than  5M to get to  10M  in arr  They weren t hoarding cash at the expense of growth  They weren t being reserved people outside of Silicon Valley  They simply never lost the scrappiness that got them their first million in revenue   There is no silver bullet to building a great company and different approaches are needed for different products and markets  Self awareness of ones own unique situation is important  but hopefully you can pull a few nuggets from this to help on your journey   get in touch  Arthur Ventures  patrick

842,training-dataset/business/392.txt,business,How We Raised  700 000 For Our Startup without a productHow We Raised  700 000 For Our Startup without a product  Index  Intro The Options Our Process Pitch Deck 10 Things We Learnt About Investors Summary Resources  DISCLAIMER ALERT  This post is not intended to be a guide as to whether or not raising money is for your startup or when the right time is  Neither is it a definitive guide to raising capital  It is merely a recollection of the process taken by us while raising funds for our previous startup and what we learnt along the way   Saying that I would really advise that you think long and hard if you really need to raise money for your startup  I still think Chrys Chrysanthou from Notion Capital put it best when he said   Not every startup needs rocket fuel   As exciting and challenging fundraising can be for a startup founder  it is also a long and tiring process that will keep you away from your business at a time where it needs you most   You will need to be prepared to face a lot of rejection and making sure at the start that it is the right move for your startup will help you through the hard times   There are also many options to raise capital for your business and picking the right one depends on a lot of different components which I will not discuss here either  but will quickly run through a few of the options and let you know why we made our decision   THE OPTIONS  FFFs  The 3 Fs otherwise known as friends  fools   family is one of the most commonly used funding sources by startup founders for many reasons but probably the most common being that it is their only source of capital   It is known as friends  fools    family because most of the time it is friends and family that fund the startup and most turn out to be fools for investing at such an early stage with all the risks stacked up against them   Bank Loan  Probably the root of all evil  I have a big bias against institutional funding   A bank loan is not common practice for startup funding but there is always the option   In my opinion if you are able to clearly articulate your business to a bank manager to give you a loan with his limited startup knowledge you can convince any one of the alternate funding sources to fund you   Something I was told after building my first startup by a super successful entrepreneur was   The only way to make money is with other peoples money    You will spend more time and take higher risks than any sane person is willing to do while building your company  There is no point in putting yourself at more risk in the end by adding a financial component to it as well   You also do not need to own 100  of your company and having strong investors on board who have been through it all before can really put you at a big advantage over those who don t   Investing your own money is one thing but taking a loan to do so is a totally different ball game   Government Grants  Government grants should not be a source of funding you rely on as the arbitrary process takes way to long to come through than most startups lifespan   Government grants should be treated as a nice little bonus if and when they do come through and you should always weight the effort vs the return before making any applications   We were accepted for a grant in 2014 and turned it down in the end as the time it would take and the procedures required to receive the money would cost more in effort than we would receive in cash   We did not learn our lesson the first time and made a second application as we told ourselves the amount was much larger and would justify the effort   We were once again pre approved for the second round  Almost a year has gone by since the grants where meant to be distributed with still no sign of any news coming soon   So I repeat  grants are a bonus not a source of funding   Crowd Funding  Crowd funding can be an incredibly powerful source of funding if successful and seriously devastating if unsuccessful  I would advise crowd funding when you have a product that has proven product market fit and you need the additional capital to move into production   I would be weary if you have not reached product market fit as if you put out a campaign and are unsuccessful it sends a very bad signal to anyone else contemplating investing as the market has spoken for you   Kickstarter   Indiegogo are two great platforms if this is an option for your business   Equity Crowd Funding  Equity crowd funding is a practice growing in popularity that gives people the option to purchase small stakes of equity in startups listed through the various platforms  The upside to this is you not only get to raise money but you will also have a large amount of ambassadors for your company   Speaking with friends who have taken this route  one piece of advise they all mentioned was to make sure you have a lead investor before launching your campaign as having the majority of the round upfront helps a lot with investor confidence on the available platforms   Wefunder   Crowd Cube are two great platforms to look into if this is an option for your business   There are some issues involved with equity crowdfunding and would advise you do some in depth research before deciding to take this path   Angels  Angels are called angels for good reason as more often than not they are the only ones to come to the table with money and normally at the time startups need it most   Angel investors are high wealth individuals who  more often than not  are entrepreneurs themselves and having a good Angel on board can open a lot of doors for you moving forward   We had an option at the start to choose between a venture deal and raise more capital than we needed to at the start at a great valuation  or go with a group of Angels at a slightly lower valuation but only raise the capital we needed to get started   We chose the latter for 2 reasons   They were great guys and what really stuck out was the terms they would agree to  They did not ask for any share preferences and believed that the effort required on our behalf was equal to the capital they were going to invest so there was no need for special treatment  They were investing their own capital and would add a lot more value in the short term being directly vested in the company and having their combined hands on experience would help us grow and learn a lot faster   VCs  VCs are a very important part of the startup ecosystem but it is really important to understand when the right time to partner up with a VC is and for what reasons   If you are going to raise money from a VC you should only aim for the best because working with a top tier firm will be literally like adding rocket fuel to your startup  but to get a top tier firm to invest you  you yourself need to be top tier   There are many great firms out there that deal with startups at different stages such as Accel Partners  Kleiner Perkins   Greylock Partners to name a few but by far one of my favourite firms is First Round Capital for many reasons that we will hopefully get to discuss with them one day   When selecting a firm to target make sure you do your research to understand what stage startups they are looking for  what areas they invest in  and how they can really add value to your startup  Going in prepared knowing who   why will really give you a boost in confidence and make you come across as being prepared   Customers  I left this one for last as it is the ultimate source of funding without a doubt   If you are able to bootstrap long enough to reach product market fit and start generating enough income to grow organically you have nailed the fundraising process   At this stage you can raise money from anyone  anytime and on your own terms if you are looking for that extra fuel to drive huge growth   OUR PROCESS  Raising any sort of capital can be a time consuming process and the better prepared you are for the process the greater chance you have of being successful  Here are 10 steps we followed during our process   1  Be Specific  When we started out looking for investment one of the first things we did was sit together as a team and discuss what an ideal investor would look like and put together an investment proposal we all agreed on  We then decided on one person to focus on fundraising who would be the only one involved in negotiations   pitches  We would advise this as a best practice for a few reasons   Raising capital is extremely time consuming and distracting so by having one person focus it allows the rest of the team to give focus where its most important which is building the business  It avoids any miscommunication and stops any mixed messages being received by the investors  The pitch is constantly evolving and being perfected each time so the more you pitch the better it gets   2  Be Educated  Before you get started there are millions of resources  books  articles  videos  slide decks  and podcasts to help get you up to speed with how to raise venture capital   Make sure you know the process inside out from preparing your first deck to negotiating your first term sheet   You do not want to arrive at a meeting and get jumped with questions like   What is the LTV of your average user   What is your monthly churn   Is your valuation pre money or post money   3  Be Organised  Through the process we would advise looking into a CRM system to manage and remember all conversations you have with the potential investors   We setup a salesforce account for the process whereby all investors were listed and meetings documented to make sure we always remembered our last conversations and could recall previous conversations when following up   This also allowed us to keep track of the last deck shared with the investors and helped as a reminder of who needed to be updated on the latest progress   Having all the details in a central location also helped us to schedule a bi weekly investor update mail that was sent out firstly to update our investors and secondly to ask for any help where needed   The mail was broken into 3 sections   What we need help with Sales Product Developments  Being organised not only helped to keep our potential investors up to date but also allowed us to leverage the network we were building through the fundraising process   4  Be Social  Investors will do their due diligence when they are interested so make sure your team members profiles are updated on LinkedIn and have reference to your company   They will check you out and you do not want a social profile being out of date to raise concerns   Also make sure you have Crunchbase  AngelList  and f6s profiles setup as it is used a lot by Angels and VCs   We were approached by a couple of Angels through Angel co and even though they decided not to invest at the time  we were still able to make contact and expand our network   5  Be Simple  Investors see thousands of plans a year  they like it simple  More often than not entrepreneurs will go out of their way to try an include every detail they expect investors to be interested in  The problem with this is the more information you give the more room there is to find a reason why it is not a good investment proposal   Keeping it simple is an art that requires constant adaption to include only what is absolutely critical for an investor to make a decision   6  Be Prepared  Keeping it simple does not mean you should not be prepared  Putting together a pitch deck is just one part of the process   Once you have grabbed an investors attention they will want to see financial projections  You don t want to be scrounging around at the last minute trying to put the numbers together   A strong professional sign is having everything you are expected to have ready as and when a potential investor requests it   Saying that here are 5 things I would advise you to prepare   One pager Pitch Deck Investor Deck Business Plan Financial Projections  Send me a private message on twitter  andrewmichaelsa if you would like to see an example of each  I will be updating this post with downloadable templates   7  Be Eye Catching  Spend some time on the design as it is one part all investors appreciated about our team and pitch  The pitch deck is a high level view of your business and the first impression they get of your company   make it count   8  Be Connected  Investors know other investors  what might not be a good fit for one could be for another  Never leave a meeting without at least a referral to someone that may be interested   Referrals are key   Make LinkedIn your best friend   9  Be Polished  Once you have a list of investors you would like to go after start from the bottom up  Pitch the one s you would least like to invest in your company first  that way you have plenty of time to practise and mould your pitch before getting to those you would really like to join you and your team on the journey   10  Be Interesting  Investors are people too  They want to see passion  they enjoy hearing your story  Don t be afraid to tell them  let them know what journey they will be taken on when joining you  Take the investors on a journey when pitching to them and make sure by the end they want to be a part of your fairy tale   PITCH DECK SLIDES   The pitch deck material used in this section is 3 years old and merely for demonstration purposes   The pitch deck is the deck used when presenting to an audience  it should not be confused with the investor deck  Keeping it simple applies to the pitch deck more than anywhere else in the process of fundraising   Your job with the pitch and deck is only to create enough interest from an investor to want to book a follow up meeting  Most of the time you will be pitching to an audience with a limited amount of time and keeping this in mind will ensure success   More often than not I have seen pitches where the founders tried to cram as much info in the pitch as possible to try and answer investors questions but in the end turned out only to raise bigger ones and the unfortunate thing about pitching to an audience is you cannot answer every question on the spot  At that point you have most likely lost them forever   Keeping it simple allows for you to answer the essential questions and raise enough intrigue for investors to ask the harder questions in a more controlled environment where you are not under pressure and limited by time to provide a good answer   Below I have highlighted the points I believe go in a good deck  The deck should be seen as elastic in that it can expand and contract as needed for various events  You should have enough content for a 3 minute  5 minute  10 minute  and 15 minute pitch that can be adapted as needed but also be able to deliver a complete overview in a minute when the time calls for it   Having the slides ready below allows you to mould the pitch as necessary   The slides are in no specific order and you should move them around as you feel  The most important part is that the story should flow,"[842 1044 1317 545 856 512 29

844,training-dataset/business/314.txt,business,Convertible and SAFE Notes   AVCAngel seed rounds used to be done via priced equity securities  either common or preferred  Then  starting about ten years ago  we started to see convertible debt being used in the angel and seed rounds  By 2010 this was the norm and Paul Graham tweeted this in Aug 2010   Convertible notes have won  Every investment so far in this YC batch  and there have been a lot  has been done on a convertible note    Paul Graham   paulg  August 28  2010  Which led me to write this blog post here on AVC  I was not a fan of convertible notes then and I am not a fan of them now  USV has done a number of convertible and SAFE notes since then  I would guess that we have done a dozen or more of them in seed and angel rounds we have participated in  We are not opposed to convertible and SAFE notes and will not let the form of security the founder wants to use get between us and investing in a company that we like   But I continue to think that convertible and SAFE notes are not in the best interests of the founder s    Here is why   They defer the issue of valuation and  more importantly  dilution  until a later date  I think dilution is way too important of an issue to defer  for even a second  They obfuscate the amount of dilution the founder s  is taking  I think many investors actually like this  I do not  I believe a founding team should know exactly how much of the company they own at every second of the journey  Notes hide this from them  particularly the less sophisticated founders  They can build up  like a house of cards  on top of each other and then come crashing down on the founder s  at some point when a priced round actually happens  This is the worst thing about notes and doing more than one is almost always a problem in the making  They put the founder in the difficult position of promising an amount of ownership to an angel seed investor that they cannot actually deliver down the round when the notes convert  I cannot tell you how many angry pissed off angel investors I have had to talk off the ledge when we are leading a priced round and they see the cap table and they own a LOT less than they thought they did  And they blame the founder s  or us for it and it is honestly not anyone s fault other than the harebrained structure  notes  they used to finance their company   The Series A focused VC firms that often lead the first priced rounds get to see this nightmare fold out all the time  The company has been around for a few years and has financed itself along the way with all sorts of various notes at various caps  or no cap  and finally the whole fucking mess is resolved and nobody owns anywhere near as much as they had thought  Sometimes we get blamed for leading such a dilutive round  but I don t care so much about that  I care about the fact that we are allowing these young companies to finance themselves in a way that allows such a thing to happen   Here are some suggestions for the entire angel seed sector  founders  angel investors  seed investors  lawyers    Do priced equity rounds instead of notes  As I wrote seven years ago  the cost of doing a simple seed equity deal has come way down  It can easily be done for less than  5k in a few days and we do that quite often  The first convertible or SAFE note issued in a company should have a cap on the total amount of notes than can be issued  A number like  1mm or max  2mm sounds right to me  Don t do multiple rounds of notes with multiple caps  It always ends badly for everyone  including the founder  Founders should insist that their lawyers publish  to them and the angel seed investors  a  pro forma  cap table at the closing of the note that shows how much of the company each of them would own if the note converted immediately at different prices  This  pro forma  cap table should be updated each and every time another note is isssued  Most importantly  we cannot and should not continue to allow founders to issue notes to investors and not understand how much dilution they are taking on each time they do it  This is WRONG   Honestly  I wish the whole scourge of notes would go away and we could go back to the way things were done for the first twenty years I was in the venture capital business  I think it would be a better thing for everyone  But if we can t put the genie back in the bottle  we can at least bottle it up a bit better  Because it is causing a lot of problems for everyone,"[844 1186 175 545 470 29 1015 711 1317 1044 14]"
848,training-dataset/business/136.txt,business,Equity 101   Definitions  Distribution Methods  and Potential Issues Equity 101   Definitions  Distribution Methods  and Potential Issues   Dividing up equity is no simple task  Before you decide on how to allocate equity  its important to have a deep understanding of the dynamics and methods to distribute it  Too many founders botch this in the beginning and have their equity granted to them before an MVP even makes it to market  Only to be left with headaches and a messy cap table  I was lucky to have a couple of awesome mentors  help me along the way  Special thanks to Rick Nucci of Guru  in particular   This blog post consists of mostly definitions  Dividing up equity is another blog  for another day  I have cited all of my sources at the bottom  Enjoy   Stock Options Overview  Description  Grants employees the right to purchase equity  stock  in the company at a predetermined exercise price during a set time period in the future  Benefits  Provides an incentive for employees because options allow them to benefit from the increase in value of the company  Also provides some liquidity to the company upon exercise   A stock option is a right to buy stock in the future at a fixed price  i e   the fair market value of the stock on the grant date   Stock options are generally subject to satisfaction of vesting conditions  such as continued employment and or achievement of performance goals  before they may be exercised   Known as the employee pool or option pool   is the amount of the company that is reserved for future issuance to employees  A large option pool will make it less likely that a company will run out of available options   The size of the pool is taken into account in the valuation of the company  Larger the pool  the lower the pre money valuation  larger the post money valuation  Types of Stock Options  a   Warrant  the right for an investor to purchase a certain number of shares at a predefined price for a certain number of years  b   Restricted Stock Units  RSU s   Description  A grant of stock  which may be subject to forfeiture if certain future conditions  A grant of stock  which may be subject to forfeiture if certain future conditions Benefits  Provides an incentive for employees  and helps to retain employees if goals are not met  ex   continued accompanied by a forfeiture employment for a period of provision  Time or achievement of certain performance goals such as users  revenue  or net income   c   Equity Bonuses  Description  Performance bonuses paid in the form of equity instead of cash  Performance bonuses paid in the form of equity instead of cash Benefits  Provides an incentive for employees to meet performance goals while minimizing cash outlays by the company  d   Stock Purchase Plans  Description  Permits employees to purchase equity in the company at a discount to fair market value  Permits employees to purchase equity in the company at a discount to fair market value Benefits  Provides an incentive for employees by allowing them to participate in the growth of the company  while providing the company with some liquidity  e   Stock Appreciation Rights  SARs   Description  Entitles employees to receive cash or stock in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the company s equity on the date of exercise over the exercise price  which is typically equal to the fair value of the company s equity on the date of the grant   Entitles employees to receive cash or stock in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the company s equity on the date of exercise over the exercise price  which is typically equal to the fair value of the company s equity on the date of the grant  Benefits  Provides employees with the same financial gain as would a comparable stock option  without requiring a cash outlay upon exercise  Thus provides an incentive to employees and serves to retain them  If settled in cash  SARs will not give up any control of the company  f   Phantom Stock Units  Description  Entitles employees to receive cash or stock in an amount equal to the value of an equivalent number shares of stock  or appreciation in value of an equivalent number of shares of stock since the date that the units were awarded  upon the occurrence of one or more predetermined events  ex  A change in control of the company  retirement at or after age 65  etc    Entitles employees to receive cash or stock in an amount equal to the value of an equivalent number shares of stock  or

company  retirement at or after age 65  etc   Benefits  Similar to SARs  but realization of value is tied to the occurrence of an event  rather than the employee s unilateral election  g   Refresher Grants  Description  These are  forward dated grants    i e   you can give a high performing employee a refresher grant today where 1 3 of it starts vesting immediately and the other 2 3 starts vesting when their initial grant is fully vested  This guarantees them a low strike price and presumably a relatively large grant in a few years   These are  forward dated grants    i e   you can give

without giving all of the equity up front  I ve read Dustin Moskovitz at Asana does something like this  and I think it makes a lot of sense   Equity Compensation Distribution Models  By offering Equity Compensation  A private company   Provides an incentive for employees to perform in the best interest of the company Preserves capital by paying lower cash compensation Can compete for talent with larger companies by holding out the prospect of significant appreciation in the value of equity  A   Vesting   2 types  well 2 main types   1   Performance Vesting  conditions that require the recipient to accomplish certain business objectives  Performance conditions can have a variety of targets  such as to increase revenue  reduce costs  or develop new products  2   Service Vesting  Stock and options will vest over 4 years  25  to vest at the end of the first year  with the remaining 75  vesting on a monthly basis over the next 3 years  Some companies choose to do back weighted service vesting  For example  Snap Chat has their equity vest 10   20   30   and 40  over 4 years  respectively  There s some controversy over this structure  and can cause some animosity within a company if you re not careful   Unvested Stock   typically disappears when someone leaves the company  Equity doesn t get reallocated  rather it gets absorbed and everyone  VCs  stockholders  option holders  will benefit ratably from the increase in ownership   AKA Reverse Dilution  Unvested Employee Options   goes back into the option pool to be reissued to future employees  Major Component of Vesting   Defining what  if anything  happens to vesting schedules upon a merger or acquisition  Single trigger acceleration refers to the automatic accelerated vesting upon a merger  refers to the automatic accelerated vesting upon a merger Double trigger acceleration   refers to two events needing to take place before accelerated vesting can occur    refers to two events needing to take place before accelerated vesting can occur Specifically  an acquisition of YourCO combined with the employee in question being fired by the acquiring company   In VC funded deals   a double trigger is standard opposed to single trigger  Recommendation   use a balanced approach to acceleration  such as a double trigger with one year acceleration and recognize that this will often be negotiated during an acquisition   Vesting works for the founders and the VCs  By vesting each founder  there is a clear incentive to work your hardest and participate constructively to the team day in and day out   Same rule applies to employees  since equity is another form of compensation  vesting is the mechanism to ensure the equity is earned over time   B   Wealthfront   A Dynamic Model for Equity Distribution  Each year  you create a new option pool that addresses the following needs   New Hires  These grants are used to hire new employees at certain market levels  Promotion  These grants are intended to reward employees who have been promoted  Promotion grants should bring the recipient up to the level you would hire him or her at the new position today Outstanding Performance  These grants  made once each year  are only intended for your top 10  to 20  of employees who truly distinguished themselves on the basis of amazing accomplishments over the past year  Individual performance grants should represent 50  of what you would hire that person at for their position today  This pool should be reserved for non executives  Evergreen  These grants  which are appropriate for all employees  start at an employee s 2  year anniversary and continue every year thereafter  The idea is you don t want to wait until the employee s initial grant has been fully vested to give a new grant because by that time the employee will evaluate new opportunities  Annual evergreen grants should equal 25  of what that employee would receive if she were hired for her same position today  Giving 25  of the market rate for a position each year  rather than a lump sum grant that covers the next four years  will smooth out the vesting process so the employee never reaches a cliff  As I said before  cliffs cause people to raise their heads to consider alternatives and should be avoided at all costs   The Key  Consistent  Early Evergreen Grants  Most companies put considerable effort into the size of their equity grants for new hires   Fewer companies  especially young ones  put significant effort into thinking about follow on grants  If you tell your employees to  think like an owner   then you need to consistently align equity with their contribution to the success of the company   Evergreen grants are the most common area where technology startups fail to invest time until far too late in their development   Instead of an ad hoc process  the Wealthfront Equity Plan offers a transparent  consistent and fair program of equity grants that employees can build into their long term expectations  As a result  not only do you avoid cliffs  but you also tie both long term tenure and contribution to their ownership stake   The best part is that  as your company grows  you always grant stock in proportion to what is fair today rather than in proportion to their original grant   An Equity Plan that Works for Employers   Employees  Investors and employees make much more money by increasing the size of the pie rather than their share of the pie  The only reason not to implement the Wealthfront Equity Plan is greed  and greed seldom leads to a good outcome   One final observation about companies that successfully retain employees  They usually create a culture that treats options as something dear that aren t offered as an alternative to a cash bonus  They encourage employees to think about increasing the value of their options through accomplishment rather than asking for more upon completion of a task  It has been my experience that companies granting options for completion of milestones seldom build a culture that values equity   and therefore suffer greater turnover   A well designed equity allocation plan works for both the employer and the employees  The Wealthfront Equity Plan creates a tremendous incentive for people to stay at a company without costing the employer too much  That s the kind of win win to which we should all aspire   C   NCEO  Another Dynamic Model for Equity Distribution  1  Give out equity in smaller chunks more often  This will average out the lottery effects of changes in stock price while retaining flexibility to give equity to new people   2  Focus on giving away a percentage of growth targets  not a percentage of the company  Each year  set a goal  It may be sales  profits  or something else  If you meet it  then all the eligible employees would get an amount of equity that represents a percentage of the value of meeting that target  If you meet a stretch goal  you can give out more  This lets you as the owner focus on the value of your ownership  not the percentage  It gives the employees an annual goal to shoot for  making equity awards an achievement  not an entitlement  And if you don t meet the target  you don t have to dilute your ownership anyway   3  Give out ownership more broadly  Most technology companies give ownership to everyone  but so do many of the most admired U S  companies  like Southwest Airlines  Starbucks  and Whole Foods  companies that have been  game changers  in their industries   4  Working with the employees  figure out what amounts are needed to have a real impact on how they think about the company  If the company is small enough  you can do this on an individual basis  You might even ask employees to suggest a number and then work from there  Use surveys  if available  to set some reasonable parameters  but don t just aim to be at or above the median   5  Create a liquidity alternative other than sale or an IPO if neither of these events is highly likely in the near term  Somehow  a lot of people have the notion that this just can t be done  Of course it can  It s just a matter of finding the cash  easy for me to say   But imagine instead that you created an incentive plan that was a bonus instead of equity  People never seem to say  but how can I come up with the cash to pay the bonus   Think of equity compensation simply as a bonus based on stock value   Issues that may Arise  Legal Issues  The use of stock based compensation  however  must take into account a myriad of laws and requirements  including securities law considerations  such as registration issues   tax considerations  tax treatment and deduct ability   accounting considerations  expense charges  dilution  etc    corporate law considerations  fiduciary duty  conflict of interest  and investor relations  dilution  excessive compensation  option repricing    Corporate Laws  mostly for larger corporations  issuance of equity from company must be accepted from state laws   Securities Laws  must comply with state securities laws   No Sale  employee is not required to pay for equity in the company  bonus   Section 4 2  or Regulation D  exemption may be acquired if a limited number of employees are receiving equity who have a lot of knowledge about the company and knowledgeable about investments  Rule 701   the issuance of an equity award by a private company will be exempt from federal registration if all of the following are satisfied   The equity award is issued in connection with written equity compensation plan  The aggregate value of the equity awards during any consecutive 12 month period does not exceed the greatest of  a   1 000 000   b  15  of total assets  or  c  15  of outstanding amount of securities of the class being offered  The equity award is being issued to an employee  director  officer  or consultant or advisor  provided that the consultant or advisor is not being compensated for services in connection with the offer or sale of securities in a capital raising transaction  and they do not directly or indirectly promote or maintain a market for the issuer s securities  The recipient of the equity award is provided a copy of the equity compensation plan  Note that in the event the aggregate value of the stock awards during any consecutive 12 month period exceeds  5 000 000  there are additional disclosure requirements  e g   distributions of a summary of the plan  risk factors  and financial statements    Tax Issues  Ordinary income vs  Capital gains   equity amounts are taxed at normal rates  15 35   Incentive Stock Options   stock issuance  ISO s provide tax benefits for employees  however if ISO obtained will not be able to claim deductions attributed to rewards Alternative Minimum Tax   the gains that an employee sees from the stock rising in value from where it was originally issued will be subject to tax as income  Tricky law that affected way more people than congress envisioned  Section 83 b  elections   Section 83 b  of the Internal Revenue Code permits the founders to elect to accelerate the taxation of restricted stock  i e   stock subject to forfeiture  to the grant date  rather than the vesting date  As a result  the founder would pay ordinary income tax rates on the fair market value of the stock at the time of the grant  which presumably would be quite low   with any subsequent appreciation of the stock being taxed at capital gains tax rates upon its sale  Absent an 83 b  election  any subsequent appreciation of the stock would be subject to ordinary income tax rates at the time of the vesting   which could create a situation where the founder has significant tax liability  but no cash to pay it  It is therefore advisable  subject to consultation with tax counsel  for any founders receiving restricted stock to make an 83 b  election with the Internal Revenue Service  the  IRS    Such an election is made by filing the appropriate IRS form within 30 days after the grant purchase date  no exceptions applicable   Section 1202 preferential tax treatment for  Qualified Small Businesses   Only 50  of the gains on stock for small businesses that have been around for at least 5 years will be subject to income tax   benefits employee stockholders and investors alike   Employment Issues  A   Employer Concerns  Practical issues can arise in connection with issuing equity to employees  including   Control   Diluting current owners  which could reduce their control over management of the company   Minority security holders can create issues  Resale provisions should be put in place that would be triggered upon departure of an employee  Also  a nonvoting equity interest  such as a Class B nonvoting interest can be issues  Alternatively  stock appreciation rights  SARs  that are settled in cash can be awarded  which provide no rights to management but merely the right to cash  based on the appreciation in the value of the company  2  Resale Restrictions   Ensuring that the equity is not transferred to third parties who are not affiliated with the company or may not share the same views of the direction of the company   Each employee must enter into certain agreements with buy sell provisions that will require them to sell their equity back to the company under certain circumstances  These circumstances include   Termination of employment Sale of the company to a majority security holder  i e  Drag along rights  Insolvency of the employee  Etc   These transfer restrictions are also important to ensure compliance with securities laws  3  Valuation of Equity   Valuing a security that is not publicly traded   A company also needs to determine its fair market value in order to issue equity and or make purchases   Methods include   Periodic Determination by a valuation expert Book Value Formula based on a multiple of revenues  net income  or users  The method chosen depends on the industry  the preference of security holders and the amount of time and money they wish to spend  4  Funding Repurchases   Funding the company s repurchase of shares  Smaller companies may not have sufficient cash flow to fund repurchases by the company   This can be handled in several ways   Making payments over time above certain dollar amounts Using certain insurance vehicles if the repurchase occurs in connection with the death or disability of a security holder Placing Contractual limits on the dollar amount of repurchases that can be made in a year  absolute amount or   of net income  Company may also consider a line of credit to assist during seasonal periods when working capital may be low  B   Company Protections  There are a number of protection provisions that a company will want to consider including in their employee equity documentation   1   Repurchase Rights  With respect to restricted stock  private companies should always consider having repurchase rights for unvested as well as vested stock  Unvested stock  and vested stock in the event of a termination for cause  should always be subject to repurchase either at cost  or the lower of cost or fair market value  With respect to vested stock and stock issued upon exercise of vested options  some companies will retain a repurchase right at fair market value upon termination under all circumstances  other than a termination for cause  until the employer goes public  other companies only retain a repurchase right under more limited circumstances  such as voluntary termination of employment or bankruptcy  Companies should generally avoid repurchasing stock within six months of vesting  or exercise  in order to avoid adverse accounting treatment   These arrangements sometimes include a non compete claw back  under which shares are forfeited if a non competition provision is breached  although some state laws may restrict the ability to implement this non compete claw back   For a closely held company  however  the right to buy back shares from an employee who leaves on bad terms can avoid future conflicts and permits recycling of the equity to other employees who will build the company s future value  Buy back rights also provide companies with a useful tool to control the number of stockholders and avoid the need to track down former stockholders at the time of a sale   2   Right of First Refusal  As another means to ensure that a company s stock remains only in relatively few friendly hands  private companies often have a right of first refusal or first offer with respect to any proposed transfers by an employee  Generally  these provide that prior to transferring securities to an unaffiliated third party  an employee must first offer the securities for sale to the company issuer and or perhaps other shareholders of the company on the same terms as offered to the unaffiliated third party  Only after the employee has complied with the right of first refusal can the employee sell the stock to such a third party  Even if anemployer was not contemplating a right of first refusal  outside venture capital investors are likely to insist on these types of provisions   3   Drag Along Rights  Private companies should also consider having a so called  drag along  right  which generally provides that a holder of the company s stock will be contractually required to go along with major corporate transactions such as a sale of the company  regardless of the structure  so long as the holders of a stated percentage of the employer s stock is in favor of the deal  This will prevent individual employee shareholders from interfering with a major corporate transaction by  for example  voting against the deal or exercising dissenters  rights  Again  venture capital investors often insist on this type of provision   4   Founders Activities   Each of the founders shall devote 100 percent of his professional time to the Company  Any other professional activities will require approval of the Board of Directors    No win situation for the founder   If a founder is actually working on something else at the same time and it is not disclosed  the founder is violating the terms of the agreement in addition to breaching trust If you disclose the activities  you will reinforce the concern the VC has  C   Employment Issues  Most common lawsuits entrepreneurs face are on the receiving end of one of these employment issues   They are an unfortunate result of today s work context Everyone you hire should be an at will employee

856,training-dataset/business/1169.txt,business,How to Raise Money When You re Not From the  Startup World  Learn the rules and play the game   Even if that sounds obvious  you can t just absorb Fuck You Startup World and expect to raise money   If you somehow did  please hit me up because I d love to hear your story  But until then  no matter how good you are  you want to be sure that you package and present your business in the right way  Here are the questions and aspects you need to consider   Why are you trying to raise money   The first rule  and probably the most important  is to understand why are you trying to raise money  You can t expect to raise money from investors if you re looking to simply finance a marketing campaign or your new website  If you want to do that then you should probably call your bank to get a loan or use a crowdfunding platform  Investors expect from you a long term  big vision project and a game plan with successive  and successful  funding rounds  What they are looking for is a significant return on their investment  with the flexibility of pulling out  having multiplied their original amount   They are not really interest by yearly dividends  instead  they are looking for a dramatic growth of your company s valuation over the coming years  On our end  after building our pitch and vision for Unrated  we needed some help in validating our business model  and our projection over the next 18 months  Equidam is a company that offers an easy to use tool to determine the value of your business  but more than that  what they offer is a financial consulting service   it s very important to surround yourself with experts  You don t want to end up in front of an investor with a complicated spreadsheet filled with approximations   You have to accept that you can t be an expert in every aspect of the business  however that s not saying relinquish responsibilities  The point here is to make sure  at that early stage of your project  that you surround yourself with the right partners to help you on parts that you re not strong in yourself   Connect with Startup insiders  Even if I ve learned a lot online  nothing was more valuable than the conversations and feedback I got from actual member of this Startup world  And what I love about this is how open Startup entrepreneurs are in sharing their experiences  It s part of the  open source  culture and you can t really find that in other industries  I can t thank enough Quentin Lechemia  founder of SocialWall me and MyBandMarket for all the meetings and hours on Facetime with me reviewing my pitches and to give me all the tips to help grasp the Startup mindset  and CyrilPaglino  the founder of Tribe  funded by Sequoia Capital  for being brutaly honest and having taken the time to give me valuable feedback   despite his extremely busy schedule  What I value the most from this exercise is that all of them were not from  my world   So their critiques were different and refreshing to what I m used to  free from prejudice  and if I was able to impress them with my pitch  I knew I could move forward to the next step   Build your personal brand  Even if there are many opinions on what it takes to convince an investor to invest your business  most will agree that Angel Investors and VCs care a lot about the team  especially the founder s   In fact  most investors will tell you that the team is even more important to them than the business plan  because an A team with a B plan will always find a way to make it work  when a B team will probably bring an A plan down  So in our digital era  if you are not a TED speaker or already a well established entrepreneur  you need to build your own profile which could be tricky because again  knowing how to do this is not common knowledge  Personally  I ve always been more focused on building the company itself over my personal branding  because at the end of the day  that will be your legacy and not everybody likes being in the limelight   But if you plan to grow  you should put some effort into yourself and update your Linkedin profile  create an AngelList page  start your personal Twitter account so you can connect to other real people  it s very hard to do that through your company profile   Literally do everything you can to help establish yourself in the public eye  You don t have to be at Gary Vaynerchuk s level in few weeks  but it s not hard to start and again  don t forget that you are already engaged in a very long journey so allow yourself some time to grow   it comes in handy for the next rounds   Bring some serious KPI to the table  If you are not an innovative tech company  you need to show them what makes you special  VCs or Tech Investors understand tech businesses  So if you can t check this box or if you re still figure out why you ll need to hire a CTO then you should probably focus on generating real traction  And by traction I mean  traffic  followers on social network and revenue  Generating revenue should be your main focus because it s going to give you the freedom to say no and avoid inevitable failure by not being able to raise money for your business  Being an entrepreneur comes with responsibilities  and you want to protect your business before bringing anyone else on board  For Unrated  I spent the first months hustling day and night to secure deals so that we were in a profitable position before the end of the first year     Sean Lemoine  I ve seen many decks with numbers much lower than what we have down  yet have successfully raised millions of dollars  So I ve worked harder on the traction aspect because you want to show with your numbers that nobody can argue with your capability of making money and proven business model  Then you can use this as your answer to many of the standard feedback you ll probably hear  like  how do you make money   or  I don t understand the business model    Your team seems pretty small    What is your go to market    Your acquisition channels    All these questions are implicitly answered by the fact that if you already have the traffic and followers  you obviously know how to attract users  If you are able to create revenue with a small team then maybe that means that you don t really need to prove anything more on that  and if you already have clients for significant means of revenue then you don t really have to prove your business model or your acquisition channels  Be careful though  I m not saying that strong KPIs are the golden tickets to the Startup world  what I m explaining is that KPIs can help a lot  You ll still have to prove and explain your market size  scalability of your business  unique value proposition  etc   but this is the next step   Angels over VC s  At least for a Seed Round  First of all  good luck with getting a warm introduction with a VC  I mean  it s already a challenge getting an intro to an Angel Investor  let alone a Venture Capital at this point  Secondly  from what I learned  VCs at this point will probably not fully understand your project because it s not fully packaged  They want a  business model similar to AirBnb   but in reality  not every business model is that simple  but that doesn t means that there s no potential  Because you most likely won t have put together an A team of employees and advisors  I believe it s not worth trying out right now  Let s keep VCs on hold for the next round  What we are looking for right now is to build a syndicate of Angels that can represent you in the next round  and more importantly  understand your business  Raising money means huge growth acceleration  so at this time  you want to be sure that you ll be surrounded by the right people to help you in this process  Not only investors  but successful people from your industry that will help guide you   that s a solid leverage   Create your chance  What I consider to be the most challenging part of all this is the introduction part  When you are not from the Startup world  the question is  how do you successfully get a face to face meeting with potential investors  To be honest  I ve tried different tactics  but even if ideas and method about fund raising are all different  EVERYBODY is aligned on the fact that you need a personal introduction  I didn t work my ass off on pitches just to end up at a dead end  Instead  I started to write down a list of potential links from my network of people that could be connected in any way to investors   and don t expect here 1st or even 2nd degree connection  but who knows   as even if some of these meetings will not end up leading to the right introduction   at least this will give you the opportunity to perfect your pitch   Talk to people that understand the market  but are not your friends or potential clients  so any feedbacks will be objective   You can forget Linkedin and AngelList at this point  I mean  I tried to connect to many of my  5000 connection on Linkedin and even my 1st degree connection never answered my message  AngelList on the other hand is a great tool for the following stages after you ve filled out your company page with a list of your initial investors because you ll have a blank profile page otherwise  and the hardest part is convincing your first investors  which won t really work if there s nothing to go by   Don t cross the line   This is a very important  Even if you want to give it the maximum chance to make it  don t cross the line  At the end of day  what makes you special is who you are  Don t build an app or create an algorithm just to make you look like a Startup  because even if you can fake it for a short period of time  how will you deal with that for the rest of your life  And if you do last a while  you ll have to spend the money you raised on a product you didn t really wanted  or needed in the first place   This is not an ultimate guide or secret recipe  but I hope at least this helps you in some way to be prepare for your fundraising or find solace in knowing you re not alone in feeling like an outcast in the Startup world  If you have a similar experience  I d love to hear from you so feel free to contact by e mail or follow me on Twitter and Facebook  and if you are interested to hear more about Unrtd co you can always

932,training-dataset/business/1248.txt,business,Why your startup idea isn t big enough for some VCsWhy your startup idea isn t big enough for some VCs  The one  simple equation that every VC knows   Venture Capital functions with a power law where the majority of a fund s returns come from a small percentage of investments  Because of this  VCs need to know if a single investment can return the entire fund  As Bill Gurley famously said  Venture capital is not even a home run business  It s a grand slam business   This is where the Return The Fund  RTF  analysis comes into play   If we assume an exit distribution where over 60  of a fund s investments are 0 2x their money  with the remainder falling somewhere between 2 5x  a  unicorn  type 10x  outcome can put a venture fund into the desired 3x fund returns that puts them among the top performers in VC  Your 1 3 investments that  return the fund  and probably even more  the grand slam   is what will make or break you  while the other 2x 5x investments create additional alpha   The math for a RTF analysis is pretty simple   Fund Size     owned at exit   Minimum Viable Exit  To show how this works  let s take the hottest new deep learning  autonomous vehicle startup built on the blockchain  XY ai  as an example   XY ai is raising a  2M seed round at a  10M post money valuation  selling 20  of their company    VC Fund A is a  50M seed fund investing  1M   1M  10M valuation   10  ownership  In order to return the fund  XY ai must exit for  50  1     500M  You can take it a step further and assume that a  50M fund will most likely not be able to fill their pro rata across every subsequent round  thus their position could get diluted  we ll leave out the possibility of raising SPVs for pro rata   If we assume 20  dilution over the lifetime of the investment  then the real return the fund number is  625M   50M  08    So in order to pass the RTF analysis  VC Fund A must believe that XY ai will exit for at least  500M and more realistically  625M   Now let s look at a larger fund model   VC Fund B is a  250M seed   series A fund investing  1M in XY ai   Again   1M  10M valuation   10  ownership  In order to return the fund  VC Fund B has to believe that XY ai will exit for  2 5B   250M fund   10  ownership    More likely than not  a fund of this size is investing for future ownership as well  so assume that they will not fall below 10  ownership at any time  and if things progress favorably  will own somewhere on average of an additional 5  of the company when all is said and done  Still  VC Fund B has to believe that XY ai will exit for  1 66B   250M 15   in that increased ownership scenario   For more data of equity ownership at exits check out EquityZen s Path to IPO   As an investor  the difference between a company exiting for  500M vs   2 5B is not trivial  Less than 10  of all VC backed exits in 2016 were  500M   per CB Insights  Jet com was the only US based VC backed tech company to exit for over  2 5B   As a founder  this trickles down to thinking about their potential investor s philosophy  While some businesses are best built to exit in the hundreds of millions of dollars  larger funds could push startups through their natural inflection exit points in order to go for broke and hit a grand slam that is very unlikely to occur   While the RTF analysis is a good barometer for investments  it is indeed just one data point in the larger diligence process  It is a quick way to gut check ownership and investment size  and also allows investors to think about how they will need to build their positions over time  But while this thought process is generally useful  like all things in startups  there are outliers,"[932 654 812 470 1 182 545 398 1378 1238 943]"
943,training-dataset/business/828.txt,business,Why Raising Too Much Money Can Harm Your Startup   Both Sides of the TableWhy Raising Too Much Money Can Harm Your Startup  Amongst the most often asked questions I get from founders is   How much money should I raise    Reflexively founders want to raise as much money as they can because they figure it will give them more resources  better chances of competing and a longer runways before they have to do the often painful job of asking  yet again  for money  Every time you ask for money you re faced with the possible of feeling literally and figuratively like a failure   I understand this instinct for more capital and I have two very different personal experiences  In my first company we raised an A round of  16 5 million and in my second company we raised only  500 000 by choice   I have this  How much should I raise   conversation literally every week with startups  While there is no science to it  here is how I think through the issues with founders   1  You will spend what you raise in the same timeframes whether you raise  1 5 million or  4 million   It is a truism that with more capital you will hire people more quickly and spend more liberally whether it s on external contractors  PR firms  attending events  doing legal work  trademarks  patents  or whatever  You will build out features or expend to platforms   often before you have enough market feedback to warrant it   I was reminded of this yesterday watching my friend Justin Kan on Snapchat with this 10 second reminder   No matter how much you raise at your company you ll end up spending it in 12 24 months   I would probably amend it to say 12 18 months  People do what people do  You have money  you spend it  And there are consequences for spending too much money   I was always fond of saying about fund raising   When the hor d oeuvres tray is passed take two and put one in your pocket for later  Just don t take the whole tray   My analogy was that there are markets where it s relatively easier to raise capital and therefore you should take a little bit more but you should create a budget where you only spend 70  of what you raise on a pace of 18 months   But people never do  Justin is right   2  How much you raise determines valuation  I know it sounds crazy but at the earliest stages of a company your valuation often is determined by how much money you raise  There is a general guideline of how much investors want to own in order to invest in your company and the norm is 15 30  with the most common range 20 25  per early stage round   So the temptation would be to ask for  5 million because that implies a  20 million pre money valuation if you re able to only give away 20  or a  15 million pre money valuation of investors require 25    A  15 20 million valuation sounds better than an  8 million valuation  doesn t it  It seems almost silly to argue that it s better to have an  8 million valuation  But it s actually not that silly   For starters if you raise at an  8 million pre money valuation you re much more likely to raise  2 3 million and not  5 million  It s infinitely easier to raise  2 3m than  5m so you have a higher hit rate   3  The larger the round  the higher the price  the harder the next hurdle is to hit  But the bigger point I want to make is what happens when the coffers are depleted and you need more money  That is where over raising can be corrosive  What felt great when you raised it  5 million on  20 million now feels like a noose around your neck because raising at an up round of  8 10 million at a  40 50 million pre money valuation is stratospherically harder than raising at a  20 million valuation   Why   Because investors need to imagine making a minimum of 10x their invested capital and early stage investors are shooting for even higher multiples  The data suggests that the investors have a much easier time hitting a  100 200 million outcome than a  400 500 million outcome so it s easier to commit at lower prices   And if you raise the  5 on 20  and don t grow into your next round valuation you re stuck because venture investors HATE doing down rounds  They re corrosive in your relationship with the early VCs  the management teams will take them if they must but they end up feeling demotivated and in a venture world where great new deals are always coming around   why commit to somebody else s problem child   4  Constraints can spark creativity  Of course it never feels this way when you re the founder  but constraints can actually force creativity  Each person is the company has to personally do more vs  lead others doing work  Each person in the company has very short timeframes for making progress because you know proof points are critical in fund raising   And importantly   having limited resources forces you to make hard choices about what you re build and what you won t  It forces harder decisions about whom you ll hire and whom you ll delay  It forces you to negotiate harder on your office lease and take more frugal space  It forces you to keep salaries reasonable in a market where wage inflation has been the norm for years   I like talking about it as  holding one s feet to the fire  because it s an idiomatic way of reminding yourself of the obligation to constantly show progress   The two biggest measures for me of early stage company capabilities are   The ability to hire insanely talented people relatively quickly and without overpaying The ability to ship product early and often  in enterprise even shipping internal code or beta code matters   Mo  money  less fire   5  Some people can skip first base  My partner Greg Bettinelli has a sports metaphor that I ve become fond of which is  skipping first base   Internally at Upfront it s an entrepreneur who has enough of a proven track record that they can raise a  5 10 million A round based on their prior experiences   I like the skip first base metaphor because for some entrepreneurs they really deserve to start on second base   Maybe they worked much of their career running a startup in a sector and years later they want to go after that market again and they know from day 1 what they want to build  why and why it would work or fail   Second base entrepreneurs often know a large number of talented technology professionals and other executives who would gladly come back and work for him or her so team assembly is both quick and impactful   Second base entrepreneurs often have the credibility to raise follow on capital due to their historic track records and or their venture relationships so clearing the valuation bar on a subsequent round becomes easier   When we think about second base entrepreneurs we think in terms of being able to get to market without having to pitch 20 VCs and thus have all of your plans in the public market because we all know that word travels fast and we think in terms of being able to pull in a relatively senior team quickly   Often second time entrepreneurs don t want to leave the option of a safe exit at a smallish valuation on the table  They ve made a bit of money  they ve had a bit of success and they really want to go big or die trying   Out of 30 35 investments per fund we like to fund 5 6 second base entrepreneurs but mostly we believe in capital constraints as a positive force for both investor and founder   6  Choose wisely  The obvious consideration for you when you think about how much money to raise is also from whom you will raise the money   Some funds are geared towards a wide aperture of first checks but aren t big on following on to deals that don t attract follow ons  These funds have a view that  the market will speak  and if they don t support you then something must be wrong  There are some great funds that operate this way and I see some merits   Other funds have the view that they can form conviction of whether this still represents a great investment or now irrespective of what the market says  These types of firms may see your follow on financing as a chance to  buy up ownership    Most firms are somewhere in the middle  Knowing the style of the partnership will tell you something about what to expect if your cash starts to deplete and you re not yet ready for the next round  Importantly  within each firm different partners also have different styles and different levels of street cred in their respective firms to get deals done where the external market isn t yet ready to validate things   Knowing the style and reputation of the firm and of the partner may guide you towards the right number  If a firm is known for being supportive of initiatives that take longer  you may be willing to raise a little bit less up front   The  feet to the fire  mentality still holds even if the partnership is supportive  You re always better off if you can take the next round to market because it will create price pressure that helps you get a fair valuation internally if that s the route you take  If you don t have external interest you may still get an internal round done but probably at a lower price than you otherwise may have  So there s a healthy balance between investor needs and founder needs if you keep the pressure on yourself as though you don t have a supportive internal investor   Summary  There s no right answer  only trade offs  Most people opt for the  more money equals faster progress and less time fund raising  mentality  Often this is a mistake and one that isn t realized for 18 months until you next need to be in market   Fund raising isn t fun  But it s an important process  It s truly a marketplace where the validity of your idea is challenged and where your progress since your last time in market is measured  Marketplaces often provide the right incentives for people to perform  Having one s feet to the fire can be painful  it also can provide inspiration and creativity   And while having more money makes today easier  having a lower valuation makes tomorrow easier  So just consider the trade offs as you plot your journey,"[943 711 545 1 1044 1317 856 842 1238 29 398]"
953,training-dataset/business/1226.txt,business,Southeast Asia is One of the Best Places to Launch   Fund Your StartupIt looks like Silicon Valley may have a new rival in the worldwide startup scene  as Southeast Asia is quickly making a name for itself as a hub innovation and entrepreneurship  In fact  more and more investors are flocking to the region from around to capitalize on the growing entrepreneurial activity and local talent   Whether you re an aspiring entrepreneur who s local to the region or an experienced founder looking for international expansion  this post will show you why it s never been easier to launch and fund a startup in Southeast Asia   If you want to learn more about launching a company in Asia  RSVP for our upcoming webinar   How to Raise Funding for Your Startup in Asia    Why You Should Launch a Startup in Southeast Asia  Over the past several years  countries throughout Southeast Asia have been becoming more and more attractive to both local and foreign entrepreneurs with numerous benefits and resources that have proved invaluable to budding startups  In the Britethink article   Top 5 Reasons to Start Business in Southeast Asia   Bernald Ng outlines some of the advantages of launching a startup in Southeast Asia   1  Consumer Spending is Increasing  In most major regions  consumer spending represents a considerable part of the economy  with younger and working age customers making up a majority of the customer base  and therefore  a huge driver in economic growth  However  in recent years  several developed markets are experiencing a decrease in the size of this demographic  pointing to a reduction in overall consumer spending   However  Southeast Asian markets have a considerable population of younger and working age consumers  with a number that continues to grow  forecasting an economy that s conducive to startups that cater to the millennial population   2  The Savings Rates are Very Favorable  Because Southeast Asia is a developing market  it comes with a savings rate that is far more beneficial to consumers compared to that of more developed regions  To sum it up  the savings rate in emerging markets is 33 5   while the savings rate in developed markets is considerably lower  at 6 4    But how does this pay off for startups launching in Southeast Asia  With a more advantageous savings rate  more consumers will be more likely to buy luxury goods  like homes  cars  vacations  and more  meaning more opportunities for local startups   3  Local Governments are More Supportive of Startups  Because of a recent rise in support and funding from venture capitalists and government programs  Southeast Asia has given birth to plenty of unicorns  private companies that are valued at  1 billion or more   As expected  all of the hype surrounding the seemingly overnight success of local companies has only led to increased government support of startups   Several Southeast Asian governments have carried out startup centric initiatives  with Malaysia and Singapore leading the charge in creating an environment that s conducive to innovation and entrepreneurship with the creation of numerous incubators and accelerators   4  Southeast Asia Has the First Regulated Crowdfunding in Asia  Hong Kong is the financial center of Asia  yet has not made the move to legalize and regulate crowdfunding  The Malaysian Securities Commission  however  has approved six equity crowdfunding platforms to operate in Malaysia in June 2015  officially making Kuala Lumpur the center of equity crowdfunding in Southeast Asia   And as an added benefit  Eureeca com  a global equity crowdfunding platform with an operation license and office in London  Dubai  and Kuala Lumpur  has plans for expansion and funding to allow for Southeast Asian companies to expand throughout Europe  Asia and the MENA region   5  It s Easy to Do Business in Southeast Asia  Several Southeast Asian countries are noted for their ease of business for foreign entrepreneurs  For example  in 2016  World Bank ranked Singapore and Malaysia at number 1 and number 18 out of 189 countries  respectively  for ease of doing business   Southeast Asia is especially attractive to startups from English speaking countries because of high number of English proficient professionals in the region  Malaysia and Singapore are the only Asian countries to be ranked among top 15 in the world by the English Proficiency Index   Funding Activity is Rising  Another benefit of launching a startup in Southeast Asia  so important that it warrants its own section  is that it is easier than ever to raise funding for a startup in the region  and only continues to get easier   In the Tech in Asia article   Startup funding in Southeast Asia has broken the sound barrier  And that s for starters   Terence Lee discusses the rapid increase in overall startup funding in the region in recent years  with more and more companies raising  10 million  rounds each year   And it s not only increased funding from venture capitalists that are keeping the Southeast Asian startup ecosystem alive  as founders that launched successful companies several years ago are now investing their own time and money into the next batch of aspiring entrepreneurs   So with all of these promising startups raising more money than ever before  how can you and your company benefit from this increased funding activity in Southeast Asia  Below are some of the most popular ways that startups are getting capital   Venture Capital in Southeast Asia  Southeast Asia is home to a plethora of prestigious venture capital firms  both homegrown and those from other countries  and the number continues to rise  as seen in the Let s Talk Payments article   35 VC Firms Nurturing the

968,training-dataset/business/985.txt,business,How should investors combat their unconscious   How should investors combat their unconscious biases   Check out my side project Rejectionathon  discount code  EYFRIENDS   which helps founders get over their fear of rejection  The next one is on Jan 29  2017 in Mountain View     Yesterday  my employer 500 Startups organized a conference in LA called the Unity and Inclusion Summit  The focus was on diversity issues in startups and one of the central topics was on unconscious biases in the industry     This is a really important issue that often gets shoved under the rug  I can t begin to tell you how many times I hear people say stuff like   Oh  well  I don t see a problem   Silicon Valley is a meritocracy   Or  This issue is a gender issue   it doesn t apply to me    But this could not be further from the truth  And  everyone should be concerned  For me  one of the big problems that I have with the current startup ecosystem is that I don t think there are a lot of founders who get a fair shot to demonstrate their merit when it comes to fundraising  That s a priority issue that needs to be solved  Unconscious biases in how investors assess founders can be tied to gender or race  but it extends much further than that  For example  there are investors who have unconscious biases against introverts or non pedigreed founders  Or if you have a certain kind of foreign accent  you should be concerned that there are a lot of investors who are unconsciously  or consciously  biased against you   The problem is that it s hard to know to what extent there s a lack of meritocracy  If a female founder gets dinged  is it because she didn t get a fair shake  In this industry  frankly speaking  most founders are not going to be able to raise money  The odds of raising are against ALL founders  Period  So  if you get dinged  you can t say  Oh it s because I m a woman  I wasn t able to raise    Investor Paige Craig of Arena Ventures eloquently theorized yesterday at the conference that part of the reason we have this big problem with unconscious biases in this industry is that we don t have a framework to assess founders  And I think this is spot on  Assessing founders is highly subjective  I hear my peer investors  both at and outside 500 Startups  say things like   Oh  that founder is so sharp   or  That founder has a lot of hustle   Do you really know after meeting someone for just a handful of times if someone is smart or has hustle  You don t really know the person  What you do know is that you are taking your life s experiences and trying to superimpose what you ve learned about other past people you ve met who seem similar and apply them to the founder at hand   As Paige mentions  the way to really tackle unconscious biases when making investment decisions on founders is to have an objective framework  Here s mine  and it s a work in progress   I value these 3 traits of founders  tenacity  learnability  and speed to accomplish things   There are  of course  other characteristics that are very important to me in choosing the people I do business with more generally speaking  including honesty   integrity  etc  But for founders  I focus most on these 3 traits as a starting point    It s important for me to be able to point to enough facts for each of these characteristics   Speed to accomplish things  One of the best indicators that I ve found to measure speed is if a founder says he she will do something by a specific constrained time and then does it  and repeats this pattern consistently   then he she is excellent in this realm   For example  if I meet with a founder this week  and he says that he will do xyz by next week  then when next week rolls around  I might check in and see if he has done it  If this pattern is consistently positive for several weeks on end  you ve got someone really special here   I realize this sounds ludicrous  because shouldn t everyone be able to follow through with what he she says he she will be able to  As it turns out  most founders I meet are not able to  Something comes up and task xyz doesn t get done  Or maybe the founder is not good with time management or scoping out reasonable goals within short periods of time  Or maybe there is conflict with the team  and the founder isn t able to work with people well  Or maybe the founder is distracted by speaking at too many conferences  It doesn t matter the reason a founder doesn t accomplish his her micro goal  But the ability to quickly accomplish tasks that you set out to do is a very objective criteria that I like to use when I assess founders   So when we say things like   Oh she is such a hustler   we really should say things like   Oh this person sent out 2000 outbound emails last week  And 1000 the week before    Learnability  This is a tough criteria to assess objectively   To a certain extent  this criteria is tied to coachability  If I give a founder a piece of feedback this week  has he she changed something about himself herself or the business by next week  At the same time  I don t believe that my advice is right or best  and in fact  it s a founder s job to assess whether or not to take advice  So if a founder doesn t take my advice  I m ok with that   that isn t a negative mark per se  But if a founder does take my advice  and implements it quickly  that s an indicator that he she can learn quickly   Other ways I assess this is when hear from a founder about a time he she taught himself herself a new skill  Or in hearing about how he she accomplished his her goals  I hear about what he she had to learn along the way   So instead of saying   This founder is smart   which is subjective  I prefer to say   This founder learns quickly because he she taught himself herself enough Python last week to throw up this script to scrape ABC   Starting a company requires founders to constantly learn new things quickly  so this is a really important criteria for me   Learnability is very different from being  smart   People who go to say Ivy League schools have proven they have strong skills in being able to take tests and do well in them  But these skills are very different from the ones you need to run a company  So they don t transfer over at all  The best founders are constantly learning new skills they don t already have and are mastering them quickly   Tenacity  The last criteria is also really hard to assess objectively  If a founder has a story about how he she powered through a difficult situation   cancer   a rough childhood   etc  then that s a plus  But most people don t have a crazy adversity story  so this one is tough  Often  I just end up not having any data points on this criterion   These are the three characteristics that I look at most when I evaluate founding teams and try to come up with facts to support a case for each point  This isn t always easy  but the more facts there are under each of these  the easier it is for me to assess a founder   Of course  founder assessments alone  do not make an investment decision  Other criteria are just as important and in some cases more important   market  whether a company will be able to raise further  existing traction   product market fit  etc  But given that assessing a founding team is a really critical component to evaluating an early stage investment opportunity  being objective here is really important  At the moment  my framework for this is ok  but it can definitely be improved  so I m open to any thoughts   suggestions   feedback   Fundraising is a nebulous process that I aim to make more transparent  To learn more secrets and tips  subscribe to my newsletter,"[968 1044 1317 161 14 545 856 108 777 1087

1015,training-dataset/business/349.txt,business,How To Secure A Lead InvestorYou ve created an amazing founding team  you ve built a brilliant product that has been gaining a lot of traction  and now you re looking to expand your company  How do you continue to build your business  By searching for a lead investor in your next funding round   The lead investor is the first step in the process that makes the rest of the process take flight  The primary responsibilities of a lead investor is to invest  advise and attract other sources of capital for your business  There are so many financial opportunities with a lead investor on board  so searching for one will definitely provide a lot of value to your company   Below is a list of ways to identify a lead investor  build a relationship  close the deal  and everything in between for your next funding round   What Is A Lead Investor   A lead investor is a company s principal capital provider  Lead investors play a much more critical role than that of any other investor  Regardless of what round  whether that be the angel round  venture round or hedge fund  finding a lead investor can be invaluable to a company   There are certainly many paths towards acquiring funding  but having a lead investor can prove to be beneficial  For instance  when a lead investor takes the lead in representing a funding round  they can influence follower investors to get on board and thus increase the value of the funding round  Beyond finance  lead investors can also offer invaluable advice towards the company s growth   How To Identify A Lead Investor  The key to identifying prospects to become the lead investor in your round  is to do your homework  Most founders think that just any investor has the potential to help lead their funding round  This couldn t be further from the truth  The key is to find an investor that has some type of experience in your industry  so they will quickly understand the problem that you are solving  and your solution  Investors that fit the descriptions below will more likely be willing to meet with you to discuss your company   Has either previously invested in  founded  or been an early employee at a company in your industry  Invests in companies at your stage  whether it is seed stage  series A or beyond  If you make the mistake of pursuing investors that have no experience in your industry  you will create a much harder road for yourself  because they will not have the natural sense of empathy for your company and industry  In the post titled  How to Find a Lead Investor   by Nitin Pachisia  who is a founding partner of Unshackled  gives a great example of this advice in action saying   If you pitch an investor who has no experience in the retail industry  and try to explain a point of sale solution to them  they are just not going to relate to it as much as an investor who has experience in retail or one who has 5 or 6 portfolio companies in the industry    3 Qualities Lead Investors Must Have  According to Adeo Ressi  below are the three qualities that you should look for in a potential lead investor   Interest in Your Segment  I shy away from investments that are designed in order to get a return via an exit or an acquisition  Look for investors that want you to become a great  long lasting  sustainable business  Ensure they truly believe in your mission     Neal Sales Griffin  Starter League  from  Choosing An Investor  5 tips from 5 Entrepreneurs   Financial Resources  A lot of entrepreneurs will ask questions around how big the angel s fund is  how we make decisions  and if we ve invested in this space before  Also  are you investing right now  I like those kinds of questions because it shows the entrepreneur is sizing me up and is interested in finding the right fit  not just someone to write a check    David Cohen  TechStars  from How to Find the Right Investor for Your Business    Time and Risk Readiness  You have to do an intense background check on your investors before you ink a commitment  I can t stress this enough  You also have to exactly understand their time investment  A lot of young startups make the mistake of thinking their investors will be more involved than they are  so you have to really understand what you re walking into     Rob Fulton  Exponential Black  from  9 Things You Should Avoid in a Potential Investor   These qualities limit the number of people  but guarantee you a great lead investor for your company  And remember  before finding a lead investor you are going to speak to at least 50 potential investors  20 of which may be interested in your company  and 10 of which may actually invest  You may get lucky if you secure a lead investor before speaking to 50 prospective benefactors  but those are rare cases   Do Not Get Blacklisted From Lead Investors  If you are looking for funding but do not have your pitch or company in good shape  you will be blacklisted  When you get a  no  from an investor  that  no  is forever  The average investor sees dozens  if not hundreds of deals a month  There are some cases in which investors may look at your company again  but don t count on it  Also  if you make a bad impression with one investor  there s a good chance that they will pass the word along to fellow investors  which will hurt your chances for potential meetings with others   Glen Hellman  a serial entrepreneur and angel investor  provided a list of the offenses that will put you on the investor blacklist in his post   Have You Been Blacklisted By Investors     Following up with an email telling the investor they don t get it or they re idiots   Pulling the rug out from under the investor because they aren t moving fast enough or some other bogus reason   Associating with and depending on sleazy  untrustworthy advisors   Not being coachable  Never admitting you don t know  that you made a mistake or arguing too stridently with a closed mind   Coming into the process with the na ve inflexible belief that the money raiser sets the deal price and terms   How To Build A Relationship With An Investor  Adeo Ressi  Founder and CEO of the Founder Institute tells us some simple truths about lead investors   A lead investor should believe in you to death    If you can convince them to believe in you then the benefits that you will reap are priceless  They will play an extremely important role in the success of your company   Your lead investor will start the movement for your company  They will become your social proof for other investors    This is not to mention that they are usually the largest investor in your funding  Your job is to start a relationship with that investor and eventually convert them to be a lead  This starts with you making the first contact and reaching out to them  During this process  Ressi lays out a very important rule that he urges you to follow   Never ask for something  unless you think that you re going to get a yes  A no is forever  Once they say no  you ll never get funding from them    This means that you have to build a relationship with the investor before you ever ask them for funding  Here is the chain of interactions that Ressi  who s raised venture capital for multiple companies and now has his own VC fund  suggests that you have with an investor that you d like to invest in your company  Notice that asking for funding doesn t come until the 6th step   1  Meet  2  Invite to Coffee  3  Send a New Update  4  Meet at an Event  5  Dinner Invite  6  Funding Ask  7  News Update  Here is Ressi s graph  that corresponds with your chances of getting a  Yes  walking through these steps   Getting A Yes From Your Lead Investor  Remember to only ask for funding once you ve had 5 6 interactions with your potential lead investor and are at least 50  sure that they ll say yes  If they say  Maybe  or  I ll think about it   then you ll want to send them a news update after they give you this response  If you don t get a  Yes   from them after sending a news update than your chances of getting them to say  Yes  in the future will steadily decrease   But while pursuing a lead investor  it s important to not forget that your main goal with each meeting is to get another meeting until you feel confident enough that you can ask them for money  Once you are ready to ask them  you ll want to phrase the question in a way that won t directly elicit a  Yes  or  No  response  Here s are some examples of types of questions that you can ask    Would you be interested in helping the company grow by leading the next round of financing      Would you be interested in advising us on how to grow     Would you be interested in advising the company on how to grow  and leading our round of financing    Turn Your Lead Investor Into An Advisor  Finding the right advisor can be tricky  If your startup is at the stage of looking for funding  chances are you already have a few  But a good tactic for getting great advice from someone invested in you is granting your lead investor an advisor position  As you ve already learned  your lead investor s expertise and connections should be in your market domain  therefore having them as an advisor would be greatly beneficial for you and your company  Adeo Ressi says   You re going to have to compensate the lead    Compensation provides additional motivation for your lead to follow through with their investment and be vigilant in helping you  Compensating the lead with an Advisor Position can be distributed through  Advisory Shares   Typically these shares will be  5  to 2 5  in options vested over 2 years   and can be tailored to the input of your advisor and the stage of your company  And there is an easy  lawyerless way to carry this agreement out   The Founder Institute has created what we call the Founder  Advisor Standard Template or  FAST   The FAST document offers a way to quickly allow founders and advisors to work collaboratively without going through the cumbersome legal drafting often required to divide shares  Now compensating your advisor is as easy as checking a few boxes and signing the dotted line  This way everyone wins   Furthermore  when securing your lead  you should control the terms of the agreement through an convertible equity round  This way not only do you propose the terms sheet and draft the final agreement  but you also don t leave the burden  and cost  of drafting the documents needed to the lead investor  You also avoid the downsides of convertible debt   Build Buzz For Your Funding Round  Before you close a deal with a lead investor  make sure that you create a balancing act between developing buzz and maintaining or increasing your growth metrics   Plan a series of company internal milestones and send monthly updates in a newsletter  Organize at least one public announcement before close and secure partnerships for external validation   Ensure that metrics are moving upward  Though you may be hustling during this period of time  try not to neglect the business  Even if you obtain a lead and plan to close in two to three months  an investor won t hesitate to pull out if your metrics tank  Make sure you re hustling to close  creating buzz  getting press  and growing your metrics all at the same time to decrease chances of failure   Closing The Deal For Your Funding Round  In closing the deal  you are going to need a strong lawyer or company counsel engaged to help with setting the terms and valuation for your company  Make sure the terms are agreed upon  meeting the minimum closing amount  minimum investment amount  and closing date   Here are some examples   Minimum closing amount   We won t close this angel round with less than  250 000    Minimum investment amount   The minimum to invest in the round is  20 000    Initial closing date   We re going to target the closing date on November 13th    The  maximum amount with a rolling close  is less necessary these days  because it s easy to hurt your business by setting a max with investors  Adeo claims   If you have a three million dollar cap and you re raising one million dollars in convertible equity  then suddenly you raise two million dollars because more people have come in  you just sold 40  of your company in your angel round  There is no hope you ll ever own your business again and have lost control of your company    Be careful when thinking about a max amount  If two million dollars worth of interest rolls in  throw away the team sheet  find a new lead  and restructure the terms  Adeo adds that   in an ideal world  you have 5 to 6 investors and you may get up to 10  I recommend convertible equity right now  pretty much universally  because the equity deals are harder to do    Raising money is definitely a hard task and there are no shortcuts  but if implemented successfully it can be very rewarding  With fundraising outlets like AngelList and Gust to help source investors for your next funding round  remember that the core of securing an investment is building relationships  Always be patient and prepared with your pitch  so that when an opportunity presents itself  you ll be sure to secure your lead investor   Like this article,"[1015 33 1211 842 545 1044 1317 29 856 1 1238]"

1034,training-dataset/business/1293.txt,business,Exponential growth devours and corrupts   Signal v  NoiseExponential growth devours and corrupts  There is no higher God in Silicon Valley than growth  No sacrifice too big for its craving altar  As long as you keep your curve exponential  all your sins will be forgotten at the exit   It s through this exponential lens that eating the world becomes not just a motto for software at large  but a mission for every aspiring unicorn and their business model   Going viral  suddenly takes on a shockingly honest and surprisingly literal meaning   The goal of the virus is to spread as fast as it can and corrupt as many other cells as possible  How on earth did such a debauched zest become the highest calling for a whole generation of entrepreneurs   Through systemic incentives  that s how  And no incentive is currently stronger than that of THE POTENTIAL   It used to be that successful  upcoming companies would show a prudent mix of present day profits and future prospects  but such a mix is now considered old fashioned and best forgotten  Now it s all potential  all the time   This trend didn t start yesterday  We can t blame the current crop for soil spoiled five harvests ago  No  this singular focus on potential  forsaking all present day considerations  was cultivated by some of our current giants   It s companies like Salesforce that have shown just how long you can live on potential alone  Just how large and sprawling you can become without ever bothering to show much if any profits  There s a decade and more s proof that growing like a virus  gobbling up other businesses to cling to the exponential  is how you can be  successful    There s always more potential  Always another idea or domain that can be devoured  But this is also the straight path to devolution and its distortions  Bright ideas boiled free of all that is good and left dry as bones   Angry Bird s shake down screen  Have you tried Angry Birds lately  It s a swamp of dark patterns  All extractive logic meant to trick you into another in app payment  It s the perfect example of what happens when product managers have to squeeze ever more growth out of ever less fertile lands to hit their targets year after year   It s straight out of the split pea soup parable  What if we removed just three peas  Nobody can tell  The factory can save a few million  The executives who pushed that idea can get their yearly bonus  No harm  no foul  But nothing ever stops at the quarterly win  There are four quarters to a year  Forty to a decade  Every one of them has to produce  exceed  and beat EXPECTATIONS   Because the core assumption is that growth is always good  growth is always unlimited  and if you re not growing you re dying  Swim or sink  no wading   It s the banality of moral decline  No one person sits down and imagines that Angry Birds of 2009 becomes the Angry Birds of 2017  A fun  novel game turned into a trashy slot machine  Nobody is proud of work like that  But it happens  One pea at a time  Until the split pea soup has no more peas   We cannot expect otherwise  It takes superhuman strength to resist the compound expectations of quarterly growth targets linked to an exponential moon shot  The list of comic book heroes capable of such a task is so short that we ve already deified the few  like Steve Jobs  who held the line   And who knows where he would have gone given another decade or two    Remember  Don t be evil   Google s iconoclastic corporate slogan that slowly but surely accumulated so many caveats and exceptions that it needed as much legalese as a terms of service agreement  Principles are no match for the long term corrosion of market realities and expectations  The levies will break  the good intentions will flood   But back to the incentives  It s not just those infused by venture capital timelines and return requirements  but also the likes of tax incentives favoring capital gains over income   What sucker wants to earn  10 million year at a 52 5  tax rate when you can get away with hundreds of millions in one take at just 15   Nobody  that s who   It s hard to argue that boards  founders  and their financiers aren t just doing exactly what the incentives are coaxing them to do   Which is why growth is now everything and residual value is nothing  In fact  the latter can be outright harmful to the former  When you re being priced on the hopes and dreams of potential  reality can be a dangerous and undesired competitor  Best just to appeal to the exponential curve and let the imagination roam free  An epic capital gains score awaits   Given how pervasive this worship of potential and growth has become  it wasn t surprising that when we pruned the product portfolio at 37signals a few years back  and left only Basecamp  the reaction was mostly one of incredulity  or even anger  Either we were cutting businesses that were devoid of financial merit  or they had merit  and we were thus per definition crazy to let them die  Crazy to turn down growth  To summarize the ethos of the comments sections back then  If something is creating revenue  it s your solemn duty to keep milking and pumping until it s done  Extract every cent  then move on to the next mining effort   The fancy word for that is fiduciary duty  To grow as fast as inhumanely possible is not just a goal  but a responsibility  A moral obligation to THE MARKET  And the theory goes  the market is all of us   So you re actually serving your community  All that is bad is good again once you change the tint of your glasses  If you sense something rotten  you just need a new prescription  Now you ll see as clear as fog that this is ACTUALLY ABOUT ETHICS IN BUSINESS   The true puppeteer behind this homogenization of startup aspirations is diversification theory  Decisions are not driven by what s good for a single company  its employees  and its customers  No  it s what s good for the basket   These baskets are known as venture capital funds  That s the pipeline through which virtually all recent tech companies that have reached the public markets were sent  It s a gladiatorial arena with the explicit goal that if enough businesses in the basket aren t failing  the fund isn t trying hard enough  Not dreaming big enough  Be more outrageous  Be more crazy   It s a hyper evolutionary process that rewards the most extractive  most addictive  most viral strain from the cohort  The key measurement is ENGAGEMENT  Who cares about the virtue of the endeavor  as long as your product is maximally addictive   Engagement  of course  is not a new pursuit  It s just the latest euphemism for what we used to call capturing eyeballs  But I guess that was a bit too blunt and honest to survive the sanitization of the industry  The collective ecosystem learns and adapts at an incredible pace  including how best to position its image to incite the least amount of skepticism  They have better words now to hide the same scheme in plain sight  The normalization of questionable motives in the public perception is key to enabling the next iteration to proceed without obstacle   And iterate they do  At a furious pace  Every new fund is competing against the survivors of the last one and the more purpose bred contenders of the current one  It s what makes looking at the values and principles of today so fascinating and frightening  If this is where things stand in 2016  what does 2020 look like  2024  2030  The mutations will continue  And they absolutely will not stop until every last one of us has been through the funnel and converted to a servile consumer as ingredients in the sludge of growth   Innovation  risk  and morals are being packaged with ever greater efficiency through startup accelerators that take the raw ingredients  preferably pattern matched look alikes of Zuckerberg  and turn them into securitized batches of startups  Whole tranches of burgeoning businesses packaged into Spring and Fall cohorts  This packaging has turned out to be a great model for the packagers  Many small sums spent on 7  of ownership  If you package enough entrepreneurial product  your actuary tables will line up beautifully   And you get to indoctrinate these seeds with the values and practices of the most successful viral strains from last season  Genetically modified  cloned  and inoculated startup founders with all the right bits  flipped to ensure the greatest chance of the biggest yield   But what is a conscientious objector to do  Time waits for no one  and only the Luddites think that their home too won t one day soon be configured with BUY NOW buttons for all the beloved BRANDS  Controlled by a friendly bot in the cloud that learns all your habits  preferences and titillations one command at a time  Data mining has also successfully been rebranded to the more palatable Machine Learning  Who wants to stop anyone  human or machine  from learning  What are you  the digital taliban   So too with the startups themselves   If we don t  we re leaving money on the table     Has there ever been a more gluttonous justification for guiltless business practices   Uber drones haggling drivers stuck in traffic in Mexico  Could it be that perfecting the most viral superbug   until the final strain is discovered that really DOES devour the whole world   isn t what the whole startup community should be focused on  What if we opened our eyes to non exponential startups and the needs they may have instead   But again  don t you know businesses are valued on future potential  not present reality  Yes I do  And that s my objection  Surely a mix is prudent  but the spectrum has gotten out of whack  To the point where the present is entirely discounted by the lure of the future  And the past  what it took to get where we are  is either ignored or forgiven  Mistakes may have been made  but tomorrow is an entirely new day  divorced from any of the days that went before it  It s a constant cycle of absolution combined with a community induced amnesia to past transgressions  It s just more efficient that way   Technology isn t the only industry that grapples and struggles with growth  so we can learn from studying others suffering the same pressures  Take the drug business  It costs staggering sums to develop a new mass market drug  and it s a risky endeavor  so we reward the explorers with a patent monopoly when they strike gold  But it s not a permanent one  There s a time limit  and after that generics distribute the gains of progress widely without the yoke of a profit maximization goal   What if we thought about how we could apply some of that to the world of software  How can we turn more of the Twitters and Facebooks and Googles into generics  What shifts in underlying technology and cost do we need to hit to make it feasible to run something like Twitter on Wikipedia s budget  and fund it by donations rather than ads   What if the next Big Idea looked more like email and less like the walled gardens of today   We ve made this transition at the infrastructural level  to some extent  Technological and algorithmic advances from closed source software have been turned into generics via open source  With spectacular commercial success  no less  As one boat sinks  a thousand new ones float  One software company or product s death is easier to celebrate  rather than mourn  when you know the intellectual organs are giving life to ten new ones   Additionally  startup culture used to focus a lot on the personal risk of the founders and early employees  To a nauseating degree  yes  This heroism was the justification for all the spoils there were to come  These days  there s a lot less talk of existential risk because there s a lot less of it  There s so much money floating around that for many founders  the risk is mostly gone  At least in the financial sense  if not in the moral and time opportunity sense  Failure is celebrated to such a degree in part because the system needs to recycle able bodies as quickly as it can to keep the overall system growing  Spent three years on a startup that didn t work out  No sweat  bro  Here s a hug and a reboot and a new bag of money to try again  You re here just in time for my next fund   Now some of that is clearly good  Less extreme risk means  at least in theory  greater access for more people to participate in the startup lottery  But it also has some clear downsides of detachment  If this go is just one of many  if you can always just hit restart  then you re probably not as concerned about this specific go around  So what if we step over the line a little here  ITS THE HUSTLE  BABY  And besides  if we miss  no biggie   Maybe it s time we rediscover some personal liability  Limited  yes  none  no  Complete detachment from the consequences of your choices isn t producing the kind of responsibility the world so dearly needs   But that s hard  Of course it s hard  Not the least because this whole adventure is so heavily medicated with foosball tables  game rooms  and bean bags of all colors  As many distractions as possible from having to consider the true nature of what we re doing  What s that about the rising automatron class  Sorry  I m late for a nerf battle on the star deck  Later   Yeah  the automatron class  People treated as literal cogs in transportation and delivery machines  Complete with machine like tolerance specifications for quality  Dip below a 4 7  You re in trouble  No explanations  No room for a bad day or a bad week because the bills were mounting  No room for humanity  no room for frailty  Just put on your happy face and Have A Great Day   The Black Mirror episode  Nosedive  shows the logical conclusion of this ratings world  I ve been as guilty of this as anyone  When I first discovered Uber  I was ecstatic  So much less human friction  No yucky money changing hands  Just in and out  Headphones on and let s go  The less I had to deal with the humanity of drivers  the better  Or so I thought   But not all that is easy is better  Friction is interaction  Human psyches rubbing against each other  And in this friction less society we wonder how on earth someone could vote Brexit or Trump  It wouldn t be such a mystery if we didn t do all we could to isolate ourselves from the world   Yet we go along with the euphemisms and fantasies  Oh no  no  These people aren t cogs  they re independent business owners  Able to set their own hours  Like whether they want to drive for 60 or 80 a week to make ends meet  Aren t we liberating   And I think that s the truly insidious part of the tech lords solution to everything  This fantasy that they will be greeted as liberators  When the new boss is really a lot like the old boss  except the big stick is replaced with the big algorithm  Depersonalizing all punishment but doling it out just the same  Maybe the old cabbie boss was an asshole  but at least that asshole had a face  Someone you could yell at  Have you tried yelling at an algorithm or a customer rating average   It s just another mass scale exploitation project  And by exploitation  I mean that less in a shackles and bone soup sense   although there s a good discussion to have around that too   but more in a pennies for you  billions for me kind of way  Enormous wealth being extracted from people living subsistence lives  But rather than being seen as modern sweatshops  we are all cheering this on as unadulterated progress  Anyone who s in opposition to this exploitive process is a crank  as Michael Foley would say  Any community that may have reservations about how this is happening is a shit hole   Now that doesn t mean that there aren t all sorts of vested  crony interests in keeping innovation at bay  Surely there are  But there s more than that  There are a whole host of legitimate reasons why we have government regulations around housing and transportation  Inconveniences to the march of Instacart and Uber to turn everyone into a temporary gig worker   This exploitation isn t just for the workers of the Uber or the neighbors of Airbnb  It s also all of us through the algorthimization of news at the House of Facebook s behest  More engagement  More rage  more fake news  all resulting in more hours spent  more eyeballs fixated  more clicks and taps made   And this new world order is being driven by a tiny cabal of monopolies  So commercial dissent is near impossible  Do you want to be the weirdo without a Facebook account  The uncool stooge for staying at a motel or taking an old school cab  Of course not  You re hip  you re with it  Everything worth doing is in an app   So it remains mostly our fault  Our choice  our dollars  Every purchase a vote for an ever more dysfunctional future  We will spend our way into the abyss   If nothing changes  we ll continue to vest the tech titans and their lords with economic monopolies that grant them undue power  They re too big to be conscientious   Don t be evil  is a slogan for an upstart  not a conglomerate  You simply can t distribute such noble a moral codex across endless divisions  all with their own P Ls   And don t fall for the soothing charity by the extractive victors either  That charade is as old as time  It s the process by which ruthless tech lords seek to rebrand themselves into noble benefactors for the good of society  By giving back some of their spoils as they see fit  Kings of plenty doling out gifts and mercy  Don t buy it  And I don t mean that in the sense that  say  Bill Gates hasn t done good with his fortune  But that society isn t better off when we have to rely on magnanimous tech lords to solve its ills by decree   Incumbent power centers will not go quietly into the night  though  Excuses will be aplenty  because unlike the robber barons of old  they re not going to defend themselves with water canons and lock outs  It ll be cold war skirmishes fighting for fake moral high grounds  Natural monopolies  Network effects   Because competition is for the little people  Pitting one individual contractor against another in a race to the bottom  Hoarding all the bargaining power at the top  Disparaging any attempts against those at the bottom to organize with unions or otherwise  Ragging on that as  untapped energy    When you accept this entire picture  it s not so hard to understand why some people are starting to freak out  I m freaking out  This is worth freaking out about   As Douglas Rushkoff says  we need a new operating system for startups  The current one will keep producing the same extractive and monopolistic empires we ve gotten so far  No  what we need is a new crop of companies that are institutionally comfortable with leaving money on the table  Leaving growth on the table  Leaving some conveniences and some progress on the board  in order to lead the world into a better direction   The solution isn t simple  but we re in dire need of a strong counter culture  some mass infusion of the 1960s spirit  To offer realistic  ethical alternatives to the exponential growth logic  Ones that ll benefit not just a gilded few  but all of us  The future literally depends on it,"[1034 752 856 545 432 14 111 1317 1044 1 286]"
1044,training-dataset/business/382.txt,business,The Fundraising Wisdom That Helped Our Founders Raise  18B in Follow On CapitalTwo years ago  our team at First Round  led by Partner Bill Trenchard and VP Platform Brett Berson  began to quietly build out a program to help our founders navigate the choppy waters of follow on fundraising  Long had we observed founders caught off guard by what was needed to raise their Series A after having a relatively easy time at the seed stage  only further exacerbated by an influx of seed funding in the market   All together  we have immense knowledge in fundraising that we ve accrued witnessing our companies raise over 1 000 rounds and  18 billion in follow on funding  It s possible for startup founders to know more about almost every facet of company building  but fundraising is one area where we ll always be able to offer more experience   Realizing how well positioned we were to help  we built a program called Pitch Assist   a four to six week bootcamp for our startups that are getting ready to raise follow on capital  At the end of the program  they emerge with a well designed deck  a strong narrative  and a clear strategy for how to approach the fundraising process  Unlike normal fundraising advice  Pitch Assist is an immersive program where we advise  build presentations and rehearse side by side with First Round founders  Trenchard  in particular  has experience on both sides of the table  having started and fundraised for 5 companies before joining the firm   What follows is an inside look at how we run the Pitch Assist program  and what startups everywhere can apply from what we ve learned helping create fundraising pitches and processes for over 10 years   FIRST  FIX YOUR TIMELINE  Given the cyclical nature of tech and venture  there are distinctly good and bad times to raise capital   Avoid August  the second half of November and December  when many venture firms slow down  The year end holidays and summer dog days are dead zones for fundraising  so why set yourself for an uphill process  July can be slow  too  You can finish your fundraising process in late July   just don t start it then   says Trenchard   For businesses that have seasonality  it s prudent to coordinate your growth and fundraising cycles   If you re in education  think about the start of the school year  September is probably a great time to raise because your performance in August is ticking up  and by September and October you re on on a roll   says Berson   Keep in mind that you re having these fundraising conversations over a period of about 4 to 12 weeks  As you re fundraising  more data s coming in  The ideal is that data   whether it be user growth or new enterprise customers   is looking good and you re on the upswing  There are few better things than updating your deck with new data that s pointing in the right direction    TARGET THE RIGHT INVESTORS  A partner at a Series A or Series B firm will typically lead no more than one to three deals per year  a cadence that makes choosing a company to invest in a significant and emotional decision  Founders who understand this dynamic are a step ahead   Use the 10 90 rule   The reality   and difficulty   with fundraising advice is that it s not all created equal   There are two approaches  one for the the top 10  of startups and one for the other 90    says Trenchard   For the vast majority of early stage companies  raising capital is a slower  relationship building exercise  It may not be a competitive process  so your goal should be to to get one or two partners to fall in love with what you re doing  Running an aggressive  get every meeting lined up approach won t work as well for the 90  as it will for the top 10  of startups    In either scenario  it s critical that your fundraising process be organized and methodical  Never run an ad hoc process or be half heartedly fundraising  As a founder  you should either be fundraising or not   and if you are  it should be done with great intention   Of course  applying the 10 90 rule comes with its share of challenges   For many there s a Lake Wobegon effect  everyone thinks that they re in the top 10  until they realize they re not   says Trenchard   Given that there are two different fundraising tacks  this can have a major impact on your ability to raise capital    According to Berson  here are common traps that might trick you into thinking you re in the top 10  of companies raising funds   Inbound investor interest   It s understandable to think that momentum is building when an investor says   I want to get together  or  I m really interested   but set your expectations after you ve first met  regardless of the name on the door  This is especially true if the inbound is from a non partner   Just because a number of investors reach out pre Series A doesn t mean a deal is going to get done   Feedback from existing investors   By and large  it s not in your current investors  best interest to undercut your business  Unless they practice radical candor  they may sanitize their advice and mostly give encouraging feedback  Or they might just not know what s a fundable company and what isn t in the current market    One data point comparisons   It s tempting but invalid to do one off benchmarking  Saying that you re better than your friend  who just raised 20 on 80 for her consumer business  doesn t work  Taking a single  convenient reference point from your network doesn t mean that the same financing  valuation and success are at play  Fundraising is an incredibly nuanced process and it s often difficult to look at a few other data points and understand what they mean for your own prospects    Closing a seed round was easy   If a founder had several investors interested in a seed round or raised funds quickly  it s easy to believe that history will repeat itself  The reality is that nearly every variable may have changed  the market  the investors  the capital available   even the founder s ability  A Series A fundraise is a different mountain to summit    But we re a market leader   Doing better than your competitors doesn t make you a shoo in for the investor or round size of your choice  If you re the leader of a niche industry  you may have less growth potential than the smallest player in a massive or rapidly growing market  People often forget the  market  part of market share    Vet the portfolio  pick by partner   Founders that put in the time to research firms and their partners have an outsized advantage  Here s how Trenchard and Berson have seen savvy founders do it   Scan their portfolio for similar business models   Most companies will just look within their industry to see if an investor is a match  Yet  it s important to look for a similar business model regardless of sector  If you re selling to SMBs and many of the firm s companies do as well  the VC could be a good fit   says Trenchard   Take note of competitors   Of course  you want to be mindful of competitors in a VC s portfolio   adds Berson   If there s a similar business model in your industry niche  flag it and have that conversation upfront with the investor at the very first meeting  That s both because you don t want to invest time if the deal will be marked competitive and you want to take care of sensitive information that may benefit a competitor  Go in eyes wide open    Choose a partner  not a firm   Yes  there are great firms out there  but they re led by people  So  who at those firms makes it the right name for you   asks Trenchard   I really do believe it s partner over firm  The two are important   and it s great if you can get both   but let your primary hunt be for the right partner     Know each partner s perch in the firm   Track record and tenure make a significant difference within the hierarchy of a VC partnership  So it s not only about an investor s individual conviction for a company  but the juice the partner has in the firm  Take their number of months on the job and investment count as a benchmark   says Berson  Trenchard adds   Take note of the exceptions  I d suggest looking at track record across careers  not just a firm   If this is one of the first few investments a given partner has made  it doesn t mean a deal won t get done  but it certainly raises the bar significantly   Show the type of restraint that comes from research   Do you know what impresses VCs  It s when a founder says   We ve thought about this and we re not talking to everyone and their brother  We know you can make a difference in our business given your background in X and how you ve helped Y startup with its challenges  We ve done references on you    says Trenchard   Wow  Why do only 0 1  of founders do this  Take the step to call founders of startups that are backed by your target investor and do this before you re far along in your process    Choose your sherpa wisely   Your first contact not only  owns  the deal within the firm  but also likely determines how you ll be guided through it  So if you get introduced to a junior partner or associate  you may have a more circuitous fundraising experience depending on their internal influence   says Berson   You don t need to only talk to the founder of the firm or managing partner  but do choose your entry point wisely  That means not only who overlaps with your expertise  but also who is influential internally  Ask other founders who have recently worked with the firm for an honest appraisal of their first contact who ushered them through the process   Once you get an introduction to a given person at a firm  it s almost impossible to transition the opportunity to a different partner   GENERATE SCARCITY  Having been at both sides of fundraising  Trenchard understands that scarcity is a powerful tool  If the outcome of the 10 90 rule is to create the right relationships  generating scarcity is about prioritizing them  Founders should seek to create a feeling of demand without overloading themselves  as well as manufacture  fear of missing out  without making it a bad experience  Scarcity is your friend in fundraising  Here s how to hit that mark with precision   Fundraise like a surfer   plan to take on investors in sets   As a rule of thumb  speak to no more than five firms at a given time  regardless of where you fall according to the 10 90 rule  There s nothing worse than the perception of an over shopped deal  as VCs relish having the inside scoop on an exciting company  Group investors in batches to better evaluate and select them  like a surfer scanning sets of waves that move toward the shore  Here s how   Create groups reflecting a variety of priorities   Say you have a dozen partners at firms who might make a good fit  Don t group all your top choices in the first set of five  Pick two or three of your highly ranked VCs and round out the set with lower priority firms  Even if you ve rehearsed your pitch  you ll continue to refine it  so diversify your schedule to account for that learning curve  It s going to take some time in market to perfect the actual pitch  That said  don t leave all your top picks until the end as they ll be very out of sync with your process if in a later set  It s a balancing act    Structure the meeting days right next to each other   You want to kick off with each set of VCs with the same information simultaneously  If interested  VCs will generally move at a similar pace  If they aren t  they ll get back to you sporadically   some immediately  others weeks later   which is why you need to actively manage them in or out of your cohort  Ultimately  you want to maximize not only the number of offers  but also the chance they ll come to you in a similar time period    Use the back burner sparingly   If you have a lower priority firm that gives you a term sheet  you can hold them for a week to 10 days  but don t try to start a new process from scratch with a new set of firms at that point  It s enough of a challenge to coordinate a handful of fundraising conversations simultaneously  let alone ones in different stages of development  This is another reason to take time to sort  group and sequence your target investors at the beginning    Check your pulse   Especially for first time founders  it s easy to get tied to a fundraising strategy and timeline  Start the process with your first five VCs and regroup after the first week  If half of the first set are engaged  stick to just that set  If four of the five drop out quickly  prepare for the long haul and launch your second set   Given it s in an investor s best interest to give you a long drawn out  maybe   you need to read between the lines to understand their interest  Look for things like how fast they respond to you and find time for subsequent meetings  how quickly they give you clear next steps and ask them early for a clear understanding of their internal process   Before starting  nail the narrative with your seed investors   Before you jump into meetings with firms  make sure your seed and angel investors are working from the same storyline   Take it as a given that potential Series A investors will backchannel and reference check with your current backers  They ll notice if there s a well known Series A firm in your seed round that s not leading the next round   says Berson   The truth is there may be many reasons why that happened  so be sure to have a common message that all your seed investors rally behind  It s a big liability to just assume everyone will tell the same story    Make it a race   As a rule of thumb  schedule your first meeting three weeks prior to your first set of pitches  Your goal now is to get partners to hit the sweet spot between FOMO and disinterest  You want to get a term sheet  which is not only the promise of greater resources and runway  but a lever to generate a race dynamic    It s all about getting to a term sheet  Without one  you don t have leverage   says Berson   Ideally it s from your top choice investor for your ideal terms  but if it s not  a term sheet can be your negotiation tool  Without that  everyone is waiting around the hoop  A term sheet can create both a sense of scarcity and urgency    There has been some especially sound advice around creating a race dynamic  especially from Ted Wang of Fenwick   West  Here s his framework   The Horse Race  Think of this as the traditional way of fundraising  You ve got your list of targeted firms to fund your company  You identify who in your network can make the introductions and you release them at the same time  like horses out of a starting gate   The Rabbit  This approach is more like a dog race  where a mechanical rabbit is released and the canines chase it around the track  In this analogy  the rabbit is a VC with whom you met a week before the typical horse race  described above  commences  This can help move VCs along more rapidly   The Heads Up  This method refers to a poker scenario in which only two players are left in a hand after the others have folded  Two players  the VC and founder  are sizing each other up on what the company is worth  Wang elaborates with a sample exchange   Founder   I m going to go out and raise money  I really like you and want you to invest  If you make me a great offer  I will take it   VC   Tell me what you think is a good offer   Founder   If I m dumb enough to do that  you should not invest in my company  I m not going to negotiate against myself    In the  Heads Up  scenario  Trenchard strongly recommends that founders give a range for their desired investment amount  not a specific number   By declaring a figure  VCs can easily back into your implied pre money valuation by assuming 20  ownership  So always give a range  such as  5 to  7 million or  10 to 12 million   he says   There s one exception   and that s when the stars begin to align  ideal terms from the ideal investor  If there s an investor that clearly emerges as your first pick  reach out to say   Listen  you re my top choice  I m talking to others  but that ll stop now if we can do a deal at these terms  If you don t like them  I d still want to work with you  but will wait until the market tells me where the terms are before making a final decision   This is the rare case where it s okay to make a specific ask    THE WINS AND SINS OF PITCHING  Do not underestimate the impact of an outstanding deck and delivery  As Toytalk Co founder and CEO Oren Jacob says   A pitch is a live performance  You have to know it so well that it seems spontaneous   At the same time  don t let how you re pitching undermine what you re pitching   Here are key lessons and tactical tips that Trenchard and Berson have extracted from the thousands of pitches they ve heard and countless hours working side by side with First Round founders during Pitch Assist   Systematically surface all of the burning questions investors may have and that you have to know how to answer   At First Round  prior to the first Pitch Assist meeting  we have founders fill out a questionnaire to catch us up on what s happened in the business since the last time they raised  often their seed round   what makes their narrative unique  and what they believe their most compelling arguments are to date   Then  based on what the First Round point partner knows about the company and the Pitch Assist team s independent research  we develop between 10 and 15  Burning Questions  that we believe need to be answered before a startup should speak to investors  Today  we work with incredible designer Chris Laughlin and content expert Jared Bloom to run this process   Answers to these questions become a solid basis for the flow of the story itself  Our team actually prints out all of the questions  posts them on a whiteboard and then  as the brain trust talks through answers  takes notes next to each paper  These lend momentum  movement and energy to the responses  It also encourages concise  clear  relevant answers based on data    Most people  when they build a pitch  sit down in front of a blank PowerPoint document and start at the beginning  without really knowing where to go next   says Bloom   They spend an hour on it here and there until three weeks have gone by and they ve only taken one stab at the order of information  Our goal is to accelerate the consideration of all these options so you know you re ending up with the strongest way forward  and you always know what comes next    Any founding team can recreate this exercise themselves before they ever open PowerPoint or Keynote up    This is perhaps the most critical step  because it gets the founder thinking about their company from the perspective of an investor  Having that empathy with your audience is really critical if you re going to take them on a journey and get them excited about your idea   The critical thing is that the questions brainstorm is a safe space for founders to externalize any anxieties  sticking points  uncertainties and dreads  That way they can be answered systematically  You also want part of your braintrust coming up with questions to be uninitiated to the company and provide fresh eyes  As a founder  you might think something is obvious when it s anything but for the average person  And even though investors are often well versed in an industry or technology  your best bet is to describe what you re doing in a way that anyone can understand   While it s critical that your burning questions are generated by taking a hard look at your company and the market  here are some examples for inspiration   Your churn rate is high  why is that and what are you doing about it   The space you operate in is fiercely competitive  how are you going to differentiate and win   You have poor unit economics  how are you going to build a robust business   You seem to have a very long sales cycle  How does that impact the capital needs of the business and deal size   What is your ideal customer profile and how does that tie into your go to market strategy   Can you build a big business by only focusing on the long tail   If you re not unit profitable  is that by design  When will you be and what are the key levers   What are you doing to de risk the regulatory issues in your space   How did you arrive at your current pricing  What are the opportunities to increase it over time   Would it make more sense to focus on just one of your five revenue streams   If you have a comprehensive list of questions and answers to work with  you re much less likely to avoid simple  yet common  mistakes   You re sunk if an investor doesn t know what your company does 10 minutes into your pitch  There are a number of reasons this happens  but it s a founder s mandate to make the case for their company both simple and compelling   Sometimes it s jargon that gets in the way  but often the founder spends too much time on the market or problem being addressed   says Trenchard   Start with the basics like you re speaking to kindergartners  but advance your arguments quickly as if they re graduate students   Investors are pattern matchers  but they still need to be grounded in the fundamentals   Frame your problem in an original way  Find a very unique path to convincing them you re right and everyone else might be wrong   Here s an example from a hardware manufacturer of cell phones   says Berson   They teed up their pitch by saying that the world thinks about two types of consumers  those who are enthused by technology and those who are indifferent to it  Given expensive smart phones  they observed that most assume that consumers in the developing world are the second type of consumer  Their job was to create a product for a market where the consumer cares  but doesn t have money  I like getting a unique perspective in short order early on    Anticipate and address any objections   Draw from the concerns that your seed investors had during your last round of financing and weave in how you ve addressed them in your pitch  Force rank them from most to least prevalent  Then answer the most prevalent in that first 10 minutes of the pitch in an authentic way   says Berson   So  if you re Instacart  you need to bring up the Webvan disaster  for instance  Most investors come into a pitch with one or two big things that they think makes this business uninteresting  Know the objections and counter them early so you ve got the most engaged audience possible  As reference  Christoph Janz  the managing partner of Point Nine Capital  outlines a smart list of figures to have on hand to preempt due diligence    Don t bury your lead   It s a mistake to put compelling data in the last third of your deck  Make sure you include information that shows traction before the midpoint   says Trenchard   Describe the problem  your solution and the traction that shows that both are real  If there s more information that makes the business very attractive   from marquee customers to key partnerships   distribute that evenly throughout the deck  If you don t lead with the headline  you may feel the room start to unplug    The reality is that you may be their fifth pitch of the day  Structure your deck to not only deliver your information  but also to manage the energy in the room   Explain the customer pain point faster with emotion   In general  changing the energy in the room is your best engagement tool  Use humor or pull on heartstrings  Regardless of the approach  the customer pain has be specific and visceral for the investors   says Trenchard   If you re pitching Instacart  show the challenge of juggling kids and putting bags in the car  Most humans can understand that  But if you re freight forwarder startup Flexport  then show a bit more of why it s so damn hard to import from China  And then boom  Reveal a world where you can track your goods and get real time updates    Don t just have a dedicated competition slide   The best way to talk about competition  particularly if you re in a contested market is to address it throughout the entire deck   says Berson   Scrap your Gartner chart with its X Y axis and explain how   ideally from the customer s point of view   you re different and prevailing time and time again  So  for example  when you re on your market slide  address the holes in the market created by the fact that the competition is falling short    Put your team slide toward the end of the deck   A big speed bump for the momentum of a pitch is the mishandled team slide  First  I wouldn t put it at the front of the deck  especially because its biggest value is to demonstrate that the team is uniquely suited to tackle a problem  That full value isn t felt unless that challenge has already been explained   says Berson   Open with a quick  personal story of the founding team with very brief background and put the full team slide and explanation at the end  This will also help you avoid the trap of being 30 minutes into your presentation without getting to what they company actually does    Keep your slides simple and rely more on what you say   This is why rehearsal is so important  When founders know the exact percentage of the people that hit their landing page or click on their ad  it s more than impressive   it shows a strong commitment to knowing each part of the business   says Trenchard  Berson adds   There s a big opportunity to not put all the data on the slides  Have some on the slide to anchor the point  but then add color verbally with additional data and anecdotes    Make your appendix your arsenal   Here s a rule of thumb  if someone asks a question that has been asked once before  answer it on an appendix slide  If you have a sense that 20  of investors will geek out on quantitative marketing  make an appendix slide to reference so the other 80  don t have to endure a topic they care little about   says Berson   The major challenges to the business should be in the main deck  but cover all the secondary risks in the appendix should they come up in conversation    Don t stress about slide numbers   It s irrelevant if you have 10  20 or 25 slides  What s most important is to have a simplified  coherent story that you can tell in 20 to 30 minutes   says Berson   It s painful to see 10 jam packed slides  Give the narrative enough runway to unfold    Don t roll with an entourage   The founder or co founders should be in the room  That s it   and only if each is a vocal participant  I can t tell you the number of times we see four or more people file into the room or a co founder that speaks for 5  of the time   says Berson   Founders must show how they actively command a company  If your co founder is present but passive  there s an unintended consequence  You re signaling that you re not willing to have the tough leadership conversation with her    Pitch to your personality   It s supremely important to present in your own voice  Get inspiration   not templates   from other great founders  Find your voice by figuring out your own power alley   says Berson   If you tend to be geekier and more technical  then craft a story that leads with the numbers  If you re an extroverted leader  emphasize the people you ve recruited and culture you re building    Don t emulate Jobs or Benioff  Tell the story in your own voice  It s mandatory if you re going to get investors excited enough to squint to see a billion dollar business   Sync your timeline and your mindset   Founders must shift their thinking from winning customers to becoming the inevitable victor of a huge market opportunity that s unfolding  It s a very hard transition   says Trenchard   I ve only seen a few leaders do it naturally  For the rest of us  break from your day to day sales materials and really reset  That s what we do with Pitch Assist  In the first two hours  we conduct a  framing meeting  to identify the big story that needs to be told  The express goal is to crystalize a narrative at the right level   It s difficult for any founder to get out of the weeds of company building to the 10 000 foot view of storytelling  but it s critical to running the most successful fundraising process   That said  it s easy for the pendulum to swing too far  resulting in unhelpful abstraction   I think the biggest challenge of all is how to figure out how to bubble up your vision that s also not too high level  Pull out the universal from the ubiquitous   says Trenchard   I can t tell you how many times we ve seen decks open up with a chart showing how mobile s taking over  Every investor has seen a thousand of those charts and you unintentionally wind up looking unsophisticated  Instead  find a new way to tell the story that s oriented around the unique vantage point of the entrepreneur  and what she sees that everyone else just doesn t get    The catalyst for shifting your mindset and creating the right narrative lies within customer interviews   Normally startups have collected a lot of customer feedback while building a product  so this data can be revisited to really illustrate why customers  exact needs have been unmet before your product came along   says Berson    The real magic happens when you ve got an entrepreneur who can paint the grand story that just makes everything seem to inevitably fall into his lap   says Trenchard   But that originates from the juxtaposition of problem and solution  A lot of founders screw that up because they get into the weeds   or clouds   too much  and they miss that part of the story    The fundraising founder has to operate at the right oxygen level between the soil and the stratosphere  Not in the trenches  but not in rarified air   Exhibit unapologetic confidence  Jessica Mah  co founder and CEO of inDinero strikes the right tone when she says she s moved from being  cocky and arrogant  to channeling unapologetic confidence  When it comes to fundraising  that attitude strikes the right balance between quiet conviction and outright arrogance    Getting a vote of confidence takes  well  confidence  It s key to demonstrate that you have a great business  good numbers  and that you re going to get funded   says Trenchard   The successful founders are very honest and open about where and who they are   and  most of all  that they ll get the job done  The trick is that they show it in subtle ways    The components of unapologetic confidence can be boiled down to nuances  says Berson   When vs  if   When a founder says in a plainspoken manner   When we close  we re going to be   you know that they already see the money in the bank  There s no extra emphasis as they make the statement  but it s clear it s not in question   When talking about the future of your company orient around  when  and not  if    Near term clairvoyance   When a founder speaks about the near term  there should be real clarity  Investors understand unpredictability in the long term  but not waffling about what ll get done over the next few quarters    Demonstrated compatibility   Co CEOs almost never work  If there are co founders  each must step in to discuss their area of expertise and jurisdiction  If there s not a designated CEO yet  and one co founder grabs the mic at every question  that s a red flag  You want co founders that each contribute and speak in concert with each other  Or just choose one founder   the CEO   to run the process   It just doesn t work to have a meeting where one of the founders does 90  of the talking  If that s the case  there should only be the founding CEO in the room   Build credibility through vulnerability   One of the biggest ways to build credibility  particularly with early stage fundraising  is to be very open about what you haven t figured out yet   and to get ahead of it   says Trenchard   Admit you haven t figured out a channel or CAC  Be the first to bring it up  Every founder is scared of speaking about what they haven t figured out  But each founder that admits it earns major credibility points with investors because the reality is that investors will figure it out anyway    There are few things that are more important than your credibility as a founder in the fundraising process  protect it and don t destroy it  It s almost impossible to get back   Every business has its warts   Take Airbnb  Regulation is one of its big challenges as well as developing trust  Fleshing out how it s addressing the issue should be present in a pitch   says Trenchard   Demonstrate mastery not by being the god of a golden startup  but by showing you re aware of and addressing your challenges  That doesn t mean that you start your pitch with a download of every negative side of the business  Space it out and deploy information thoughtfully throughout the conversation   Saying   I don t know   can be one of the most helpful things you can do in a meeting and it s actually something First Round looks for in all of our founders   Overselling or hiding issues in the business always bites you in the ass  If the investor feels spun  you re done   Don t trigger the bullshit meter  In the push to create a race dynamic  many founders can exaggerate aspects of their business or the number of interested investors in their fundraising process  Here are Trenchard and Berson s warning signs that a founder is spinning rather than pitching   Quasi team members   Founders can oversell their team in the same way they might with their business  If there are holes in their leadership  they ll add key people who are yet to join the company  It gives the investor pause about the company or its founders if a star performer doesn t have the conviction to take the leap and join   This is also true for advisors  Most of the time  there s no need to discuss your advisors  The best investors are going to be asking why they re advisors and not full time team members  Leave them out of the pitch   Pipeline vs  customers   This is the slide that has a bunch of logos  only two of which are paying customers  The rest are on free trials  We see it all the time in enterprise pitches   If you have a great pipeline  you want to show it  but don t try to pass them off as current customers   Half truths and vanity metrics   This is a common mistake on the consumer side  A pitch may highlight an isolated metric  but when you plug it back into the financials  it doesn t look as good  One example is showcasing Customer Acquisition Cost  CAC  numbers that aren t fully loaded or attributed correctly  Combining paid and organic customer acquisition into one number is a great example of playing games with metrics that will undermine your credibility   Market size and competitors   Founders want to show massive markets  but they re at risk of doing so in an unsophisticated way  They throw big numbers that don t reflect their specific market in the near term  It s the same with competitors  We ll see an X Y plane with logos  but not supplemented with any nuance of what they re doing relative to the rest of the players on the field  In both cases  there s a lack of precision    Capital requested vs  capital needed   It s the top mistake we see every time  Founders default to asking for too much money  If there s no backing into that amount of capital  specific timeframe and deployment strategy  it s a direct hit to credibility    Value add platitudes   I d say 75  of the pitches we hear end with hopes to  find the right value added partner  or  we want to find a partner to build a long term relationships with and it s you   These are not bad messages  but they can come off as disingenuous if not backed up  I remember a founder who said   Listen  I m getting offers in this week  I don t know exactly where they re going to come in  but I really want you  If you do a deal at this price  we re done   The VC invested up to the mark and got the deal  There was no bullshit   just straight shooting    REHEARSAL REQUIRED  Even when we work with companies that are very large  top executives who speak publicly all the time still never want to rehearse  They ll say   Oh yeah  I ll just flip through the slides beforehand and it will be fine    that s heartbreaking because the final product could have been so much better  Practice is critical  and it s the part of the process that is the most easily overlooked  procrastinated and underutilized    There aren t any tips for getting comfortable with something that is inherently uncomfortable  You just have to feel the pain and do it   says Bloom   The worst thing you can do is go pitch in a real world scenario without rehearsing  have it go poorly  and then blame the material instead of yourself  But we see this a lot    To emphasize the importance of practice  Pitch Assist recommends that founders do one full run through of their pitch for every minute that their presentation is long  Sounds like a lot  but by the time you get to the end  you ll know it by heart and be unflappable in the face of adversity   The least painful path is to rehearse several times in private  and then slowly expand your audience  Get a few trusted friends together to watch you  Then after that  present to a few of your investors willing to give you pointers  You want to slowly push outside of your comfort zone as you get more confident  Schedule these meetings on your calendar as soon as you can  and keep your commitments  Even if you don t want a huge amount of feedback  the audience will be a forcing function to get you to run through it again and again  You have to put yourself in a situation where it s not game time but the stakes are still high   that s why pitching in front of your existing investors is so valuable   The goal should always be natural delivery   In any given meeting  a founder can be interrupted  asked to skip ahead or back  asked questions  etc  So  if you only know how to present linearly  anything unexpected is likely to throw you off your game  Knowing the material implicitly and organically will not only make you teflon in the face of these types of challenges  but will let you bring more authentic energy   In Bloom s opinion  being natural starts with understanding your personality as a presenter  Know both your strengths and your limitations   For instance  they ve seen a number of founders build really complex decks with a lot of fast paced clicks and animations  only to trip over them in their delivery  A fundraising pitch is not the time to dazzle with bells and whistles  It s the time to be incredibly clear    We might meet a founder who is really into the technical features of their product  and they love geeking out on it  so the deck should try to reflect that   says Bloom   Or maybe he or she really has more of a visionary bent   if that s the case  then they should lean into it as long as the pitch also includes the data investors want to see    If you feel uncomfortable presenting your deck  it s probably because it includes something that doesn t feel true to yourself or the mission of the company  Of course you want to try to weed this out earlier in the process  but that requires being very honest about your character  the people who work at your company  and why you re doing all of this in the first place   All that said  there are some people who are simply less adept at public speaking  and no matter how many times they rehearse  it doesn t get close to conversational  This doesn t mean they re doomed  says Bloom  There s one trick that can vastly improve their chances    Find the part of your story that you re most passionate about   he says   I mean  this is your company  You should care deeply about it  If you can hook into that feeling at key points in your pitch  you re much less likely to sound flat or wooden    PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER  In this difficult fundraising environment  the stakes are even higher  It s critical to first establish a timeline that gives a clear three month runway that aligns with both your company s growth cycle and the traditional venture capital calendar  Founders should run diligence to prioritize and vet each venture firm  but ultimately be guided by a partner s profile   One should self assess via the 10 90 rule  which will impact your fundraising schedule and how you create a race dynamic  As Series A VCs make only a few bets a year  never has avoiding the pitfalls during pitches been more crucial to sidestep  and the funding tips more vital to follow  Ultimately  all this preparation is to get a term sheet to secure the best possible partner and price    The reality is that there s a growing gulf between early stage rounds  so any enhancement to the Series A fundraising process might make the difference for an investor   says Trenchard   For Series A in particular  if there s not a clear next chapter of the story being written and a cohesive team being built  you re in hot water  Because there s less squinting for a glimmer of greatness at that growth stage  there has to be a sense of something special at play  For a series A partner  the ultimate success of your company may still be a coin flip  As a founder  don t let your pitch make it one    Photography by Bonnie Rae Mills,"[1317 1044 842 545 856 1136 14 512 1211 161 1]"

thoughts and what advice would you give to startups seeking funding in the next year    Ryan Hoover  I hope you don t mind a couple of links to my blog  but I just wrote about this topic   But in short   Keep burn as low as you can  but certainly  cut to scale  for your cash balance  Start raising early  Expect it to take longer  at all stages  but especially later stages   Have the confidence to go for the investors and price you want  but the wisdom to accept a lower price or lessor target investor if the round is too slow  Capital matters more than maximizing price    Mark Suster  General Partner at Upfront Ventures  How much growth would you need to see for  a startup  pitch to stand out above the rest    Mike Hince  It really depends on the category business  But for most companies  MoM organic growth is a very useful metric and depending on the base  20 50  MoM growth can be good  Retention  referral  and churn are all things we look at  too     Aileen Lee  Founder of Cowboy Ventures  Is there any particular pivotal moment  from either your own businesses or one you invested in  that turned the company from a slow growth trajectory to a fast growth one    Lukas Fittl  Oh yes  most didn t just explode  PayPal needed to discover the eBay listings  Yelp needed to wholly revamp its model from email to SEO and community   not friends  LinkedIn needed Outlook Uploader  reminders for invitations  SEO later  and finally identifying how to communicate the mainstream value prop  At Square  when I joined  it was not all obvious how to acquire customers SMBs in a cost efficient manner     Keith Rabois  Partner at Khosla Ventures  How much do you value cost projections    Jeffrey Doucet  At the early stage  I care more about costs than revenue because revenue is tiny and often unpredictable  whereas costs tell me how you plan to build your business  But what I m really evaluating is  70   the quality and ideas and capabilities of the team and  30   how much I believe in the market opportunity     Mark Suster  General Partner at Upfront Ventures  What kind of metrics you look at when evaluating an investment  Do you have an analyst on your team who gets involved   Alex Cook  We do have some great folks on our team who help us dive into metrics  But metrics even in the early days are too hard to forecast forward from  What we really look for are signs that some groups and communities of users are addicted  and any ways we can predict whether more groups and communities can become active on a product together  Broad but light engagement metrics are much less useful than finding at least some users who are very heavily engaged     Josh Elman  Partner at Greylock  What is on your opinion  the best way to valuate a startup making no revenue    Gauthier Maire  It s really really fucking hard to assess valuation for early stage startups  particularly those with limited usage and or early or no revenue  I ve been doing this for over ten years  and i still don t fucking know  We guess a lot     Dave McClure  Founder of 500 Startups  For a tech startup less than a year old  what should the focus be  growth or profit    Tefo  Well  first focus on usage activation  Then consider focusing on growth  as long as you can satisfy the capital needs of the business  Otherwise  you might have to focus on profit or revenue first before optimizing growth  Each startup is probably a little different  although growth is usually more important in the beginning     Dave McClure  Founder of 500 Startups  What product metrics do you look for in a consumer investment  and how do you think about helping those companies once invested    Derek Chu  We look for products that people are adopting organically  that they love  that stay on their phone s home screen  That s more qualitative than quantitative  Once we invest  however we can help we will  Lots and lots of recruiting  Lots of everything else  Company building is fun  but

down to a few things   Are the founders still in love with the problem and their customers   What s the path to at least a break even   Is the strategy to 100M revenue business still solid   Then I walk them through these questions and the opportunity cost of  a  keep going  b  soft landing  c  shutting it down and starting something new   What I suggest  all depends on the context     Dan Martell  Angel Investor   Founder of Clarity  Is it more important for entrepreneurs today to dream big dreams or attainable ones   Daniel Mirolli  You have to have a huge  big vision but take small steps  So for Uber  you need to make sure that the first 100 riders in the system get a great ride and don t wait a long time  while still imagining 1 000 riders an hour across 300 cities getting a great ride   Those are  two very different challenges  The important thing to remember is that products are experienced  typically  one user at a time  So  if you can t make the experience magical for

realism in startups    an impromptu talk I have given to any of our portfolio companies who ask   During the Q A I was asked about how I make investment decisions in early stage businesses  I was asked again in an LP meeting later in the week and then again at a founder breakfast gathering we hosted yesterday  I answered in the same way I always do so I thought I d just write it publicly    I fall in love    Yes  I know that sounds trite but it s the best way I can describe my early stage investments   I fall in love with both the founders and the concept  If I don t do both then it s highly unlikely I will invest  I know now that investments will consume many hours including late nights   early mornings and weekends  I know there will be good times and bad  I know there will be victories  set backs and even some fights   How else can I begin this multi year journey if I m not in love   Maybe some people can be dispassionate financial investors  I cannot  I spend hours thinking about the products  competitors  market opportunities  recruiting and financing of these businesses  I feel personally committed and engaged  I often form very close friendships with the teams   even if I know that I still have a fiduciary responsibility and at times could even be at odds with the economic interests of a team  But frankly  if you re honest  that s the same exact situation every CEO Founder often has with all of their team members  too   For the most part I think life is too short to work with people you don t deeply respect  admire and like or on concepts you aren t deeply passionate about   As a starting point I have to believe the founder has the attributes of an entrepreneur that matter most to me  Tenacity  resiliency  inspiration  perspiration  attention to detail  competitiveness  decisiveness  risk tolerance and integrity   I have to believe the founder is cost focused  mission driven and aligned on cultural values to me  which mostly relates to integrity and how to treat other people  I like over communicators who err on the side of transparency and candor  I need to know when we re in tough times that we re in it together  with mutual respect and trust in each other to be good actors   Of course I also have to love the concept  It s not enough to love the founding team  I don t pretend to have all the answers about what is the best type of investor or the best type of investments so please don t take this as my saying this is how everybody should invest  But I have a strong preference for   Non obvious ideas   Often as I describe to people privately why I invested the first reaction is not to immediately get it     Often as I describe to people privately why I invested the first reaction is not to immediately get it

great at this  including several of my partners    but that s not me   I have fallen in love several times in the past 2 years and in a strange set of circumstances most companies prefer to stay below the radar screen for much longer these days so most of them have not been announced  That s hard  too  because when you re passionate about companies and teams it s hard to conceal it  But obviously I respect the wishes of those teams   Anyway  since I ve now been asked three times in the past week I thought I d just write publicly what I often say privately  No magic  But hope it helps you think about how one investor approaches his job,"[1087 777 82 1317 1044 432 968 856 752 14 545]"

1136,training-dataset/business/1338.txt,business,The Quick and Dirty Guide to Creating a Winning Pitch DeckThe Quick and Dirty Guide to Creating a Winning Pitch Deck  Creating a pitch deck can seem daunting at first  especially if you ve never done it before  You probably googled   how to build a pitch deck  or looked at examples from 2010  You probably attempted to stitch something together based on what you ve learned on the internet and realized your story is fragmented   I know this problem far too well  I ve reviewed hundreds of pitch decks from early stage entrepreneurs and realized what s missing isn t necessarily the information  but more so the arrangement of the information  At the end of the day  I believe a good pitch deck   tells a compelling story that follows a logical sequence  shows strong business model validation from experiments and research data  has a clear ask at the end that is justified by thorough research  So without further adieu  let s get into it    Please note that your deck does not have to follow this order  Every startup has its own unique competitive advantage and the format would differ depending on the stage you re in  This is for your reference only   Slide 1  Problem  This is probably one of the most important slides in your deck  The reason why Dave McClure advocates   pitch the problem  not the solution   is because too many entrepreneurs try too hard to sell their solutions without educating their potential investors on what the problem is   In this slide  you will need to address the following questions as simple and concise as you can be   What is the problem   How do you know if it s a problem  Do you have primary or secondary research to back this up   Who are you solving this problem for   Example   There are over 3 million freelance lawyers and small law firms in North America and many of them are spending more than  500 month on expensive project management and billing softwares that are not helping them to do their jobs more efficiently   We ve surveyed 100 freelance lawyers and they spend on average 2 hours everyday just to process billing and filing their cases  98  of the lawyers we ve interviewed agreed that this is a major problem in the industry and they wish they can process their administration work faster   Slide 2  Solution  Now that you ve communicated to your investors that there is a big problem that needs to be solved and it has been validated by your research  you can describe how you are going to solve this problem  Here are the questions you want to answer   What are some of the alternative solutions that people are using today  Why are they not working out for them   What is your solution   How is your solution better than the alternative solutions  What are the finished story benefits   Is there anything proprietary and unique   Example   Our solution is a cloud based law practice management software that helps lawyers manage all their schedule  billing  accounts and cases   We ve tested our solution with 25 lawyers and they said we ve helped them save at least 60 minutes out of their busy day   I also love the following slides because the team at Dwolla shows how their product is so much simpler  faster and cheaper than the alternative solution   How things are before Dwolla  How things are with Dwolla  The goal of the solution slide is to elicit curiosity from the investors so they are thinking  how are you solving this problem effectively   Most entrepreneurs make the mistake of trying to describe the product and its features  but not how their solution will bring value to their customers   Slide 3  Traction  By this slide  most investors are looking for validation of your solution  The truth is  most investors don t care about the nitty gritty details of your product  Their first instinct is to evaluate whether your company is a good investment opportunity or not  You might want to answer   How many paying customers or users do you have   How much revenue are you generating  monthly annually    How much are you growing on a monthly basis   Are you profitable   Do you have key partnerships in place   Do you have key testimonials from your customers or NPS score   Note  Depending on the type of business you are in  your traction metrics might vary   I call this the  turn key slide  because it s the slide that will determine if the investor wants to keep reading or stop   Examples   Slide 4  Product  Remember back in Slide 2  you conveyed all the great benefits that your solution offers  Well here  you want to give your investors a quick demo of your product and explain to them how it works without giving away too many details  Keep the explanation simple and concise with a few screen grabs of your product   How does your product work   How does it bring value to your customers   Example   Slides 1 4 collectively form the  hook   The sole objective of these slides are to get the investors interested in your business so they would want to learn more about the opportunity   For slides 5 8  you want to convince them that there is a real market potential and you have a great plan to tackle this market   Nothing makes investors cringe harder than seeing a slide that says  We are tackling a X billion dollar market and if we capture Y percent of this market  we will be rich    While a top down analysis will show the market potential of your product  a bottom up market analysis will depict a more realistic picture to what s actually obtainable  In this slide  investors would want answers to   How big is your TAM  SAM and SOM  If your market is niche and small  talk about how you can become the big fish in a small pond   What does ideal customer profile  ICP  look like and who are your early adopters   What is the lifetime value and cost of customer acquisition of your customers  What is your churn   Example   There are 510 600 online retailers in the United States that spend  3 5 billion dollars on customer success annually  Our target market sells commodity products online in the US market and they are doing 500k 30 million dollars in annual revenue   They also spend 5 10 percent revenue annually on customer success   We found out that there are 101 680 online retailers who fit this profile so the total estimated obtainable market size is  750 million   This market is growing at a 15  rate  Currently we have 800 paying customers who are paying us  200 month   We are generating  1 92 million in annual revenue  Our churn is 2 percent and we re growing at 20 percent monthly    Read this if you re interested in learning more about how to do a bottom up market analysis   Slide 6  Competitive Analysis  One of the most frustrating questions that an entrepreneur can get is   What if Google enters your market with more resources  how do you defend it   There s no real answer to that question because until Google does that  no one would know what would happen   they could either fail miserably  Google    Glass  Google Wave etc  or have tremendous success  Google Analytics  Gmail  Google Adwords    What you could show is your confidence in adapting to the market and carving out your piece while demonstrating your current customer satisfaction and loyalty  Consider these questions   How do you position yourself in the market   How do you defend your market against your competitors   What is your secret sauce  How are you going to become better than your competitors   Examples    Personally  I don t like the  check box  comparison chart of all the features you have because it could be very biased  I would explore ways to show how your startup can obtain another key segment of the market faster than your competitors   Slide 7  Business Model  Ash Maurya once said    The true product of an entrepreneur is not the solution  but a working business model  The real job of an entrepreneur is to systematically de risk that business model over time    In this slide  you want to show how your business model works and how it has been validated with your early adopters  The key questions to answer here are   How do you make money   How have this business model been validated through experiments or case studies   Example   Slide 8  Go to Market Strategy  Now that you have identified your target market and the business model  you want to let your investors know how you are going to obtain this market   Your go to market strategy should have already been validated on a smaller scale and you should have already identified the most effective customer acquisition channels  Here you want to answer   How are you going to get your product to the hands of your customers   Which channels are you going to focus on given your current resources  What have you done to validate that these are the most effective channels   What is your competitive distribution strategy   Example   Slide 9  Ask   Financials  In order to support these ambitious customer acquisition strategies that you have just laid out  you need to ask for investment  This is the moment that your entire deck has been building up for   By now  the investors should understand why your company is a good investment opportunity and they are wondering how much capital you need to make this happen  You want to answer   How much capital do you need for further validation of your business model   What is your runway and what is your burn   What is the breakdown of capital allocation  What are you going to spend it on   What is the cost of customer acquisition  How confident are you that it is going to stay under a certain range   Example   We are asking for  600 000 at  3 000 000 pre money valuation to fund our customer acquisition strategies and product roadmap  This will give us 18 months of runaway to repeat and scale our business model   We are spending the first 250k on hiring one back end developer  one UX designer and one customer success person  This team will help us get to problem solution fit and further validate our acquisition channels   We think our cost of customer acquisition is  10 through Facebook advertising  but we re 99 percent confident that it will be below  15  Through this estimation  if we invest the next 50k into Facebook advertising  it will help us acquire 3 300 customers and each customer has an average lifetime value of  250   In order to sustain our growth  we will need to spend the next 300k hiring one growth marketer  one more customer success person  and two developers   Here is our financial projection of the next 18 months based on our growth rate in the past  We anticipate to generate  2M in ARR by September 2017   Koho wrote a great blog on how they used  1000 to raise  1M  They also created a great tool to help you calculate your CAC and the confidence level   Slide 10  Team  In this slide  you want to introduce your team  your roles and past experiences  Explain to the investors why you are the best team to execute this idea   Who is on your team and what are their relevant skills and experiences  Where did you meet your co founders and what have you done in the past together to show that you can work well together   Who are your advisors and why are their experience relevant to the problem you are solving   Example   Slide 11  Vision  The vision should be communicated in your title slide as a high level pitch or tagline and at the very end to remind your investors why they should care   After the investors are presented with all the facts  data and validation and if the numbers check out  they would want to hear about why you are convicted to make this work   Remember  at the early stage  investors are investing in the likelihood that you are the right person to solve this problem   What is your vision   Why are you driven to achieve this vision   Example   Facebook   Our mission is to make the world more open and connected  We do this by giving people the power to share whatever they want and be connected to whoever they want  no matter where they are     Our mission is to make the world more open and connected  We do this by giving people the power to share whatever they

observed in this world  We know this is a major problem because it is validated by this credible research and stats  Through our own research  we have also confirmed that this is a major problem  Currently  people are using these alternative solutions and they re not working out so well because of these reasons  We believe our solution will solve this problem because it does this amazing thing that will greatly benefit our target customers  We ve tested this solution with a few beta customers and they absolutely agree that we ve solved this problem for them  In fact  our current traction shows that we have X number of paying customers with positive NPS score  Our ARR is this and our MRR is this  We are growing at X   monthly  We also have these major distribution partners onboard  We ve been featured in these media for our recent accomplishments  Our product is designed and built to solve this problem  This is what it looks like and this is how it works  Customers love us because it brings them these benefits  The market size is this big and this is our obtainable market size  This market is growing X percentage each year  This is how we position ourselves against our competitors  This is why we are better  At the moment  our cost of customer acquisition is X amount and the lifetime value of a customer is Y amount  We are confident with the support from the partners we are currently negotiating with  we can bring the CAC down to this amount and LTV up to this amount  We also plan on tackling these channels with these resources  To support our go to market strategy and reinforce our validated business model  we are asking for X amount of investment at Y pre money valuation  The discount is X   by this date  The first portion of the investment will be used to validate this experiment  From the results of this experiment  we will have a clear understanding of how to get to problem solution fit  We will then invest X amount in hiring these key employees to help us create a scalable and repeatable business model  This is our historical financials in terms of revenue  cost and margins  This is our forecasted based on our   of growth per month  We anticipate to hit this much ARR and MRR in the next 3 5 years  This is our team  We have X number of years of combined experience in these areas of expertise  This is our background and past experience  We have also brought on these advisors who are experts in these fields  Given our expertise and experience  we believe we are the best team to solve this problem  Our vision is to bring this value to these people  Having to see this problem first hand  we re driven by and grounded by this vision  We see a real opportunity to change the way things are and we invite you to join us in achieving this  Thank you  Please contact this email or number if you are interested in learning more   Last Words of Wisdom  Often times entrepreneurs would feel entitled to investment because they believe they have a great idea  There is also a naive outlook that investors have a lot of money and they would invest in anyone with a great idea   These myths in the startup bubble are contributing to the communication gaps between the entrepreneurs and the investors   First and foremost  an entrepreneur should understand how venture capital work and put themselves in the shoes of the investors   If you are raising venture capital  the VC who is listening to your pitch has a mandate to return X amount of dollars back to his or her investors  who are the limited partners of the VC firm   Therefore  VCs need to make bets on companies with defensible products  with some degree of validation  in growing markets   To get an idea of how thorough and careful VCs are about investing other people s money  you should take a look at their due diligence checklist   And finally  here is a great collection of pitch decks from VC backed startups in the last couple of years,"[1136 1044 1317

1150,training-dataset/business/354.txt,business,How to Use Thought Experiments to De Risk Your Startup   Coding VCHow to Use Thought Experiments to De Risk Your Startup   In preparing for battle  I have always found that plans are useless but planning is indispensable     Dwight D  Eisenhower  In the early days of building a company  it s hard to step back and think about the bigger picture when there are always so many fires to fight or opportunities to chase down  That s a shame  because looking at your business from a 50 000 foot view often reveals areas of misplaced focus or resource misallocation   One technique that can break through the bubble of always being in the weeds is conducting occasional thought experiments that give you insight into your company  This post is a catalog of sixteen useful thought experiments  Each experiment consists of a thought provoking question and an explanation of that question s purpose motivation  Most of these thought experiments require a different frame of reference on your company    either from the perspective of another person or another time period  Many of the experiments directly correspond to the risk categories discussed in my previous post  How to De Risk a Startup   Caveat  some of these experiments are aimed at seed stage b2b startups  but most are applicable to the majority of startups   List of Thought Experiments  Looking at the present  Looking back from the near future   One year from now    Looking back from the distant future   5 10 years from now    Looking at the present  How do competitors view you   Think about your 2 3 closest competitors  If you asked their CEOs to truthfully describe your company s strengths and vulnerabilities  what would each of them say   Motivation  Competitors will view you differently based on their traction  their leadership  and their own strengths and weaknesses  For the most part  your competitors are not dumb and they are not just going to lie around waiting for you to steamroll them  Looking at yourself from their perspectives can give you a better sense of your own company s strengths and weaknesses   Are you ready for a Series A   Imagine you suddenly have access to an additional  10m of capital to scale your business  Would you know what to do with it  If not  what would you need to figure out before you could make good use of more capital   Motivation  Most Series As provide capital to double down on what s working  If you ve figured out some good strategies for sales and marketing and need to staff up in those departments  or if your engineering team is struggling to keep up with paying customers  feature requests  then those are good reasons to raise more money  If you need more capital to keep the company alive but don t have a clear plan for using that money then you re probably not ready for your next major round of financing   The other side of the table  Imagine that instead of being the founder of your company  you re an investor who doesn t know anything about the company or the market it s pursuing  What would you want to know to understand the business  What questions would you ask  Where would you be skeptical  If you invest in 1  2  of the startups that you research  what would get you excited enough to invest here   Motivation  It s easy to forget that other people    including investors    know much less about your business than you do  Your pitch should be designed to get investors excited about the opportunity and to allay concerns they might have  Thinking about your company from a layperson investor s perspective can help you understand which aspects of your company should be emphasized and which ones need longer explanations   The debate from hell  You re in a debate competition  The subject of the debate is the viability of your startup  whether the problem being addressed is legit  whether the market is big enough  whether your approach is right  et cetera   You re taking the  pro  side and an award winning debater is taking the  against  side  Your opponent does their best to rip your idea to shreds  What arguments does your opponent make  How do you respond   Motivation  during first meetings  most investors are looking for  reasons to say no   An investor might only invest in 1  of the companies they see  so a typical investor process is to pass on  80  of pitches quickly so that more time can be spent on the remaining 10 20   Considering your startup from the point of view of someone who is  initially  trying to dismiss your idea can help improve your pitch and address its weaknesses   Looking back from the near future  For the following thought experiments  pretend that you re looking back on your company one year from now   Was your MVP truly minimal   You ve hit product market fit  One of your learnings is that your Minimum Viable Product ended up going far beyond  minimal   Which features could you have left out   Motivation  People often overestimate what s required for an MVP  An MVP can be as simple as a founder armed with a cell phone and a spreadsheet  Stepping back and thinking about your product from a future perspective might give you ideas for what you can cut before launching  The sooner you launcher  the sooner you can learn about what your customers really want   Stomach churning churn numbers  Half of the customers that signed up last year decided not to renew their annual contracts this year  Why did that happen  What parts of your product service customer experience made them leave   Motivation  Once they starting booking revenue  companies sometimes over focus on growth while neglecting engagement and retention  Thinking about why users might not renew can help avoid churn issues before they become serious   The missing key  You realize your company would ve made a lot more progress if you had hired earlier for a key role  What was that role  What were the signs that you should ve hired someone for that role a little sooner   Motivation  Because time and money are so limited at most companies  founders will often take over jobs they re unfamiliar with in order to keep costs manageable  That might mean the CEO is doing sales despite coming from engineering background  or it could mean the CTO is doing basic company accounting  Wearing many hats is a necessity at startups  but sometimes you need to hire a professional for a certain hat  Thinking about the  appropriateness  of what founders and employees are doing each month can uncover areas where additional full time or part time hires are necessary  There are often early warning signs that some function is being handled very inefficiently or even dangerously   Laughed out of the room  You recently started your fundraising process  One of the most respected funds that you talked to  e g  Sequoia  Benchmark  etc  said your pitch is one of the worst they ve heard all year  What made them say that   Motivation  The earlier  debate from hell  thought experiment was about looking for flaws in your business plan  This experiment is about finding flaws in your pitch  like claims that are true but which sound crazy or implausible  or ideas that require much more explanation than what you typically offer   Sunk Cost Fallacy  As you look back on last year  you realize you spent too much time on several initiatives because of sunk costs  What were those areas  and what were the signs that you should ve cut your losses instead of continuing to waste more resources   Motivation  People are prone to continuing dead end projects because they ve already invested so much time and effort into them  This is especially dangerous at startups  which have very limited time to reach key milestones before running out of money  This thought experiment is designed to help you see if sunk costs are causing you to waste your time   Misplaced focus  As you look back on last year  you see periods of time where your company focused on the wrong things  Reflecting on these periods  you realize that you overlooked many signs that your resources were being wasted  Where did you waste your time and what were the signs that you should ve been working on something else   Motivation  Sometimes you miss signs that things aren t working  Maybe engineers keep going to Google or Twitter instead of accepting your job offers  or maybe very few customers agree to see your demo after an initial discovery call  When you re scrambling day to day  you might think   if 5  of people want to see a demo  then I should call at least 40 people daily   Months later  you realize that the low demo rate was a sign that your product didn t fit the market s needs  It s helpful to step back and ask yourself if the things that you re struggling with today are a sign that you need to optimize or double down on your processes  or if they re a sign of something more significant  like working on the wrong product or targeting the wrong job candidates   Looking back from the distant future  For the following thought experiments  pretend that you re looking back one your company 5 10 years from now   Unexpectedly large market  You re company is very successful at this point  and you ve learned that your target market is actually 10x bigger than your original estimate  Where did the extra market size come from   Motivation  This experiment might help you see opportunities in selling to adjacent target audiences  or selling additional products to your existing target audience   Unexpectedly small market  Your company s growth has plateaued  and you ve learned that your target market is actually 10x samller than your original estimate  Why did the market initially seem so much bigger than it actually was   Motivation  This is a good way to scrutinize how many people have the problem you re solving  and whether the problem is severe or mild  It s tempting to throw out impressive market size statistics  but sometimes numbers are misleading and you waste years of your life chasing a market that turns out to be unattractive   The world of the future  How does the trajectory of the world over the next 5 10 years align  or misalign  with what you re doing  Which trends will help you and which trends will hurt you  What s the expected timeline for those trends    Motivation  an idea that is good or bad today might look very different 5 10 years from now  For example  solving parking problems is a big deal in 2016  but perhaps fleets of autonomous vehicles will eventually make parking garages obsolete  Thinking about relevant trends can help you pursue the optimal path for your company  It would be a shame if you found a solution to a major problem and started scaling your company just as technological or regulatory or social trends made that problem disappear   The badass competitor  Elon Musk  no longer content with developing solar powered autonomous vehicles that roam the surface of Mars  decides that his next company will be a direct competitor to you  What barriers to entry and competitive moats have you built up that will keep Elon s efforts at bay   Motivation  A lot of founders think their special sauce is how well they execute  The problem is that almost everyone thinks they have superior execution skills  Thinking about what you would against competition that executes even better than you can provide clarity about your true strengths  as well as how you can apply those strengths to build a strong competitive moat around your company   The nightmare competitor  After you raised your  100m Series E  a lot competitors emerged  Everyone wants a piece of your pie  Most of these competitors don t worry you  except for Company X  Company X has tons of cash and is in a particularly strong position to compete with you  What makes them so formidable   Motivation  There are often one or two companies that would be particularly intimidating as competitors  These companies might have great access to your target customers  tons of world class talent  or a product that lets them get between you and your users and slowly take over your relationship  e g  how Google uses its search engine to highlight its own reviews at the expense of Yelp and TripAdvisor   It s important to be mindful of the companies that are best positioned to compete with you  These companies might not care about your market today  but they could change their minds in the future once your company has reached an enviable size  Knowing which companies to be cautious of can help you plan and set up barriers that prevent those companies from pursuing your market   The disgruntled competitor  After almost a decade of working together  you just had a falling out with one of your key execs  They quit their job and decide to start a company that will put yours out of business  What actions have you taken over the years to address this threat   Motivation  This is subtly different from the  fearsome competitor  scenario  That scenario is focused on realistic worst case competitors  This scenario is focused on the hypothetical worst case competitor  someone with funding  a chip on your shoulder  and insider knowledge about everything related to your company   How to use these thought experiments  While not all of these questions will apply to every company  it s a good exercise to think about them one by one  By analyzing your company from different perspectives and asking yourself challenging  through provoking questions  you ll be able to have a better understanding of your strengths and weaknesses  areas where you might be mismanaging your resources  and future opportunities   The best way to get value out of these thought experiments is to occasionally pick a question and think about it for 5 or 10 or 30 minutes  If a train of thought proves useful  discuss it with your coworkers and revisit the question every few months   I hope you will find these thought experiments to be a helpful exercise for moving your company forward  If there are other thought experiments that have been valuable for you  please let me

1158,training-dataset/business/1077.txt,business,Fred Wilson and Andy Weissman Talk with Lindel Eakman about Transitioning Leadership at a VC FundFred Wilson and Andy Weissman Talk with Lindel Eakman about Transitioning Leadership at a VC Fund  Union Square Ventures  USV  has been one of the most successful venture capital firms of the past 10 15 years and continues to be a leader in our industry  Recently the firms two founding partners  and also Managing Partners    Fred Wilson and Brad Burnham   decided to transition management of the firm to Andy Weissman  who joined in 2012  and Albert Wenger  joined in 2008 and writes one of the most thoughtful blogs in our industry   Fred   Brad aren t leaving but wanted Andy   Albert to take over management   Transitions do happen in VC funds but many fail to make the move in a timely fashion and lose key younger personnel who break off and do their own funds or else the strong personalities of senior partners make it harder for new partners to flourish   So it was a timely conversation at this year s Upfront Summit because the week of the Summit  Sequoia had announced that it was transitioning leadership from Jim Goetz to Roelof Botha  and US operations to Alfred Lin   This followed the firms founder Don Valentine handing leadership early to Mike Moritz and Doug Leone who then entrusted Jim Goetz  And so it goes  The great firms transition day to day leadership and often those who don t fail to protect their  franchise value    Many readers know that at Upfront Ventures that s precisely what happened at our own firm in 2011 when our founding partner and my co Managing Partner  Yves Sisteron  asked me to lead the daily management of our firm  Yves didn t want to step down   he is still as active as any partner on our team   but he wanted me to take responsibility for  Strategy  recruiting  team development  LP relations  financial planning  etc  This has worked out tremendously well for us as I still have my mentor guiding the firm and he gets to look for deals that can have a massive impact on society and on returns for our LPs  Essentially we run the firm together but play different roles   Lindel Eakman led the discussion with Fred and Andy  Lindel is heading Foundry Group Next  which is a Foundry Group fund that invests in both venture capital funds as well as directly in startups at later stages in their cycles than Foundry Group s core fund would typically do  Lindel is no stranger to thorny venture capital issues   he was arguably amongst the most successful LPs of his generation  At UTIMCO  University of Texas s endowment fund  he eschewed some of the older VC  access brands  and in stead invested in funds few had heard of at the time like  USV  Foundry Group  Spark Capital  True Ventures and Upfront Ventures      and when you re an early  anchor  in a fund you end up with a relatively large percentage of each fund   In my years of meeting Lindel before he invested in Upfront he seemed to focus more on one component of future venture capital returns than other LPs did   team dynamics  He did what every LP did  looked at returns  talked to portfolio companies  talked with our competitors and so forth  But he seemed to really want to dig deep in the fabric of the human relationships across partners and the role that Managing Partners played  I think this is why he was so successful as an LP and why the interview below is so worth watching  but I provide written notes below  t00    The full video is embedded and you should watch the video as you could learn a lot  It s classic Lindel   Fred with insights on what Andy Weissman has brought to USV  apparently he s a lot nicer than the other guys    which I can tell you from first hand experience they re all pretty nice  but perhaps he s more approachable   I love the way my partner Kara Nortman phrases it about Upfront Ventures   We all have the same back end  you just have to deal with different UI s to experience that   Maybe that s USV  too   So what is the importance of succession planning in VC  Fred Started     Particularly in Silicon Valley there are a handful of firms that have stayed in the top tier for 2  3  4 generations and those franchises are really  really powerful franchises as a result  And every LP would want to be an investor in those funds and those firms     It may not be a lot that you can say have done it well but I think we can say that the ones who have done it well have seen a massive benefit from doing it well     Fred Wilson  Lindel then went on to read a quote from the Sequoia transition announcement    Disruption is at the heart of our business  It s what creates opportunities for the entrepreneurs and it s what helps them produce great returns for the LPs  Ironically it s also the force that many venture capital firms resist   often contributing to their own decline   They talk about a ton of other hard topics that would be relevant for any venture capital fund to watch and learn but may also be interesting for entrepreneurs to better understand the worlds of those who invest in them  Issues they discussed,"[1158 654 398 545 1 751 752 182 687

1186,training-dataset/business/141.txt,business,Should you raise on convertible notes or do an   Should you raise on convertible notes or do an equity round   Check out my side project Rejectionathon  discount code  EYFRIENDS   which helps founders get over their fear of rejection     A reader named Turner Dean recently asked me whether it s better to raise seed money on convertible notes or straight up equity  Since this is a hefty topic that we could discuss for days  in this post I ll aim to cover just the pros and cons of each from a founder s perspective and will NOT cover     What is a convertible note  equity  or convertible security     What major terms you should look for   be aware of   ask for     There are a ton of other blogs out there that will cover these two topics in great detail  My expectation is that you ll check out some of those other resources first if you re not familiar with any of this  Just do a Google search   In general  I m a big fan of convertible notes or convertible securities for seed stage founders  These are the big pros     cheap  quick   you can start bringing in money immediately  there s no such thing as a round  so you can start and stop raising at any time    Cheap  Because convertible notes and convertible securities are basically standard   in fact  if you re not using one from the internet  your lawyer should be able to provide you with a free template  at least most lawyers in the Silicon Valley  that you can modify  This should be basically free  I think my total legal bill for getting my seed round done for LaunchBit was something like    3000  In contrast  if you do an equity round  you as the founder will often have to pay  20k  50k in legal bills  You may also be on the hook for your investors  legal bills  though this is changing a lot these days   Quick  Once you get a convertible note signed  you can ask your investor to wire you the money or send you a check  You can start bringing money into your bank account right away and can start deploying it immediately  In contrast  if you do an equity round  you have to complete the entire round and go through the full due diligence process before anyone wires you money  This process can take a couple of months  Frankly  in my opinion  if you re a fast growing startup that s deploying capital into your growth process  you really can t afford to wait months   Flexibility  With an equity round  there s a specific amount of money you are raising  With a convertible note or a convertible security  while there may be an upper bound to a note  there s no fixed amount you need to raise  You can always create new notes easily to raise more money if you need to or not raise the full amount you had intended under your existing note  Flexibility is good  because you may want to change the nature of your round as you see what the uptake is  If you have great uptake  you may end up wanting to raise more money on another tranche of notes at a higher cap  If the uptake is bad  you may just want to wrap up your round shy of your initial target round and go back out into the market and raise again later once you ve made more progress   In reality  at such an early stage  it almost doesn t make sense to do a priced round  because you don t know what the fundraising landscape will be apriori  You may not know what you ll be able to raise or what makes sense to raise before you start     Jason Lemkin has referenced a lot of the cons of doing convertible notes   convertible securities in his blog post here  Namely     Investors spend less time with you   feel less committed to the company   won t help you as much w  your next round    Your legal bill will be higher later when you have to sort out of all your notes when they convert to equity    Investors  A big reason investors feel less committed when they sign convertible notes is that they just don t know what their stake will be in the end  Downstream investors can potentially rewrite a lot of the conversion terms later  screwing over earlier investors  This happens more than you can imagine  So early stage investors tend to be more wary of convertible notes   convertible securities  Some early stage investors  especially outside of the Silicon Valley  still won t do any deal that is on a convertible note or convertible security  so if you re not based in the Silicon Valley  this is something to consider  Despite this  I still think convertible notes   convertible securities are founder friendly  and worth doing as an investor  The bigger lessons for us as investors are probably around trying to steer founders away from piranha ish downstream VCs   Legal bill  Sorting out all of your convertible notes at what caps  etc  will become a bear when you raise your first equity round  This is especially true if you follow a tranche strategy that i m a big proponent of  more on this later   And  you ll pay for this later when you sort it out with your lawyer  That being said  I still think it s better to raise money in tranches on a convertible note   convertible security and defer your complicated conversion to equity later  I see this a bit akin to technical debt  As a startup  you need to often do what is best for you now in the quickest   scrappiest   cheapest way possible otherwise you just won t make it  We hold this to be true in product development  and it should also hold true when raising your seed round  You just don t have time or money to worry about making things clean now  But when you have more resources later  you will pay for it  And that s ok  If you get there  big props to you  Most companies never get to a true series A equity round and never have to worry about this deferred legal bill   While there are a lot of pros and cons to raising on a convertible note or convertible security  if you are based in the Silicon Valley  I think it makes a lot of sense to do so as a founder at the seed round   Fundraising is a nebulous process that I aim to make more transparent  To learn more secrets and tips  subscribe to my newsletter,"[1186 844 1015 545 711 943 210 14 1317 1044 1]"

1211,training-dataset/business/864.txt,business,Startup Seed Raising SkilzzzA bunch of companies I m involved in have gone for seed funding in the last few months  After one of them asked for the ultra warrior l33t skillz  I thought I d put this post up and break it down   If any of you are raising your first startup or seed money  this is a must read  Would love to hear any of your stories feedback in the comments on this post   Priming the pump  How do you get started with rounding up some angels for a seed round  It s pretty simple  Go to angel gatherings  industry conferences  any and all networking events  Meet people who are angels or who know angels  Give  em the elevator pitch  KEEP IT SHORT  Set up Intro meetings  Also  if you re not located in a startup hotspot  then find make a friend in Silicon Valley and stay on his her couch for a month and make sure you re meeting with somebody new EVERY DAY   Intro meetings  Informal discussion where you pitch the company over a lunch coffee etc   and expand potential angel network through referrals  Get your pitch down to 5 10 minutes  and prepare a tight FAQ in your head so that you have tight answers to the top 20 questions  Let them pay  Be proud of your scrappiness   ABC s   Always Be Closing  At the end of every meeting  get a clear understanding of where they stand on your deal opportunity  Shoot for getting an amount they would be interested in investing  You won t usually get a commitment on the first meeting but do not accept vagueness  Get a clear idea of where they stand  and what next steps might be to move them through the pipeline  Hypotheticals are also useful  When I lock on my lead investor  how much would you be interested in investing   Referrals are key   Glad you re pumped  any thoughts on who else I should meet with   If your pitch is kicking ass  then most angels will immediately offer up a couple folks they can hook you up with  Regardless  always ask for more folks you can connect with   Advisors  Turn a couple of these potential angels into advisors  Having a few top notch people in your corner can make all the difference in turning the tide in an angel round  Everybody s going to want to help and everybody will want a piece  Be selective  don t settle  An average advisor is worth 1 10 the amount of an awesome advisor  Make it known that you expect your advisors to invest in the round  No exceptions an advisor that doesn t invest in the round will have significantly less influence in helping you close a round   Thought Partner  Pick one advisor  co founder  or mentor who will be your thought partner in managing the process  There is a lot of activity as you go to get your first term sheet  all the way through the close  Strange shit you cannot predict WILL go down  Big personalities  money  valuation  ego  all that makes a nice recipe for some crazy shenanigans  Nailing your messaging  managing the big personalities  keeping momentum going  takes a certain amount of magic  and making that happen is not accidental  It s hard work  hustle  credibility  and preparation  and you ll be much better at it with a partner in crime who can help you think through the issues  and craziness that inevitably will go down as you get to closing   TheList  Keep a list  aka pipeline  of the people you re meeting with  the referrals that they provide you  and the level of their interest in the seed round  Stay on the ball Always follow up be the pro that impresses all those investors that interact with you   Passion Charisma  This is the X factor  It separates the men from the boys in fundraising  If you re doing a startup  you re trying to change the world  you ve kicked your cushy job to the curb  you ve had Ramen noodles for breakfast lunch and dinner as far as you can remember  and maybe you ve moved back in with the  rents  You ve definitely got the passion why else would you be doing this  Don t be afraid to show it  Every pitch could be your last one  i e  the dude across the table writes you a check    know that  give it your all  listen to some music that pumps you up before you get into the meeting  think about all of the great shit you re doing and could do  Focus on the positive  have confidence  be amped  bring passion to your game  and share the love with the person across from you  bring extreme positivity into the potential investor s otherwise boring pedestrian day  Watch some of  garyvee to see this in its purest form   Credibility  DO NOT FIGHT THE TRUTH  If you do  you will become road kill  Do not try to spin out of what your weak points are  Do not try to make something certain that is not  Do not pretend to know something that you don t  Credibility is the name of the game in fundraising  Every startup investor knows there are uncertainties  We all know there are risks  Accept them for what they are  BUT have a SMART answer for them  How are you addressing the uncertainties  How are you dealing with the risks  Show them you have thought 2 or 3 steps ahead  Be frank and to the point about negative concerns  and always try to focus negative concerns toward your strengths and your positives   Momentum and Urgency  Investors are fickle creatures  they are motivated by fear and greed  and without it they will take their time and hem and haw at every turn  They will turn a 3 week process into a 6 month process  Time IS NOT YOUR FRIEND  The longer the process drags out  the more it seems that nobody is interested in your deal  and the less likely you are to actually get one  AND even if you do  with every day you will be sinking more time and energy into the process and less into your company  Every communication you have with prospective investors must include a sense of momentum and urgency in the deal process   Things are moving quickly    My day is packed with meetings    Many parties are interested    This deal could come together quickly   You back this up with hard work and serious hustle  Keep your update conversations short  Make the Urgency a reality by working your ass off  It will become a self fufilling prophecy and your deal will get done   Getting the Lead  You can get all of the investors in the world amped on your deal  but until you have a lead  you don t have a deal  What is a lead  The lead in a deal is the investor  usually one of the largest  who negotiates the T s and C s and essentially sets the terms for the round of funding  essentially providing you with a term sheet  The way to get a lead is to spur one of the larger  most interested investors into making an offer  Ask him what it s going to take to make a deal happen  what kind of terms he had in mind  what would make this an exciting deal  You can make momentum moves with this request  by making it clear that you re going to other investors and having the same conversation with them  Make it a matter of  shit or get off the pot   but in a polite way    The Competitive Deal   The Need for Speed  The second you have a single term sheet  you need to move  very  quickly to get a second one  You don t have a lot of time  because momentum at this point is crucial to closing and your first lead does not want to feel like he s being dicked around  Your second term sheet will be easier to get than your first  but it will make a HUGE impact on your deal  Without a second termsheet  you will be in a position to take whatever crappy terms the original lead provided  and it s quite possible that the terms could get worse  or even go away   as the one termsheet deal drags out  Figure out who those 2 or 3 potential other leads are and hustle the hell out of them  Here s a voicemail I left on a 2nd termsheet prospect on a recent  competitive  deal I was involved in  The recipient of this voicemail called back in 5 minutes  AND ended up being the lead on the deal  notice the urgency while staying true and credible    Hey   wanted to check in with you regarding      things are heating up with a couple other parties and it looks like things could get done pretty quickly from here  wanted to check in with you  see where you re head s at on the deal  and see if we there s a shot we can work together on this one  give me a call back as soon as you can  talk to you soon  Herding the cattle  Once you start working the competitive leads  you need to start getting word out to ALL of the interested parties  that this deal is getting hot  and that you could start moving to close in very short order  This is key to continue momentum with the deal and keep your potential leads hot  If they know you have  200 300k following their investment  then they feel even better about your company knowing all the other folks are interested too  This makes them anxious about the competitive situation you ve created b c now your deal has been validated  On the other side  the small investors that were interested in following  now feel that this is a real deal that they can really follow  and since there are big guys involved putting in real money  they ll essentially commit to an amount w o necessarily having all the final terms  Nail those follow on investors to an amount  Make sure those competitive leads know that you re bringing a lot of extra money to the table   Anti Collusion  Once you lock on your lead investor  there are a lot of terms still left to fill out  The heavyweights in your deal will have the inclination to collude to make the terms better  They know they re in the deal and the delays that happen when final docs are getting fully locked makes them rambunctious  Keep it short and sweet with each potential colluder  and draw a very straight firm line that the material terms are not changing  That kind of leadership will keep you from having what I call an investor revolt before you even get the deal done   Sprint through the close  The best entrepreneurs  never  stop selling  The finish line is in their sites  and it s pretty clear they re going to make it across  but they don t let up  they sprint even harder through that finish line  I like to say that until the deal is closed  you have at best a 50 50 shot of it happening  Keep working new seed investors  keep the competitive leads warm  get your deal oversubscribed  because until your deal is done  it s just a nice fantasy in your head  The best sprinters sprint through the finish line  and the best entrepreneurs sprint through the close,"[1211 1015 545 1317 1044 842 29 856 14 33 1]"
1221,training-dataset/business/1454.txt,business,Why Value Capture is the Most Important Business Idea You Haven t Read Enough AboutGreat businesses don t have to be big   and big businesses can be awful  The measure of the quality of a business is all about Value Creation and Value Capture   Value Capture  a business s ability to create profit from it s transactions  is one of the most interesting and under studied areas of business  In my reading and research I ve seen material on it  though rarely with the same terminology   It s a concept explored by people like Warren Buffett  Charlie Munger  Peter Thiel  Bill Gurley  and many academics  though knowledge doesn t build and compound because everyone talks about it just a little differently   This is a topic that I ve been fascinated with for a while  making it really fun to put this collection together  Any topic that has overlapping opinions from Charlie Munger and Peter Thiel is something to get excited about   In this Collection of Evergreen  we ll explore   The Relationship Between Value Creation   Value Capture  How Required Reinvestment Destroys Value Capture  Why Not All Revenue is Created Equal  How Pricing is the True Test of Value Capture  How to Capture More Value  How Measure Value Capture  and it s Inevitable Decline  Enemies of Value Capture  The Red Queen Effect  Independence of Value Creation   Value Capture  This is one of Peter Thiel s favorite topics  He calls it one of the most important and least understood thing in business  It is the first topic that he goes through in his talk at Stanford this year  and he devoted chapters to it in his book  Zero to One   Here are some of the highlights from Thiel s book   What Valuable company is no one building  This question is harder than it looks  because your company could create a lot of value without becoming very valuable itself  Creating value is not enough   you also need to capture some of the value you create   The big idea from his lecture is this   A business creates X Dollars and captures Y  of  X   X and Y are Independent Variables   X and Y have nothing to do with each other  They are not interrelated at all  Just because a business is large  does not mean that it is making a huge amount of money  Conversely  very high quality small companies can capture huge percentages of their revenue   That means that even very big businesses can be bad businesses  For example  US airline companies service millions of passengers and create hundreds of billions of dollars of value each year  But in 2012  when the average airfare each way was  178  the airlines only made  0 37 per passenger trip  Compare them to Google  which creates less value but captures far more  Google brought in  50 billion in 2012  vs  195 billion for the airlines   but it kept 21  of those revenues as profits   nearly 100x the airline industry s profit margin that year  Google makes so much money that it is worth 5x more than all US Airlines combined   By these numbers  Google is 100x more effective at capturing value than the airlines  We ll get into this more later  but margin is a good basic proxy for ability to capture value  Google has this power because it owns its market   Google has a monopoly on search   Whereas a competitive firm must sell at a market price  a monopoly owns its market  so it can set its own prices  Since it has no competition  it produces at the quantity and price combination that maximizes profits      by  monopoly  we mean the kind of company that s so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute   So  from Peter Thiel  the first rule of value capture   The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear  if you want to create and capture lasting value  don t build an undifferentiated commodity business   Buffett   Munger on Value Capture and Reinvestment  Warren Buffett learned this lesson himself early on  after buying Berkshire Hathaway  which was then a slowly dying textile manufacturing business  Charlie Munger tells that story here  and shows how tough it is to capture value in commodity businesses   Yes  this is a long excerpt  But it s Munger and it s a fantastic lesson   For example  when we were in the textile business  which is a terrible commodity business  we were making low end textiles   which are a real commodity product  And one day  the people came to Warren and said   They ve invented a new loom that we think will do twice as much work as our old ones    And Warren said   Gee  I hope this doesn t work because if it does  I m going to close the mill   And he meant it   What was he thinking  He was thinking   It s a lousy business  We re earning substandard returns and keeping it open just to be nice to the elderly workers  But we re not going to put huge amounts of new capital into a lousy business    And he knew that the huge productivity increases that would come from a better machine introduced into the production of a commodity product would all go to the benefit of the buyers of the textiles  Nothing was going to stick to our ribs as owners   That s such an obvious concept   that there are all kinds of wonderful new inventions that give you nothing as owners except the opportunity to spend a lot more money in a business that s still going to be lousy  The money still won t come to you  All of the advantages from great improvements are going to flow through to the customers   Conversely  if you own the only newspaper in Oshkosh and they were to invent more efficient ways of composing the whole newspaper  then when you got rid of the old technology and got new fancy computers and so forth  all of the savings would come right through to the bottom line   In all cases  the people who sell the machinery   and  by and large  even the internal bureaucrats urging you to buy the equipment   show you projections with the amount you ll save at current prices with the new technology  However  they don t do the second step of the analysis which is to determine how much is going stay home and how much is just going to flow through to the customer  I ve never seen a single projection incorporating that second step in my life  And I see them all the time  Rather  they always read   This capital outlay will save you so much money that it will pay for itself in three years    So you keep buying things that will pay for themselves in three years  And after 20 years of doing it  somehow you ve earned a return of only about 4  per annum  That s the textile business   And it isn t that the machines weren t better  It s just that the savings didn t go to you  The cost reductions came through all right  But the benefit of the cost reductions didn t go to the guy who bought the equipment  It s such a simple idea  It s so basic  And yet it s so often forgotten   The hard choice that Buffett had in this situation was to continue to invest where he knew he wouldn t get return  or to shut the business down  If he didn t buy the new machines  competitors would  and he d be out of business anyway   This is the nature of competition in capitalism  As Peter Thiel said  you want to deliver something so clearly unique and special that no other business can keep up  or you will end up in this same place as Buffett   pouring money into a business that will never return your investment because you cannot capture value   Not All Revenue is Created Equal  A business s ability to capture value is a main input into it s valuation  remember how Google was valued at 4x all airlines put together   Ability to capture value is crucial to command a strong valuation and build a valuable business   The way investor Bill Gurley thinks about this is Revenue Quality  It s a new way of thinking about value capture  He wrote a great post called All Revenue is Not Created Equal  where he lists the factors of  good revenue  which will lead to a good valuation and a valuable business  They are also indicators of ability to capture value   One dynamic that is especially relevant to value capture is switching costs  If customers have reasonable substitutes to your product and it s easy for them to make that change  it s going to be much harder to retain all of your customers over the long term  which weakens your ability to capture value   Retaining customers for long periods of time is obviously a positive  Conversely  if customers are churning away from your company  this is a huge negative   With subscription models  a low churn customer is quite valuable  In fact  companies with excessively low churn rates  5  annually or less  are very likely to have price revenue multiples in the top decile  Obviously  high churn rates are really bad for all valuation multiples   For non subscription businesses  customer switching costs also play an important role  If it is relatively easy for your customer to switch back and forth from your products to you competitors  you will likely have a lower price revenue multiple as your pricing power will be quite limited  On the other hand  if it is quite difficult for a customer to switch away from your product service  you are likely to have stronger pricing power  and longer customer life  which will inevitably result in better DCF dynamics   Switching costs can take many forms   technical lock in  data lock in  high startup costs with a new vendor  and downstream revenue dependencies are just a few  All things being equal  high switching costs are a positive for price revenue multiples  and low switching costs are a negative   Though Gurley does not specifically mention value capture  that is the core of what he s writing about  He jumps from the Revenue Quality directly to valuation   the connection between those is the concept of value capture   Gurley s post is a great read  blending financial and theoretical concepts into a new perspective on value capture   Pricing   The Test of Value Capture  A business s ability to capture value is most easily tested with one simple challenge  Can you raise prices without losing customers   My favorite thing that I found in doing this research is this quote from Warren Buffett   The single most important decision in evaluating a business is pricing power  If you ve got the power to raise prices without losing business to a competitor  you ve got a very good business  And if you have to have a prayer session before raising the price 10 percent  then you ve got a terrible business   There are a lot of lessons in these few sentences  He shows that a good business must have the ability to capture value  And  that the test of value capture is pricing power  If you re deathly afraid to raise prices  you do not have what Thiel would refer to as a  monopoly    you don t control your market   This is a test that Warren Buffett has understood for a long time  In this excerpt from Tren Griffin s new book on Munger  Charlie talks about some of the investments that he and Buffett have made that passed this test   There are actually businesses that you will find a few times in a lifetime  where any manager could raise the return enormously just by raising prices   and yet they haven t done it  So they have huge untapped pricing power that they re not using  That is the ultimate no brainer   Disney found that it could raise those prices a lot and the attendance stated right up  So a lot of the great record of Eisner and Wells  came from just raising prices at Disneyland and Disneyworld and through video cassette sales of classic animated movies   At Berkshire  Warren and I raise the prices of See s candy a little faster than others might have  And  of course  we invested in Coca Cola   which had some untapped pricing power   The thought exercise of the plausibility of raising prices in your business is an interesting one  It s a good way to force you to consider the strength of your competitive advantage  the barriers to entry of your industry  the quality of your revenue   all determinants of your ability to capture value    Explore Pricing optimization in the Evergreen collection on Pricing    How to Capture More Value  Abdy Mohamed contributed an excellent article from the Harvard Business Review by Professor Stefan Michel called Capture More Value   First  he explains why so many companies usually under invest in optimizing value capture  and how much is lost due to this oversight   Both kinds of innovation   one in value creation  the other in value capture   are important  But most companies focus only on the first  Sometimes a business can get away with failing to think about value capture if it sells plenty of its new offerings through existing approaches  But when value capture goes unexamined  money is usually left on the table   and sometimes the only thing that can save a business is finding a way to capture value   Yet even avid innovators often have a blind spot when it comes to value capture  They may assume that if value is created  rewards will follow  Indeed  one reason value capture innovation tends to be overlooked is that companies that do it well often simultaneously innovate in value creation  and the latter tends to take center stage   In the article  he reveals a framework that he developed showing 15 different ways to capture more value from a business s current engine of value creation  It s helpful to take a look at the variety of tactics available   Nespresso is a great example of one of the tactics  The margin increase of their coffee sales through re packaging the beans is wild   Consider Nespresso  which manufactures single cup coffee makers and the capsules used in brewing  Yes  the launch of such a handy appliance is an exercise in value creation  But any innovation that allows a company to sell  19 worth of a commodity  the typical retail price for a kilo of coffee beans  for up to  137 must also be celebrated for its value capture   The bottom line from Professor Stefan Michel  There s easy work to do  and a lot more benefit to be gained from some focused work on value capture   My work with more than 50 companies in dozens of countries has confirmed for me that businesses have spent far more time  money  and effort on value creating innovations than on value capturing ones   and that much can be gained by correcting the imbalance   Value creation is much harder to add as an augmentation rather than a first principle of creating a business or product   many of the determinants  competition  industry structure  are unchangeable  and these tactics can only optimize for the environment you re already in   Measuring the Moat   Fade Rate  There are two big papers that I came across independently in the rabbit hole of research  which both happened to be by Michael Mauboussin   Measuring The Moat is about  Assessing the Magnitude and Sustainability of Value Creation    a fascinating read  It is about 50 pages  and dense with content in the best way possible  it moves quickly and covers a lot of topics which all create an understanding of how value is created and captured   One of the most interesting to me was to see the comparison of turnover vs  margin  Some businesses capture value through massive scale and small margin  while others have created huge margin  consumer advantage  and can create return with much lower asset turnover   The most surprising thing that I learned from Measuring The Moat was about Brands  I often enter these research binges with a set of written hypotheses  and my hypothesis that Brand was an enabler of value capture was demolished by this paper   Interbrand  a brand consultant  publishes annually its list of the most valuable brands in the world  If brands are clearly linked to value creation  you should see a one to one relationship between brand strength and economic returns   This is not the case empirically  Of the companies that own the top ten most valuable brands  two did not earn their cost of capital in the latest fiscal year  and there is no clear pattern between brand ranking and economic return   So a brand is clearly not sufficient to ensure that a company earns economic profits  much less sustainable economic profits   Measuring The Moat is something I m very glad to have read  and already look forward to re reading regularly  It has a powerful set of ideas for evaluating the ability of a business to create value and capture it  by studying their industry and competitive advantages  Learning the methods of analysis in this paper  profit pools were a new one to me  have already changed how I think about assessing companies in their industry context   The second  much shorter  paper called Competitive Advantage Period explores the death of value capture  When and why competitive advantage fades away  and how to define and think about that eventuality  and it is an eventuality    Competitive Advantage Period  CAP  also known as Fade Rate  is a concept used by investors to understand how long an advantage will be relevant  and what kind of value the company will be able to extract during it s decline   A slow erosion due to competition has very different implications for a business than a sudden obsolescence due to a technological innovation   Both of these papers require a little patience  and tolerance for investor targeted writing  but they contain excellent information and ideas you won t see elsewhere on value creation and value capture   Red Queen Effect   An Unwinnable Race  There is no such thing as winning in business  there is only surviving  No Competitive Advantage is invincible or permanent  Thanks to Brent Beshore for teaching me about the Red Queen Effect as it applies to Business   Competitive Advantage is rare and short lived in the biological world as well  Indeed  it is exactly what one would expect in an evolutionary system  In biological systems  species are locked in a never ending coevolutionary arms race with each other  As we noted earlier  a predator species might evolve faster running speed  its prey might evolve better camouflage  while the predator might then evolve a better sense of smell  and so on  indefinitely  with no rest for evolutionary weary   Biologists refer to such coevolutionary spirals as Red Queen Races  named after the Red Queen in Lewis Carroll s Through the Looking Glass  It was she who said   In this place it takes all the running you can do  to keep in the same place    There is no such thing as winning a red queen race  the best you can ever do is run faster than the competition   All we can do is to create and capture the most value possible while we maintain a Competitive Advantage  Value capture is important to ongoing survival because it allows for reinvestment in the business to create a stronger competitive advantage or fund R D for new products  Living on thin margins does not allow for any lapse in quality of execution  and certainly doesn t enable a business to reinvest   Vincent Huang shared this great post by Peter Levine that explores Red Hat  who is having some of these exact problems because their model doesn t enable them to capture much value   There are many reasons why the Red Hat model doesn t work  but its key point of failure is that the business model simply does not enable adequate funding of ongoing investments  The consequence of the model is minimal product differentiation resulting in limited pricing power and corresponding lack of revenue  As shown below  the open source support model generates a fraction of the revenue of other licensing models  For that reason it s nearly impossible to properly invest in product development  support  or sales the way that companies like Microsoft or Oracle or Amazon can   If you re running a business with low value capture  you ll end up fighting someone with a much bigger war chest and more room to maneuver   Value Capture has many Enemies  Reinvestment  Red Queen  Technological Obsolescence  Commoditization  Competition  and plain old poor execution  We can t outrun all of them forever  all we can do is run hard and try to beat a few of the competitors,"[1221 82 752 432 1136 68 856 415 111 1317 1044]"

1238,training-dataset/business/1351.txt,business,How Startup Options  and Ownership  Works   Andreessen HorowitzOne of the things that struck me most during our recent pieces on startup employee option plans is how things that impact the value of those options aren t well understood  even if communicated or known at the onset  Many people reported feelings of a sort of  sticker shock   or reverse   on leaving their first startup  Meanwhile  founders genuinely want to do right by their employees and other stakeholders   but owning part of a company isn t a static  fixed thing  it s fluid  and there are a number of factors that could change the overall ownership equation over time   Part of the problem is the sheer amount and complexity of information required to understand equity and ownership in the first place  Which is why many founders are working hard to build trust while navigating shifting ownership   their own  their employees   their co founders   their investors   along the way  often dedicating resources to educating folks  There are also some great overviews  guides  templates  and tools out there now that cover how options and compensation works  So we thought we d share more here about how the economics behind startup options and ownership works   Cap Table  The capitalization or  cap  table reflects the ownership of all the stockholders of a company   that includes the founder s   any employees who hold options  and of course the investors  For most people to understand how much of a company they actually own  all they really need is the fully diluted share count  the broader breakout of ownership among different classes of shareholders  and a couple other details  The fully diluted share count  as opposed to the basic share count  is the total of all existing shares   things that might eventually convert into shares  options  warrants  un issued options  etc   Let s introduce a hypothetical example that we ll use throughout this post  Here s a new company that has no outside investors  and existing stock allocated as follows   If someone were offered 100 options  those shares would come out of the 1 000 share option pool  and so they d own 100 10 000 or 1 0  of the fully diluted capitalization of the company   But that s just the starting point of ownership  because any analysis of percent ownership in a company only holds true for a point in time  There are lots of things that can increase the fully diluted share count over time   more options issued  acquisitions  subsequent financing terms  and so on   which in turn could decrease the ownership percentage  Of course  people may also benefit from increases in options over time through refresher or performance grants  but changes in the numerator will always mean corresponding changes in the denominator   Financing History  For each financing round  of convertible preferred stock   there s an original issue price and a conversion price   The original issue price is just what it says  the price per share that the investor paid for its stock  This price tells us what various financial investors believe the value of the company was at various points in time   is just what it says  the price per share that the investor paid for its stock  This price tells us what various financial investors believe the value of the company was at various points in time  The conversion price is the price per share at which the preferred stock will convert into common stock  Remember   preferred  stock is usually held by investors and has certain corporate governance rights and liquidation preferences attached to it that the rest of the  common  stock does not have   In most cases  the conversion price will equal the original issue price  though we ll share later below where the two can diverge   The exercise price of employee options   the price per share needed to actually own the shares   is often less than the original issue price paid by the most recent investor  who holds preferred stock  How much of a difference in value depends upon the specific rights and the overall maturity of the company  and an outside valuation firm would perform what s called a 409a Valuation  named for a specific section in the IRS tax code  to determine the precise amount   Dilution  Dilution is a loaded word and tricky concept  On one hand  if a company is raising more money  it s increasing the fully diluted share count and thus  diluting  or reducing current owners   including option holding employees   ownership  On the other hand  raising more money helps the company execute on its potential  which could mean that everyone owns slightly less  but of a higher valued asset  After all  owning 0 09  of a  1 billion company is better than owning 0 1  of a  500 million company   If the company increases the size of the option pool to grant more options  that too causes some dilution to employees  though hopefully  1  it s a sign of the company s being in a positive growth mode  which increases overall value of the shares owned  2  it means that employees might benefit from those additional option grants   Let s return to the example we introduced above  only now our company has raised venture capital  In this Series A financing  the company got  10 million from investors at an original issue price of  1 000 per share   The fully diluted share count increases by the amount of the new shares issued in the financings  it s now 20 000 shares fully diluted  This means the employee s 100 options now equate to an ownership in the company of 100 20 000  or 0 5    no longer the 1  she owned when she first joined  But  the value of that ownership has increased significantly  Because the price of each share is now  1 000  her stake is equal to 100 shares    1 000 share  or  100 000   While not all dilution is equal  there are cases where dilution is dilution   and it involves the anti dilution protections that many investors may have  The basic idea here is that if the company were to raise money in a future round at a price less than the current round in which that investor is participating  the investor may be protected against the lower future price by being issued more shares   The amount of additional shares varies depending on a formula    Most anti dilution protections   often called a weighted average adjustment   are less dilutive to employees because they re more modest in their protection of investors  But there s one protection that does impact the other shareholders  the full ratchet  This is where the price that an investor paid in the earlier round is adjusted 100  to equal the new  and lower  price being paid in the current round  So if the investor bought 10 million shares in the earlier round at a price of  2 per share and the price of the current round is  1 per share  they re now going to get double the number of shares to make up for that  equaling a total of 20 million shares  It also means the fully diluted share count goes up by an additional 10 million shares  all non protected shareholders  including employees  are now truly diluted   By the way  this isn t just theoretical  We saw the effects of such a full ratchet in the Square IPO  where the Series E investors were issued additional shares because the IPO price was half the price at which those investors had originally purchased their shares   Ideally  anti dilution protections wouldn t come into play at all  That is  each subsequent round of financing is at a higher valuation than the prior ones because the company does well enough over time  or there aren t dramatic changes to market conditions  But  if they do come into play  there s a  double whammy  of dilution   from both the anti dilution protection  having to sell more shares  thus increasing the denominator of fully diluted share count  as well as the lower valuation   Liquidation Preferences  Some investors may also have liquidation preferences that attach to their shares  Simply put  a liquidation preference says that an investor gets its invested dollars back first   before other stockholders  including most employees with options    in the case of a liquidity event such as the sale of the company   To illustrate how such a preference works  let s go back to our example  only now assume the company was sold for  100 million  Our Series A investor   who invested  10 million in the company and owns 50  of the business   could choose to get back its  10 million in the sale  liquidation preference   or take 50  of the value of the business  50     100 million    50 million   Obviously  the investor will take the  50 million  That would leave  50 million in equity value to then be shared by the common and option holders   Given the high sale price for the company in this example  the liquidation preference never came into play  It would  however  come into play under the following scenarios   Scenario 1  If the sale price of a company is not sufficient to  clear  the liquidation preference  so the investor chooses to take its liquidation preference instead of its percentage ownership in the business   Let s now assume a  15 million sale price  instead of the  100 million  in our example  As the table below illustrates  our Series A investor will elect to take the  10 million liquidation preference because its economic ownership  50     15 million    7 5 million  is less than what it would get under the liquidation preference  That leaves  5 million  instead of the  50 million  for the common and option holders to share   Scenario 2  When a company goes through several rounds of financing  each round includes a liquidation preference  At a minimum the liquidation preference equals the total capital raised over the company s lifetime   So  if the company raises  100 million in preferred stock and then sells for  100 million  there s nothing left for anyone else   Scenario 3  There are various flavors of liquidation preference that can come into play depending on the structure of the terms  So far  we ve been illustrating a 1x non participating preference   the investor has to make a choice to take only the greater of 1x their invested dollars or the amount they would otherwise get based on their percentage ownership of the company   But some investors do more than 1x   for instance  a 2x multiple would mean that the investor now gets 2x of their invested dollars off the top  The non participating can also become  participating   which means that in addition to the return of invested dollars  or multiple thereof if higher than 1x   the investor also gets to earn whatever return their percentage ownership in the company implies  The impact of this on other stockholders can be significant   To isolate the effects of these terms  let s first look at what happens when our Series A investor gets a 2x liquidation preference  In the  100 million sale scenario  that investor will still take its 50  since  50 million is greater than the  20 million  2 x  10 million liquidation preference  it s otherwise entitled to  The common and option holders are no worse off than they were when our investor had only a 1x liquidation preference   But  if the sale price were the much lower  15 million  the investor is going to capture 100  of the proceeds  Its 2x liquidation preference still equals  20 million  but there s only  15 million to be had  and all of that goes to the investor  There s nothing left for common and option holders   Finally  let s take a look at what happens when we have participating preferred  colloquially referred to as  double dipping    In our  100 million sale scenario  the Series A investor not only gets its  10 million liquidation preference  but also gets to take its share based on its percentage ownership of the company  Thus  the investor gets a total of  10 million  its liquidation preference  plus 50  of the remaining  90 million of value  or  55 million in total  Common and option holders get to share in the remaining  45 million of value   In the  15 million scenario  the common and option holders get even less  Because the Series A investor gets its  10 million in preference plus 50  of the remaining  5 million in proceeds  for a total of  12 5 million  only  2 5 million is left for the rest of the shareholders   IPOs  There are a bunch of non economic factors   legal  tax  and corporate governance related issues   that we aren t addressing here  which stockholders are required to approve certain corporate actions like selling the company  raising more capital  and so on  They re important considerations  but we re focusing here only on economic factors in options and ownership   However  there is one factor still worth paying attention to because it s really an economic issue cloaked as a governance issue   the IPO auto convert  This is the language that determines who gets to approve an IPO  In most cases  the preferred stockholders  voting as a single class of stock  get to approve an IPO  Add up all the preferred stockholders together and the majority wins  This is a good check on the company as it ensures one person one vote  though each preferred stockholder has a say proportional to their economic ownership of the company   Sometimes  however  different investors can exercise control disproportionate to their actual economic ownership  This typically comes into play when a later stage investor is concerned that the company might go public too soon for them to earn the type of financial return they need having entered late  In such cases  that investor may require that the company get its approval specifically for an IPO  or if the price of the IPO is less than some desired return multiple  like 2 3x  on its investment   And that s how a seemingly governance only question quickly turns into an economic one  If an investor s approval is required for an IPO  and that investor is not happy with its return on the IPO  this control can become a backdoor way for the investor to agitate for greater economic returns  How would they do this  By asking for more shares  or lowering the conversion price at which its existing preferred shares convert into common   This increases the denominator in the fully diluted share count   To be clear  none of this is to suggest nefarious behavior on the part of later stage investors  After all  they re providing needed growth capital and other strategic value to the business  and are looking to earn a return on capital commensurate with the risk they re taking  But it s yet another factor to be aware of among all the other ones we re outlining here   ISOs vs non quals  and exercise periods   Besides the financing and governance factors that could impact option value  there are also specific types of options that could affect the economic outcomes   In general  the most favorable type of options are incentive stock options  ISOs   With an ISO  someone doesn t have to pay tax at the time of exercise on the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair market value  though there are cases where the alternative minimum tax can come into play   Basically  ISOs mean that startup employees can defer those taxes until they sell the underlying stock and  if they hold it for 1 year from the exercise date  and 2 years from the grant date   can qualify for capital gains tax treatment   Non qualified options  NQOs  are less favorable in that someone must pay taxes at the time of exercise  regardless of whether they choose to hold the stock longer term  Since the amount of those taxes is calculated on the exercise date  employees would still owe taxes based on the historic  higher price of the stock   even if the stock price were to later fall in value   So then why don t all companies only issue ISOs  Well  there are a few constraints on ISOs  including the legal limit of  100 000 of market value that can be issued to any employee within a single year  this means getting NQOs for any amount over  100 000   ISOs also have to be exercised within 90 days of the employee s leaving the company  With more companies thinking about extending the option exercise period from 90 days to a longer period of time  companies can still issue ISOs   but if they re not exercised within 90 days of exiting the company  they convert to NQOs regardless of the company s exercise time  at least under current tax law   M A  One of the most frequently asked questions about options is what happens to them if a startup is acquired  Below are some possible scenarios  assuming four years to fully vest but the company decides to sell itself to another company at year two   Scenario 1  Unvested options get assumed by the acquirer   This means that  if someone is given the option to stay with the acquirer and choose to stay on  their options continue to vest on the same schedule  though now as part of the equity of the acquirer   Seems reasonable  Unless of course they decide this wasn t what they signed up for  don t want to work for the new employer  and quit   forfeiting those remaining two years of options   Scenario 2  Unvested options get cancelled by the acquirer and employees get a new set of options with new terms  assuming they decide to stay with the acquirer    The theory behind this is that the acquirer wants to re incent the potential new employees or bring them in line with its overall compensation philosophy  Again  seems reasonable  though of course it s a different plan than the one originally agreed to   Scenario 3  Unvested options get accelerated   they automatically become vested as if the employee already satisfied her remaining two years of service   There are two flavors of acceleration to be aware of here  single trigger acceleration and double trigger acceleration   In single trigger   unvested options accelerate based upon the occurrence of a single  trigger  event  in this case  the acquisition of the company  So people would get the benefit of full vesting whether or not they choose to stay with the new employer     unvested options accelerate based upon the occurrence of a single  trigger  event  in this case  the acquisition of the company  So people would get the benefit of full vesting whether or not they choose to stay with the new employer  In double trigger  the occurrence of the acquisition alone is not sufficient to accelerate vesting  It must be coupled with either the employee not having a job offer at the new company  or having a role that doesn t quite match the one they had at the old company   Note  these are just general definitions  There are specific variations on the above triggers  whether everything accelerates or just a portion  whether people accelerate to some milestone  such as their one year cliffs  and so on   but we won t go through those here   Not surprisingly  acquirers don t like single triggers  so they re rare  And double triggers give the acquirer a chance to hold on to strong talent  Still  it s very unusual for most people to have either of the above forms of acceleration  These triggers are typically reserved for senior executives where it s highly likely in an acquisition scenario that they won t   or literally can t  not possible to have two CFOs for a single company for example  be offered jobs at the acquirer   and thus wouldn t have a chance to vest out their remaining shares   The simple way to think about all this is that an acquirer typically has an  all in price    which includes up front purchase price  assumption of existing options  new option retention plans for remaining employees  etc    that it is willing to pay in the deal  But how the money ultimately gets divided across these various buckets can sometimes diverge from what the initial option plan documents dictate as acquisition discussions evolve          As mentioned earlier  anything related to compensation and ownership boils down to building and navigating trust   whether it s through education  communication  or transparency  There s also an important S E C  rule that is in play here  Rule 701  the exemption for issuing employee stock options  This rule says that up to about  5 million in annual option issuances  a company must provide the recipient a copy of the options plan  and then once a company goes beyond the  5 million annual limit  it must also provide a summary of the material terms of the plan  risk factors  and two years worth of GAAP financial statements  Which is great   But times have changed  and the 701 requirements that were put into effect April 1999 have failed to keep pace  Companies are now staying private longer and are therefore raising more capital  often from new entrants to venture investing with more complicated terms  So simply reviewing a company s last two years of financial statements doesn t say much about the ultimate potential value of options  Rule 701 should be updated to better reflect the information people need to understand options   The good news is that if a company goes public  all of the above different rights that preferred stockholders have go away because everyone s shares convert into common shares  There may still be different classes of common stock  such as dual classes with different voting rights to protect founder driven long term innovation    but those don t impact an individual s economics   Startup outcomes are  by

1317,training-dataset/business/1042.txt,business,The Fundraising Wisdom That Helped Our Founders Raise  18B in Follow On CapitalTwo years ago  our team at First Round  led by Partner Bill Trenchard and VP Platform Brett Berson  began to quietly build out a program to help our founders navigate the choppy waters of follow on fundraising  Long had we observed founders caught off guard by what was needed to raise their Series A after having a relatively easy time at the seed stage  only further exacerbated by an influx of seed funding in the market   All together  we have immense knowledge in fundraising that we ve accrued witnessing our companies raise over 1 000 rounds and  18 billion in follow on funding  It s possible for startup founders to know more about almost every facet of company building  but fundraising is one area where we ll always be able to offer more experience   Realizing how well positioned we were to help  we built a program called Pitch Assist   a four to six week bootcamp for our startups that are getting ready to raise follow on capital  At the end of the program  they emerge with a well designed deck  a strong narrative  and a clear strategy for how to approach the fundraising process  Unlike normal fundraising advice  Pitch Assist is an immersive program where we advise  build presentations and rehearse side by side with First Round founders  Trenchard  in particular  has experience on both sides of the table  having started and fundraised for 5 companies before joining the firm   What follows is an inside look at how we run the Pitch Assist program  and what startups everywhere can apply from what we ve learned helping create fundraising pitches and processes for over 10 years   FIRST  FIX YOUR TIMELINE  Given the cyclical nature of tech and venture  there are distinctly good and bad times to raise capital   Avoid August  the second half of November and December  when many venture firms slow down  The year end holidays and summer dog days are dead zones for fundraising  so why set yourself for an uphill process  July can be slow  too  You can finish your fundraising process in late July   just don t start it then   says Trenchard   For businesses that have seasonality  it s prudent to coordinate your growth and fundraising cycles   If you re in education  think about the start of the school year  September is probably a great time to raise because your performance in August is ticking up  and by September and October you re on on a roll   says Berson   Keep in mind that you re having these fundraising conversations over a period of about 4 to 12 weeks  As you re fundraising  more data s coming in  The ideal is that data   whether it be user growth or new enterprise customers   is looking good and you re on the upswing  There are few better things than updating your deck with new data that s pointing in the right direction    TARGET THE RIGHT INVESTORS  A partner at a Series A or Series B firm will typically lead no more than one to three deals per year  a cadence that makes choosing a company to invest in a significant and emotional decision  Founders who understand this dynamic are a step ahead   Use the 10 90 rule   The reality   and difficulty   with fundraising advice is that it s not all created equal   There are two approaches  one for the the top 10  of startups and one for the other 90    says Trenchard   For the vast majority of early stage companies  raising capital is a slower  relationship building exercise  It may not be a competitive process  so your goal should be to to get one or two partners to fall in love with what you re doing  Running an aggressive  get every meeting lined up approach won t work as well for the 90  as it will for the top 10  of startups    In either scenario  it s critical that your fundraising process be organized and methodical  Never run an ad hoc process or be half heartedly fundraising  As a founder  you should either be fundraising or not   and if you are  it should be done with great intention   Of course  applying the 10 90 rule comes with its share of challenges   For many there s a Lake Wobegon effect  everyone thinks that they re in the top 10  until they realize they re not   says Trenchard   Given that there are two different fundraising tacks  this can have a major impact on your ability to raise capital    According to Berson  here are common traps that might trick you into thinking you re in the top 10  of companies raising funds   Inbound investor interest   It s understandable to think that momentum is building when an investor says   I want to get together  or  I m really interested   but set your expectations after you ve first met  regardless of the name on the door  This is especially true if the inbound is from a non partner   Just because a number of investors reach out pre Series A doesn t mean a deal is going to get done   Feedback from existing investors   By and large  it s not in your current investors  best interest to undercut your business  Unless they practice radical candor  they may sanitize their advice and mostly give encouraging feedback  Or they might just not know what s a fundable company and what isn t in the current market    One data point comparisons   It s tempting but invalid to do one off benchmarking  Saying that you re better than your friend  who just raised 20 on 80 for her consumer business  doesn t work  Taking a single  convenient reference point from your network doesn t mean that the same financing  valuation and success are at play  Fundraising is an incredibly nuanced process and it s often difficult to look at a few other data points and understand what they mean for your own prospects    Closing a seed round was easy   If a founder had several investors interested in a seed round or raised funds quickly  it s easy to believe that history will repeat itself  The reality is that nearly every variable may have changed  the market  the investors  the capital available   even the founder s ability  A Series A fundraise is a different mountain to summit    But we re a market leader   Doing better than your competitors doesn t make you a shoo in for the investor or round size of your choice  If you re the leader of a niche industry  you may have less growth potential than the smallest player in a massive or rapidly growing market  People often forget the  market  part of market share    Vet the portfolio  pick by partner   Founders that put in the time to research firms and their partners have an outsized advantage  Here s how Trenchard and Berson have seen savvy founders do it   Scan their portfolio for similar business models   Most companies will just look within their industry to see if an investor is a match  Yet  it s important to look for a similar business model regardless of sector  If you re selling to SMBs and many of the firm s companies do as well  the VC could be a good fit   says Trenchard   Take note of competitors   Of course  you want to be mindful of competitors in a VC s portfolio   adds Berson   If there s a similar business model in your industry niche  flag it and have that conversation upfront with the investor at the very first meeting  That s both because you don t want to invest time if the deal will be marked competitive and you want to take care of sensitive information that may benefit a competitor  Go in eyes wide open    Choose a partner  not a firm   Yes  there are great firms out there  but they re led by people  So  who at those firms makes it the right name for you   asks Trenchard   I really do believe it s partner over firm  The two are important   and it s great if you can get both   but let your primary hunt be for the right partner     Know each partner s perch in the firm   Track record and tenure make a significant difference within the hierarchy of a VC partnership  So it s not only about an investor s individual conviction for a company  but the juice the partner has in the firm  Take their number of months on the job and investment count as a benchmark   says Berson  Trenchard adds   Take note of the exceptions  I d suggest looking at track record across careers  not just a firm   If this is one of the first few investments a given partner has made  it doesn t mean a deal won t get done  but it certainly raises the bar significantly   Show the type of restraint that comes from research   Do you know what impresses VCs  It s when a founder says   We ve thought about this and we re not talking to everyone and their brother  We know you can make a difference in our business given your background in X and how you ve helped Y startup with its challenges  We ve done references on you    says Trenchard   Wow  Why do only 0 1  of founders do this  Take the step to call founders of startups that are backed by your target investor and do this before you re far along in your process    Choose your sherpa wisely   Your first contact not only  owns  the deal within the firm  but also likely determines how you ll be guided through it  So if you get introduced to a junior partner or associate  you may have a more circuitous fundraising experience depending on their internal influence   says Berson   You don t need to only talk to the founder of the firm or managing partner  but do choose your entry point wisely  That means not only who overlaps with your expertise  but also who is influential internally  Ask other founders who have recently worked with the firm for an honest appraisal of their first contact who ushered them through the process   Once you get an introduction to a given person at a firm  it s almost impossible to transition the opportunity to a different partner   GENERATE SCARCITY  Having been at both sides of fundraising  Trenchard understands that scarcity is a powerful tool  If the outcome of the 10 90 rule is to create the right relationships  generating scarcity is about prioritizing them  Founders should seek to create a feeling of demand without overloading themselves  as well as manufacture  fear of missing out  without making it a bad experience  Scarcity is your friend in fundraising  Here s how to hit that mark with precision   Fundraise like a surfer   plan to take on investors in sets   As a rule of thumb  speak to no more than five firms at a given time  regardless of where you fall according to the 10 90 rule  There s nothing worse than the perception of an over shopped deal  as VCs relish having the inside scoop on an exciting company  Group investors in batches to better evaluate and select them  like a surfer scanning sets of waves that move toward the shore  Here s how   Create groups reflecting a variety of priorities   Say you have a dozen partners at firms who might make a good fit  Don t group all your top choices in the first set of five  Pick two or three of your highly ranked VCs and round out the set with lower priority firms  Even if you ve rehearsed your pitch  you ll continue to refine it  so diversify your schedule to account for that learning curve  It s going to take some time in market to perfect the actual pitch  That said  don t leave all your top picks until the end as they ll be very out of sync with your process if in a later set  It s a balancing act    Structure the meeting days right next to each other   You want to kick off with each set of VCs with the same information simultaneously  If interested  VCs will generally move at a similar pace  If they aren t  they ll get back to you sporadically   some immediately  others weeks later   which is why you need to actively manage them in or out of your cohort  Ultimately  you want to maximize not only the number of offers  but also the chance they ll come to you in a similar time period    Use the back burner sparingly   If you have a lower priority firm that gives you a term sheet  you can hold them for a week to 10 days  but don t try to start a new process from scratch with a new set of firms at that point  It s enough of a challenge to coordinate a handful of fundraising conversations simultaneously  let alone ones in different stages of development  This is another reason to take time to sort  group and sequence your target investors at the beginning    Check your pulse   Especially for first time founders  it s easy to get tied to a fundraising strategy and timeline  Start the process with your first five VCs and regroup after the first week  If half of the first set are engaged  stick to just that set  If four of the five drop out quickly  prepare for the long haul and launch your second set   Given it s in an investor s best interest to give you a long drawn out  maybe   you need to read between the lines to understand their interest  Look for things like how fast they respond to you and find time for subsequent meetings  how quickly they give you clear next steps and ask them early for a clear understanding of their internal process   Before starting  nail the narrative with your seed investors   Before you jump into meetings with firms  make sure your seed and angel investors are working from the same storyline   Take it as a given that potential Series A investors will backchannel and reference check with your current backers  They ll notice if there s a well known Series A firm in your seed round that s not leading the next round   says Berson   The truth is there may be many reasons why that happened  so be sure to have a common message that all your seed investors rally behind  It s a big liability to just assume everyone will tell the same story    Make it a race   As a rule of thumb  schedule your first meeting three weeks prior to your first set of pitches  Your goal now is to get partners to hit the sweet spot between FOMO and disinterest  You want to get a term sheet  which is not only the promise of greater resources and runway  but a lever to generate a race dynamic    It s all about getting to a term sheet  Without one  you don t have leverage   says Berson   Ideally it s from your top choice investor for your ideal terms  but if it s not  a term sheet can be your negotiation tool  Without that  everyone is waiting around the hoop  A term sheet can create both a sense of scarcity and urgency    There has been some especially sound advice around creating a race dynamic  especially from Ted Wang of Fenwick   West  Here s his framework   The Horse Race  Think of this as the traditional way of fundraising  You ve got your list of targeted firms to fund your company  You identify who in your network can make the introductions and you release them at the same time  like horses out of a starting gate   The Rabbit  This approach is more like a dog race  where a mechanical rabbit is released and the canines chase it around the track  In this analogy  the rabbit is a VC with whom you met a week before the typical horse race  described above  commences  This can help move VCs along more rapidly   The Heads Up  This method refers to a poker scenario in which only two players are left in a hand after the others have folded  Two players  the VC and founder  are sizing each other up on what the company is worth  Wang elaborates with a sample exchange   Founder   I m going to go out and raise money  I really like you and want you to invest  If you make me a great offer  I will take it   VC   Tell me what you think is a good offer   Founder   If I m dumb enough to do that  you should not invest in my company  I m not going to negotiate against myself    In the  Heads Up  scenario  Trenchard strongly recommends that founders give a range for their desired investment amount  not a specific number   By declaring a figure  VCs can easily back into your implied pre money valuation by assuming 20  ownership  So always give a range  such as  5 to  7 million or  10 to 12 million   he says   There s one exception   and that s when the stars begin to align  ideal terms from the ideal investor  If there s an investor that clearly emerges as your first pick  reach out to say   Listen  you re my top choice  I m talking to others  but that ll stop now if we can do a deal at these terms  If you don t like them  I d still want to work with you  but will wait until the market tells me where the terms are before making a final decision   This is the rare case where it s okay to make a specific ask    THE WINS AND SINS OF PITCHING  Do not underestimate the impact of an outstanding deck and delivery  As Toytalk Co founder and CEO Oren Jacob says   A pitch is a live performance  You have to know it so well that it seems spontaneous   At the same time  don t let how you re pitching undermine what you re pitching   Here are key lessons and tactical tips that Trenchard and Berson have extracted from the thousands of pitches they ve heard and countless hours working side by side with First Round founders during Pitch Assist   Systematically surface all of the burning questions investors may have and that you have to know how to answer   At First Round  prior to the first Pitch Assist meeting  we have founders fill out a questionnaire to catch us up on what s happened in the business since the last time they raised  often their seed round   what makes their narrative unique  and what they believe their most compelling arguments are to date   Then  based on what the First Round point partner knows about the company and the Pitch Assist team s independent research  we develop between 10 and 15  Burning Questions  that we believe need to be answered before a startup should speak to investors  Today  we work with incredible designer Chris Laughlin and content expert Jared Bloom to run this process   Answers to these questions become a solid basis for the flow of the story itself  Our team actually prints out all of the questions  posts them on a whiteboard and then  as the brain trust talks through answers  takes notes next to each paper  These lend momentum  movement and energy to the responses  It also encourages concise  clear  relevant answers based on data    Most people  when they build a pitch  sit down in front of a blank PowerPoint document and start at the beginning  without really knowing where to go next   says Bloom   They spend an hour on it here and there until three weeks have gone by and they ve only taken one stab at the order of information  Our goal is to accelerate the consideration of all these options so you know you re ending up with the strongest way forward  and you always know what comes next    Any founding team can recreate this exercise themselves before they ever open PowerPoint or Keynote up    This is perhaps the most critical step  because it gets the founder thinking about their company from the perspective of an investor  Having that empathy with your audience is really critical if you re going to take them on a journey and get them excited about your idea   The critical thing is that the questions brainstorm is a safe space for founders to externalize any anxieties  sticking points  uncertainties and dreads  That way they can be answered systematically  You also want part of your braintrust coming up with questions to be uninitiated to the company and provide fresh eyes  As a founder  you might think something is obvious when it s anything but for the average person  And even though investors are often well versed in an industry or technology  your best bet is to describe what you re doing in a way that anyone can understand   While it s critical that your burning questions are generated by taking a hard look at your company and the market  here are some examples for inspiration   Your churn rate is high  why is that and what are you doing about it   The space you operate in is fiercely competitive  how are you going to differentiate and win   You have poor unit economics  how are you going to build a robust business   You seem to have a very long sales cycle  How does that impact the capital needs of the business and deal size   What is your ideal customer profile and how does that tie into your go to market strategy   Can you build a big business by only focusing on the long tail   If you re not unit profitable  is that by design  When will you be and what are the key levers   What are you doing to de risk the regulatory issues in your space   How did you arrive at your current pricing  What are the opportunities to increase it over time   Would it make more sense to focus on just one of your five revenue streams   If you have a comprehensive list of questions and answers to work with  you re much less likely to avoid simple  yet common  mistakes   You re sunk if an investor doesn t know what your company does 10 minutes into your pitch  There are a number of reasons this happens  but it s a founder s mandate to make the case for their company both simple and compelling   Sometimes it s jargon that gets in the way  but often the founder spends too much time on the market or problem being addressed   says Trenchard   Start with the basics like you re speaking to kindergartners  but advance your arguments quickly as if they re graduate students   Investors are pattern matchers  but they still need to be grounded in the fundamentals   Frame your problem in an original way  Find a very unique path to convincing them you re right and everyone else might be wrong   Here s an example from a hardware manufacturer of cell phones   says Berson   They teed up their pitch by saying that the world thinks about two types of consumers  those who are enthused by technology and those who are indifferent to it  Given expensive smart phones  they observed that most assume that consumers in the developing world are the second type of consumer  Their job was to create a product for a market where the consumer cares  but doesn t have money  I like getting a unique perspective in short order early on    Anticipate and address any objections   Draw from the concerns that your seed investors had during your last round of financing and weave in how you ve addressed them in your pitch  Force rank them from most to least prevalent  Then answer the most prevalent in that first 10 minutes of the pitch in an authentic way   says Berson   So  if you re Instacart  you need to bring up the Webvan disaster  for instance  Most investors come into a pitch with one or two big things that they think makes this business uninteresting  Know the objections and counter them early so you ve got the most engaged audience possible  As reference  Christoph Janz  the managing partner of Point Nine Capital  outlines a smart list of figures to have on hand to preempt due diligence    Don t bury your lead   It s a mistake to put compelling data in the last third of your deck  Make sure you include information that shows traction before the midpoint   says Trenchard   Describe the problem  your solution and the traction that shows that both are real  If there s more information that makes the business very attractive   from marquee customers to key partnerships   distribute that evenly throughout the deck  If you don t lead with the headline  you may feel the room start to unplug    The reality is that you may be their fifth pitch of the day  Structure your deck to not only deliver your information  but also to manage the energy in the room   Explain the customer pain point faster with emotion   In general  changing the energy in the room is your best engagement tool  Use humor or pull on heartstrings  Regardless of the approach  the customer pain has be specific and visceral for the investors   says Trenchard   If you re pitching Instacart  show the challenge of juggling kids and putting bags in the car  Most humans can understand that  But if you re freight forwarder startup Flexport  then show a bit more of why it s so damn hard to import from China  And then boom  Reveal a world where you can track your goods and get real time updates    Don t just have a dedicated competition slide   The best way to talk about competition  particularly if you re in a contested market is to address it throughout the entire deck   says Berson   Scrap your Gartner chart with its X Y axis and explain how   ideally from the customer s point of view   you re different and prevailing time and time again  So  for example  when you re on your market slide  address the holes in the market created by the fact that the competition is falling short    Put your team slide toward the end of the deck   A big speed bump for the momentum of a pitch is the mishandled team slide  First  I wouldn t put it at the front of the deck  especially because its biggest value is to demonstrate that the team is uniquely suited to tackle a problem  That full value isn t felt unless that challenge has already been explained   says Berson   Open with a quick  personal story of the founding team with very brief background and put the full team slide and explanation at the end  This will also help you avoid the trap of being 30 minutes into your presentation without getting to what they company actually does    Keep your slides simple and rely more on what you say   This is why rehearsal is so important  When founders know the exact percentage of the people that hit their landing page or click on their ad  it s more than impressive   it shows a strong commitment to knowing each part of the business   says Trenchard  Berson adds   There s a big opportunity to not put all the data on the slides  Have some on the slide to anchor the point  but then add color verbally with additional data and anecdotes    Make your appendix your arsenal   Here s a rule of thumb  if someone asks a question that has been asked once before  answer it on an appendix slide  If you have a sense that 20  of investors will geek out on quantitative marketing  make an appendix slide to reference so the other 80  don t have to endure a topic they care little about   says Berson   The major challenges to the business should be in the main deck  but cover all the secondary risks in the appendix should they come up in conversation    Don t stress about slide numbers   It s irrelevant if you have 10  20 or 25 slides  What s most important is to have a simplified  coherent story that you can tell in 20 to 30 minutes   says Berson   It s painful to see 10 jam packed slides  Give the narrative enough runway to unfold    Don t roll with an entourage   The founder or co founders should be in the room  That s it   and only if each is a vocal participant  I can t tell you the number of times we see four or more people file into the room or a co founder that speaks for 5  of the time   says Berson   Founders must show how they actively command a company  If your co founder is present but passive  there s an unintended consequence  You re signaling that you re not willing to have the tough leadership conversation with her    Pitch to your personality   It s supremely important to present in your own voice  Get inspiration   not templates   from other great founders  Find your voice by figuring out your own power alley   says Berson   If you tend to be geekier and more technical  then craft a story that leads with the numbers  If you re an extroverted leader  emphasize the people you ve recruited and culture you re building    Don t emulate Jobs or Benioff  Tell the story in your own voice  It s mandatory if you re going to get investors excited enough to squint to see a billion dollar business   Sync your timeline and your mindset   Founders must shift their thinking from winning customers to becoming the inevitable victor of a huge market opportunity that s unfolding  It s a very hard transition   says Trenchard   I ve only seen a few leaders do it naturally  For the rest of us  break from your day to day sales materials and really reset  That s what we do with Pitch Assist  In the first two hours  we conduct a  framing meeting  to identify the big story that needs to be told  The express goal is to crystalize a narrative at the right level   It s difficult for any founder to get out of the weeds of company building to the 10 000 foot view of storytelling  but it s critical to running the most successful fundraising process   That said  it s easy for the pendulum to swing too far  resulting in unhelpful abstraction   I think the biggest challenge of all is how to figure out how to bubble up your vision that s also not too high level  Pull out the universal from the ubiquitous   says Trenchard   I can t tell you how many times we ve seen decks open up with a chart showing how mobile s taking over  Every investor has seen a thousand of those charts and you unintentionally wind up looking unsophisticated  Instead  find a new way to tell the story that s oriented around the unique vantage point of the entrepreneur  and what she sees that everyone else just doesn t get    The catalyst for shifting your mindset and creating the right narrative lies within customer interviews   Normally startups have collected a lot of customer feedback while building a product  so this data can be revisited to really illustrate why customers  exact needs have been unmet before your product came along   says Berson    The real magic happens when you ve got an entrepreneur who can paint the grand story that just makes everything seem to inevitably fall into his lap   says Trenchard   But that originates from the juxtaposition of problem and solution  A lot of founders screw that up because they get into the weeds   or clouds   too much  and they miss that part of the story    The fundraising founder has to operate at the right oxygen level between the soil and the stratosphere  Not in the trenches  but not in rarified air   Exhibit unapologetic confidence  Jessica Mah  co founder and CEO of inDinero strikes the right tone when she says she s moved from being  cocky and arrogant  to channeling unapologetic confidence  When it comes to fundraising  that attitude strikes the right balance between quiet conviction and outright arrogance    Getting a vote of confidence takes  well  confidence  It s key to demonstrate that you have a great business  good numbers  and that you re going to get funded   says Trenchard   The successful founders are very honest and open about where and who they are   and  most of all  that they ll get the job done  The trick is that they show it in subtle ways    The components of unapologetic confidence can be boiled down to nuances  says Berson   When vs  if   When a founder says in a plainspoken manner   When we close  we re going to be   you know that they already see the money in the bank  There s no extra emphasis as they make the statement  but it s clear it s not in question   When talking about the future of your company orient around  when  and not  if    Near term clairvoyance   When a founder speaks about the near term  there should be real clarity  Investors understand unpredictability in the long term  but not waffling about what ll get done over the next few quarters    Demonstrated compatibility   Co CEOs almost never work  If there are co founders  each must step in to discuss their area of expertise and jurisdiction  If there s not a designated CEO yet  and one co founder grabs the mic at every question  that s a red flag  You want co founders that each contribute and speak in concert with each other  Or just choose one founder   the CEO   to run the process   It just doesn t work to have a meeting where one of the founders does 90  of the talking  If that s the case  there should only be the founding CEO in the room   Build credibility through vulnerability   One of the biggest ways to build credibility  particularly with early stage fundraising  is to be very open about what you haven t figured out yet   and to get ahead of it   says Trenchard   Admit you haven t figured out a channel or CAC  Be the first to bring it up  Every founder is scared of speaking about what they haven t figured out  But each founder that admits it earns major credibility points with investors because the reality is that investors will figure it out anyway    There are few things that are more important than your credibility as a founder in the fundraising process  protect it and don t destroy it  It s almost impossible to get back   Every business has its warts   Take Airbnb  Regulation is one of its big challenges as well as developing trust  Fleshing out how it s addressing the issue should be present in a pitch   says Trenchard   Demonstrate mastery not by being the god of a golden startup  but by showing you re aware of and addressing your challenges  That doesn t mean that you start your pitch with a download of every negative side of the business  Space it out and deploy information thoughtfully throughout the conversation   Saying   I don t know   can be one of the most helpful things you can do in a meeting and it s actually something First Round looks for in all of our founders   Overselling or hiding issues in the business always bites you in the ass  If the investor feels spun  you re done   Don t trigger the bullshit meter  In the push to create a race dynamic  many founders can exaggerate aspects of their business or the number of interested investors in their fundraising process  Here are Trenchard and Berson s warning signs that a founder is spinning rather than pitching   Quasi team members   Founders can oversell their team in the same way they might with their business  If there are holes in their leadership  they ll add key people who are yet to join the company  It gives the investor pause about the company or its founders if a star performer doesn t have the conviction to take the leap and join   This is also true for advisors  Most of the time  there s no need to discuss your advisors  The best investors are going to be asking why they re advisors and not full time team members  Leave them out of the pitch   Pipeline vs  customers   This is the slide that has a bunch of logos  only two of which are paying customers  The rest are on free trials  We see it all the time in enterprise pitches   If you have a great pipeline  you want to show it  but don t try to pass them off as current customers   Half truths and vanity metrics   This is a common mistake on the consumer side  A pitch may highlight an isolated metric  but when you plug it back into the financials  it doesn t look as good  One example is showcasing Customer Acquisition Cost  CAC  numbers that aren t fully loaded or attributed correctly  Combining paid and organic customer acquisition into one number is a great example of playing games with metrics that will undermine your credibility   Market size and competitors   Founders want to show massive markets  but they re at risk of doing so in an unsophisticated way  They throw big numbers that don t reflect their specific market in the near term  It s the same with competitors  We ll see an X Y plane with logos  but not supplemented with any nuance of what they re doing relative to the rest of the players on the field  In both cases  there s a lack of precision    Capital requested vs  capital needed   It s the top mistake we see every time  Founders default to asking for too much money  If there s no backing into that amount of capital  specific timeframe and deployment strategy  it s a direct hit to credibility    Value add platitudes   I d say 75  of the pitches we hear end with hopes to  find the right value added partner  or  we want to find a partner to build a long term relationships with and it s you   These are not bad messages  but they can come off as disingenuous if not backed up  I remember a founder who said   Listen  I m getting offers in this week  I don t know exactly where they re going to come in  but I really want you  If you do a deal at this price  we re done   The VC invested up to the mark and got the deal  There was no bullshit   just straight shooting    REHEARSAL REQUIRED  Even when we work with companies that are very large  top executives who speak publicly all the time still never want to rehearse  They ll say   Oh yeah  I ll just flip through the slides beforehand and it will be fine    that s heartbreaking because the final product could have been so much better  Practice is critical  and it s the part of the process that is the most easily overlooked  procrastinated and underutilized    There aren t any tips for getting comfortable with something that is inherently uncomfortable  You just have to feel the pain and do it   says Bloom   The worst thing you can do is go pitch in a real world scenario without rehearsing  have it go poorly  and then blame the material instead of yourself  But we see this a lot    To emphasize the importance of practice  Pitch Assist recommends that founders do one full run through of their pitch for every minute that their presentation is long  Sounds like a lot  but by the time you get to the end  you ll know it by heart and be unflappable in the face of adversity   The least painful path is to rehearse several times in private  and then slowly expand your audience  Get a few trusted friends together to watch you  Then after that  present to a few of your investors willing to give you pointers  You want to slowly push outside of your comfort zone as you get more confident  Schedule these meetings on your calendar as soon as you can  and keep your commitments  Even if you don t want a huge amount of feedback  the audience will be a forcing function to get you to run through it again and again  You have to put yourself in a situation where it s not game time but the stakes are still high   that s why pitching in front of your existing investors is so valuable   The goal should always be natural delivery   In any given meeting  a founder can be interrupted  asked to skip ahead or back  asked questions  etc  So  if you only know how to present linearly  anything unexpected is likely to throw you off your game  Knowing the material implicitly and organically will not only make you teflon in the face of these types of challenges  but will let you bring more authentic energy   In Bloom s opinion  being natural starts with understanding your personality as a presenter  Know both your strengths and your limitations   For instance  they ve seen a number of founders build really complex decks with a lot of fast paced clicks and animations  only to trip over them in their delivery  A fundraising pitch is not the time to dazzle with bells and whistles  It s the time to be incredibly clear    We might meet a founder who is really into the technical features of their product  and they love geeking out on it  so the deck should try to reflect that   says Bloom   Or maybe he or she really has more of a visionary bent   if that s the case  then they should lean into it as long as the pitch also includes the data investors want to see    If you feel uncomfortable presenting your deck  it s probably because it includes something that doesn t feel true to yourself or the mission of the company  Of course you want to try to weed this out earlier in the process  but that requires being very honest about your character  the people who work at your company  and why you re doing all of this in the first place   All that said  there are some people who are simply less adept at public speaking  and no matter how many times they rehearse  it doesn t get close to conversational  This doesn t mean they re doomed  says Bloom  There s one trick that can vastly improve their chances    Find the part of your story that you re most passionate about   he says   I mean  this is your company  You should care deeply about it  If you can hook into that feeling at key points in your pitch  you re much less likely to sound flat or wooden    PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER  In this difficult fundraising environment  the stakes are even higher  It s critical to first establish a timeline that gives a clear three month runway that aligns with both your company s growth cycle and the traditional venture capital calendar  Founders should run diligence to prioritize and vet each venture firm  but ultimately be guided by a partner s profile   One should self assess via the 10 90 rule  which will impact your fundraising schedule and how you create a race dynamic  As Series A VCs make only a few bets a year  never has avoiding the pitfalls during pitches been more crucial to sidestep  and the funding tips more vital to follow  Ultimately  all this preparation is to get a term sheet to secure the best possible partner and price    The reality is that there s a growing gulf between early stage rounds  so any enhancement to the Series A fundraising process might make the difference for an investor   says Trenchard   For Series A in particular  if there s not a clear next chapter of the story being written and a cohesive team being built  you re in hot water  Because there s less squinting for a glimmer of greatness at that growth stage  there has to be a sense of something special at play  For a series A partner  the ultimate success of your company may still be a coin flip  As a founder  don t let your pitch make it one    Photography by Bonnie Rae Mills,"[1317 1044 842 545 856 1136 14 512 1211 161 1]"
1350,training-dataset/business/1185.txt,business,Why Your Equity Split Could Kill Your CompanySplitting equity with your startup s co founder s  is an awkward yet essential part of establishing a successful business partnership  However  if not done right  the equity split you choose can have devastating consequences on the future of your startup  And that s why Mike Moyer  Managing Director  Lake Shark Ventures  has outlined some of the considerations that founders must remember when splitting equity   Founder disputes can wreak havoc on a startup company and few issues are more vulnerable to disagreements than the division of equity  At the core of the problem is the fact that most teams default to  fixed  splits in which equity is doled out to participants at the outset of the venture in pre determined percentages in anticipation of future contributions  The most common fixed split is an equal split  but sometimes founders use unequal splits based on a number of factors such as estimates of future commitment in terms of money and time and ideas  Next  founders slap on a time based vesting schedule  just in case   and they are off to the races  This style of equity split could kill your company because the next conversation about equity is probably going to be a fight about equity  I call this the  Fix   Fight  model for equity splits   Things Always Change  You and your cofounders will fight when actual commitment levels of time   money differ from what was originally anticipated  You will fight when you bring on new people and you will fight when someone leaves  Each fight will end in unpopular compromises that will take a toll on interpersonal relationships  When new agreements can t be reached  in come the lawyers  Start up lawyers are all too familiar with this story and it rarely ends well  There is a better way  however   Startups are a Gamble  Think of your startup as a game of Blackjack  You and a partner do a traditional  Fix   Fight  split 50 50 and sign an agreement with a traditional time based vesting schedule  You both place  1 on the same hand of Blackjack  You have no idea if you re actually going to win  Different hands may pay different amounts so you have no idea how much you re going to win  Also  you have no idea when you are going to win as your game could have multiple rounds of betting  The future  in other words  is unknowable   The Dealer Deals Two Aces  In Blackjack  you can  split  the aces into two hands and bet again or  double down   You and your partner decide to go for it  but your partner is out of money  You re not  so you put down  2 more  Like before  you don t know if you re going to win  how much you re going to win or when you re going to win  The future is still unknowable  What is knowable  however  are the bets  You bet  3 and your partner bet  1  Does your 50 50 deal still sound fair  Probably not  It should be obvious that you deserve 75  and your partner deserves 25   Your share of the winnings should be based on your share of the bets   Of course  you signed an equity agreement and you are legally obligated to give him half  But  just because you agreed to it and just because it s legal doesn t make it fair  You should still fight it hence   Fix   Fight    Founder Contributions are  Bets   Startup companies are the same as Blackjack  albeit with lower odds   When someone contributes to a startup and does not get paid  they are putting their contribution at risk  They are  in effect   betting  the fair market value of the contribution on the future  winnings  of the startup which come in the form of profits or the proceeds of a sale  Just like in the Blackjack scenario  a person s   share of the equity should be based on that person s   share of the at risk contributions   Types of  bets  made by founders   Time  without pay or partial pay  Money  investments or unreimbursed expenses  Ideas  intellectual property  Relationships  for sales  investments or partnerships  Supplies  consumables  Equipment  computers  machinery  vehicles  etc   Facilities  office  warehouse space  retail space  etc   A Logical  Self Adjusting Formula  Basing equity splits on actual events rather than guesses about the future enables startup founders to apply a logical framework to the allocation and recovery of equity in an early stage company  This model  known as Slicing Pie  provides a standard equity formula for all startups where founders put their contributions at risk  The formula self adjusts over time and terminates at breakeven after all the bets have been placed  All splits adjust  Slicing Pie simply provides a logical formula for making adjustments and allows founders to avoid the fights   About Mike Moyer  Mike Moyer is a career

1363,training-dataset/business/196.txt,business,Board MembersOver the last five years  there has been an incredible shift in leverage from investors to founders  It s good in most ways  but bad in an important few  Founders  desire for control is good in moderation but hurts companies when it gets taken to extremes   Many founders  or at least  many of the founders I talk to  generally want few to no outsiders on their boards  A popular way to win an A round in the current environment is to not ask for a board seat  Some investors are happy to do this it s certainly easier to write a check and go hang out on the beach than it is to take a board seat  And this trend is likely to continue  because these new investors are generally willing to pay much higher prices than investors that want to be involved with the company   But great board members  with a lot of experience seeing companies get built  are the sort of people founders should want thinking about their companies every day  There are a lot of roles where experience doesn t matter in a startup  but board members usually aren t one of them  Board members are very useful in helping founders think big and hire executives   Board members are also a good forcing function to keep the company focused on execution  In my experience  companies without any outsiders on their boards often have less discipline around operational cadence   Finally  board members stick with the company when things really go wrong  in a way that advisors usually don t   Board members certainly don t have to be investors  If founders do choose to take money without an involved board member  I think it s very important to get an advisor with a significant equity position that will play the role of a board member  or better  actually put them on the board    Personally  I think the ideal board structure for most early stage companies is a 5 member board with 2 founders  2 investors  and one outsider  I think a 4 member board with 2 founders  1 investor and 1 outsider is also good  in practice  the even number is almost never a problem    As a side note  bad board members are disastrous  You should check references thoroughly on someone before you let them join your board   The companies that have had the biggest impact and created the most value have had excellent board members  and executives   I don t believe this is a coincidence   It s a good idea to keep enough control so that investors can t fire you  there are a lot of different ways to do this   but beyond that  it s important to bring in other people and trust them to help you build the company       Thanks to Mike Moritz for reviewing a draft of this,"[1363 33 545 14 779 286 687 1044 1317 1015 1]"
1378,training-dataset/business/798.txt,business,Overdosing on VC  Lessons from 71 IPOsVenture capital is a hell of a drug  Used properly  it s like adrenaline energizing many of the greatest companies of the past fifty years  Used incorrectly  it creates toxic dependencies   The conventional wisdom in the startup community is that when building the very best companies  more capital can be leveraged to accelerate even greater growth  But does this  go big or go home  approach stand up to scrutiny  In the best case scenarios  do companies that load up on venture capital actually outperform those that more efficiently deploy capital  We looked at 71 tech IPOs from the last five years to find out   Efficient entrepreneurship  At Founder Collective we ve been talking to our community about the virtues of what we call  efficient entrepreneurship   We ve written recently about the downsides of heavily funded companies  including the loss of exit optionality  and perils of unsustainable burn rates  but how does aggressive venture capitalization look on the upside  By studying the best cases of venture capital success  what can we learn about the benefits of raising lots of money   The results were surprising   by examining the technology IPOs of the past five years  we found that the enriched  well capitalized  companies do not meaningfully outperform their efficient  lightly capitalized  peers up to the IPO event and actually underperform after the IPO   Raising a huge sum of money is a requirement to join the unicorn herd  but a close look at the best outcomes in the technology industry suggests that a well stocked war chest doesn t have correlation with success   Of the 20 most successful publicly traded startups over the past five years  measured by current market cap   14 raised in the neighborhood of  100M or less  Six raised less than  50M  One raised no capital at all  These are shockingly small amounts of money when you consider the median privately funded unicorn has raised  284 million dollars   Methodology  Evaluating startup performance is a messy business  Late stage companies are rightfully secretive  Acquisitions are messy financial affairs often engineered to obfuscate the true value of a transaction  The IPO market was the most transparent proxy we could find  and while imperfect  it is instructive  With notable exceptions  most of the biggest outcomes in venture capital are a result of IPOs  By studying the relationship between venture capital and IPOs of the past five years  we can get an idea of whether raising more capital in the best companies correlates to better outcomes   The data  The data includes 71 companies that raised a total of  10 2B in venture capital  Their combined market cap is  566B  or 55X the capital invested  The average startup on the list raised  144M in VC to build a company worth  7 9B  The median startup on the list raised  79M in VC to build a company worth  1 8B Setting Facebook Aside  Acknowledging that there is only one Facebook and that it is an extreme outlier among outliers  we excluded the company from most of our analyses  Absent Facebook  the overall numbers still look pretty strong  but it is astounding to see how much one company skews the totals   70 companies that raised  9 6B in venture capital Their combined market cap is  202B  or 21X the original investment The average startup raised  137M to build a company worth  2 8B The median startup on the list raised  79M in VC to build a company worth  1 8B Exclusions    We only looked at companies that held IPOs between 2011 2015  It would be interesting to go back further than five years  but it is also instructive to examine what is effectively the  unicorn era  in which private companies raised unprecedented amounts of capital  We excluded companies that were founded prior to 2000  e g  GoDaddy  FirstData   companies with unorthodox financing paths  e g  Match Group  RetailMeNot   and companies in Asia and Russia  because they have significantly different financing environments  The result is a dataset  available for review  that includes 71 companies  Most of the data was taken from Crunchbase  except where noted   We also excluded late stage private equity  secondary offerings  and debt from the calculations  though they are recorded in the spreadsheet  We were less interested in the money raised in the IPO  as we viewed as a graduation point from the venture capital game and is largely a direct function of company size  The data certainly contains imperfections  though we did our best to get it right  and we re open to feedback on the dataset  which is why we re making it public   The best case for  Big VC   This data might suggest that  go big or go home  makes some financial sense  especially for investors  The most heavily funded companies do have larger total dollar returns  Counted together  the 20 best funded companies on the list raised  6 7B in VC and have an aggregate market cap of  62B  for a  9X return   The 20 least funded companies on this list only raised  623M in VC  yet managed to return  48B to investors  or an 77X return   That s a  14B dollar difference in aggregate returns  That s non trivial  especially to VC as an asset class  However    12B of that difference is accounted for by Twitter  who raised a little less than a billion dollars in VC  So aside from those Facebook and Twitter  venture capitalists spent   5B to make an incremental  2B  It s important to note that the stock market is volatile and that over the course of writing this post  the 20 most enriched companies have fluctuated dramatically  Still  the variance is usually driven by one or two outlier companies   It is true that there are a few companies founded each year that drive the bulk of the returns  It is also true that in the case of only a couple of outliers  Facebook and Twitter   heavily funding the best companies is a winning strategy for investors  However  It is not clear that VCs have been able to consistently identify the best performers and have instead overfunded even the most successful companies   This isn t a knock on the VC model it s an asset class predicated on risk  The best firms in our industry have shown an ability to run this high risk playbook over many funds   It should be a lesson for founders though  Companies like Facebook and Twitter are critical for the health of the ecosystem  but are not a good model for other startups  Unless a founder is very confident that they are building the next Facebook scale business  they would be better served focusing on creating higher multiples instead of a higher exit value   VCs have a portfolio  entrepreneurs get one shot  at a time   VC can afford to risk overfunding a dozen companies in order to be a part of the epoch defining winners  but entrepreneurs only have one shot  As a founder  are you willing to take 4X more risk for what  even in the best cases  results in a 24  premium  That s basically what the companies on the top of this list did   The median enriched startup raised  193M to build a company worth  2 1B  The median efficient startup raised  37M to build a company worth  1 7B  The financial calculus for founders is even worse than it appears  Incremental funding will probably come with extra dilution  and pre IPO preferences that will favor the VCs if the startup s hot streak falters and it doesn t get public  Beyond the magnitude or risk  more capital limits the number of possible exit paths  The founders of 20 most efficient companies likely could have successfully sold their companies at any point along their development for a healthy return  Their enriched counterparts are locked into billion dollar exits with diminishing returns on capital   Is this actually the best model for VCs   It s conventional wisdom in the VC market that investors should heavily lean into their winners  but are you better off doubling down on winners for diminishing returns or funding a new crop of startups with the potential to return 10  20  or 30X   Davids versus Goliaths  Though it s a ridiculously small sample  look at companies that raised an objectively large sum of money say over  200M  nine companies in this sample   versus an equal number at the bottom of the list  The results are staggering  The most enriched companies raised  567M to return  3 5B or 6X  The most efficient companies raised  12 9M to return  2 8B or 218X  The most enriched companies raised 44X more money to get a 25  better return  Less money   better companies   Market value at the IPO is important because it is often a marker of the venture capital exit value  but it s also interesting to consider how these enriched companies compare to their efficient peers in the long term as public companies  Does instilling a sense of fiscal restraint early  where growth comes from disciplined customer acquisition  not a venture capitalist s checkbook  lead to more sustainable businesses   It turns out the efficient companies have performed significantly better as public companies than the enriched group   Though it s a ridiculously small sample  look at companies that raised an objectively large sum of money say over  200M  nine companies in this sample   versus an equal number at the bottom of the list  The results are staggering   The 20 most efficient startups have appreciated by 89  since their IPOs Their enriched counterparts only grew by 22  in the same period     Our hypothesis is that too much capital over time creates a culture that substitutes cash for creativity and operational discipline  Big balance sheets allow companies to grow inefficiently  to paper over problems with headcount and spend  rather than confronting the core engine of value creation  Having less money forces a management team to make hard decisions early on and to cut off potentially wasteful problems that otherwise could linger indefinitely  This efficient ethos becomes part of the long term culture of productive performance that is difficult to infuse in the enriched companies that never operated in a constrained way   There is a fair counter argument that the enriched cohort had higher valuations at the time of the IPO and that the value was captured by private market investors rather than public investors  While possibly true  entrepreneurs and VCs should consider the implication of this argument is that public market investors may apply significant discounts to the increasingly large unicorn club that has raised large amounts of private capital prior to an IPO   Shouldn t there be a positive correlation   It s important to take a step back and consider how surprising this data set really is  The venture capital industry accepts as an assumption  that in the best outcomes  more money accelerates more success  Some would argue that it s nearly impossible for a true winner to be overcapitalized   these companies are reinvesting the capital into their success economic engines after all  Capital gives you the ability to make more investment in drivers of the business   talent  R D  customer acquisition  etc  Intuitively  it makes sense that enriched companies should do better than their lightly funded counterparts   We would have expected to see correlation in these numbers and be debating the embedded causality assumption that we assume in the venture industry  In other words  we d expect to debate whether the money caused the success  causality   but take for granted that the most successful companies were in a position to raise the most money  correlation with unclear causality    It s shocking that no meaningful correlation is present in the data  Although the best performing companies are in the best position to raise the most capital  they don t necessarily do so   With the exception of a few critical outliers  the better funded companies aren t meaningfully bigger or better performing and actually become worse public companies  VC is an outlier business  a vocation premised on volatility  but the fact that highly funded companies aren t clearly outpacing their cash restricted competitors shows there is a point of diminishing returns for capital even among the very best companies  The data suggests that VCs struggle to understand where that point is  The adage in VC has been that there are only 15 companies born every year that matter  If loading cash into companies is your game as a VC  it appears that there are only 2 companies over the past 5 years that actually mattered  That s a nearly impossible game to play   What about acquisitions   Looking at the data  15 of the 20 best performing startups of the last five years raised less than  125M from venture capitalists   We re including Wayfair in this tally  which didn t raise any capital for the first 10 years of the company s life and whose deal was more akin to late stage private equity   Four  Atlassian  Shutterstock  Textura  and SkullCandy succeeded with no venture capital whatsoever  Splunk and Palo Alto Networks  combined  raised approximately  105M and currently have a shared market cap greater than  20B  Groupon and Zynga each raised multiple  100M  rounds  nearly  2B in total  and are currently worth   5B   We know this analysis is imperfect  Some of the companies that IPO d in 2015 haven t yet reported four quarters as public companies and even if enriched with VC  might have more positive long term results  Still  this data should give founders and VCs pause  Though increasingly unfashionable in the unicorn era  it is quite possible  and perhaps even advisable  to build a billion dollar publicly traded company with under  50M in venture capital   Looking at the data  15 of the 20 best performing startups of the last five years raised less than  125M from venture capitalists   We re including Wayfair in this tally  which didn t raise any capital for the first 10 years of the company s life and whose deal was more akin to late stage private equity   Four  Atlassian  Shutterstock  Textura  and SkullCandy succeeded with no

rounds  nearly  2B in total  and are currently worth   5B   Capital raised is a vanity metric  Fundraising is a strategic choice that needs to be as carefully considered  just like your product roadmap  marketing strategy  or hiring plan  Unfortunately  entrepreneurs tend to make funding decisions opportunistically  or even worse  out of a sense of pride or false validation   If you re enjoying success  money will be thrown at you  It s flattering and having a strong balance sheet can be a good thing  but it does limit optionality and creates more difficult exit paths  Capital is rarely your biggest constraint or the biggest opportunity in front of you  Worst of all  the evidence shows that there is a limit to how much your balance sheet will help the long term value of your company even in the very best outcomes  Putting this data set in perspective  while the enriched companies underperformed  they were modestly financed compared to today s unicorns  Our median enriched company  top 20 in terms of capital  raised  193M before going public  Today s unicorns sit at a median of  284M in capital raised and they may yet need to raise more money to reach the public markets  Our data suggests that this is not a positive sign for long term success  Buyers beware   The point of this isn t to encourage bootstrapping  nor is it celebrating slow growth  We re not advocating a  Just Say No  position on raising venture capital   we re VCs after all  Though some companies are able to achieve huge success without fundraising at all  they are very unusual  Startups don t get bonus points for trying to build a company on hard mode   The founders of these efficient startups had the same ambition and hunger to build businesses as their enriched counterparts  They just did a better job of it  These more efficient entrepreneurs are building real  international multi billion dollar organizations with far less risk and likely own much more of their companies  The surprise in this analysis is that it appears likely that being capital constrained to some degree was helpful  not harmful  in that journey   This isn t an attack on VC   it s a celebration of entrepreneurs  The mystique of entrepreneurship used to be in the magical act of making something from nothing  Now  we celebrate founders who act like banks by raising huge sums from venture capitalists  We think this is unhealthy and needs to change  While the startup market has been flooded with capital  founders don t need to raise huge sums to be successful  and it seems that even in the highest upside cases  raising less money leads to better companies  Yet today  most founders are convincing themselves to take the opposite approach   We re making an argument for the efficient use venture capital  not against the use of venture capital  Venture Capital is an essential ingredient in the success of many startups  and there are rare times when adding huge amounts of capital is justified  But like most drugs  there is a time and place for their use and the side effects should be clearly noted to potential users   Our portfolio contains a number of companies that have followed the enriched model and others that were so efficient that they seemed fueled by the scent of a petrol soaked rag  The advice for both is the same  Think about how you would run your company differently if the money in the bank was the last you d ever get  The answer to that question could make you a billionaire   Featured Image  Fanatic Studio Getty Images,"[1378 1 398 751 752 470 711 774 545 182 1381]"
1381,training-dataset/business/167.txt,business,The Tech Bust of 2015Maybe instead of a tech bubble  we re in a tech bust  No one seems to fervently believe tech valuations are cheap  so it d be somewhat surprising if we were in a bubble  In many parts of the market  valuations seem too cheap  In the part where they seem too high  maybe they aren t really valuations at all  because the deal structure has changed to become more like debt     Many of the small cap public tech companies have taken a beating this year  Companies like Yelp are trading at less than 4 times trailing revenue   The tech mega caps are monopolies and have deservedly high valuations  But even then  I would not be willing to short a single one of Apple  Google  Amazon  or Facebook against the S P  Apple in particular trades at a single digit ex cash forward P E   2015 has seen the lowest level of tech IPOs as a percentage of all IPOs in seven years  The S P Tech P E is lower than the overall S P P E  Neither of these facts seems suggestive of a tech bubble   On the private side  people complain all the time about early stage valuations  and to be fair  they ve felt high to me for four years   But if you invested in every single YC company over the past three years at their Demo Day valuation  average Demo Day valuations haven t moved much in the past three years  you d be very happy  even though investors complain that YC is the worst example of overpriced companies   The mid stages also seem generally reasonable  though of course there are notable exceptions  These exceptions get all the attention not the hundreds of companies doing remarkably well  but that handful that have raised money at high valuations and are struggling or dead   On the whole  it seems harder than any time in the past four years to raise mid stage rounds  This is also not suggestive of a bubble   So where is the problem  Late stage private valuations  But perhaps the answer is that these  investments  aren t really equity they re much more like debt   1  I saw terms recently that had a 2x liquidation preference  i e  the investors got the first 2x their money out of the company when it exited  and a 3x liquidation cap  i e  after they made 3x their money  they didn t get any more of the proceeds    This is hardly an equity instrument at all   2  The example here is an extreme case  but not wildly so  Investors are buying debt but dressing it up close enough to equity to maintain their venture capital fund exemption status  In a world of 0 percent interest rates  people become pretty focused on finding new sources for fixed income   There is a massive disconnect in late stage preferred stock  because if you re using it to synthesize debt it doesn t matter what the price is  The closer the rounds get to common stock  a less than 1x liquidation preference  for example   the more I think the valuation means something  Unsurprisingly  the best companies usually have the most common stock like terms  and  the best companies  are never the ones that seem overpriced for long anyway    Some of this debt is poorly underwritten  Some unicorns will surely die  and those are the ones everyone will talk about   That doesn t make it a tech bubble  It d be more accurate to say it s a tech bubble if no unicorns die in the next couple of years   To summarize  there does not appear to be a tech bubble in the public markets  There does not appear to be a bubble in early or mid stages of the private markets  There does appear to be a bubble in the late stage private companies  but that s because people are misunderstanding these financial instruments as equity  If you reclassify those rounds as debt  then it gets hard to say where exactly the bubble is   At some point  I expect LPs to realize that buying debt in late stage tech companies is not what they signed up for  and then prices in late stage private companies will appear to correct  And I think that the entire public market is likely to go down perhaps substantially when interest rates materially move up  though that may be a long time away  But I expect public tech companies are likely to trade with the rest of the market and not underperform   But no matter what happens in the short  and medium term  I continue to believe technology is the future  and I still can t think of an asset I d rather own and not think about for a decade or two than a basket of public or private tech stocks   Thanks to Jack Altman  Patrick Collison  Paul Graham  Aaron Levie  Geoff Ralston  and Ali Rowghani for reading draft of this    1  There are real problems with these distorted  valuations   Employees these companies hire often think of them as real valuations  It also often makes the company think of itself as much bigger than it is  and do the wrong things for its actual stage  Finally  too much cheap money lets companies operate with bad unit economics and cover up all sorts of internal problems  So I think many companies are hurting themselves with access to easy capital    2  Even before the shift to debt like rounds  the disconnect between how much people will pay for 5  of a company in preferred stock vs  100  of a company in common stock was massive  and for good reason  the downside protection alone with preferred stock makes it much different than common stock   As this delta has accentuated  the public private disconnect has gotten worse  and caused a number of problems for companies accustomed to valuations always going up,"[1381 473 774 1033 1 711 1378 848 545 470 1238]"
