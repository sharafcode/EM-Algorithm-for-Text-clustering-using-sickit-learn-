Founder Institute  outlines six important tips for companies who want to cultivate a culture of innovation  and why innovation is essential for growth   Creating a culture of innovation within a company can be the key to its success  When innovation is lacking  it can cause valuable employees to become restless and can hurt business revenue  It s critical that companies implement necessary initiatives that will foster new ideas  in addition to ensuring that employees are supported from within  There are an array of topics that need to be considered in order to ensure that a company s mission of innovation is achieved   1  Make Innovation a Company Mission  The concept of innovation is often the primary focus of a company s mission and it acts as a starting point for measuring progress  However  creating innovation as a company starts with its leaders  as they will play a critical role in nurturing innovative ideas  When creating a mission of innovation  it is important to look not only at things that further the innovative process  but also focus on ways to keep innovation flowing through the company   Leaders need to put standards in place so that employees have something to strive for  while at the same time showing that they too believe in the power of innovation  There is a significant difference between claiming that innovation is the cornerstone of a company  and following through in creating a workplace that truly strives for innovation   2  Give Employees   Intrapreneurs Time   Space to Innovate  Often companies create a mission built on innovation  while at the same time not allowing their employees the time to develop innovative ideas  In fact  some of the most successfully innovative companies have structures in place that give employees more freedom to experiment with concepts they feel will be valuable  One way to do this is to allot workers a certain amount of free time in which they will be able to nurture their ideas   For example  some employers will let employees take an entire day off from their normal schedule to come up with ideas  so long as they can show they have been productive  regardless of the eventual outcome  Still  other companies allow employees to use 10  of their work week to dedicate towards innovation  In any case  this helps workers by alleviating unnecessary pressures   3  Understand What Kind of Innovation is Useful for the Company  A problem often encountered when trying to create a culture of innovation is a misallocation of ideas that will not be useful for the company  This can occur when companies disregard changes in the industry  neglect intuitive ideas from employees  and dismiss customer feedback  To counter this  it is vital to determine the kind of innovation that is useful for the company   Perhaps the best way to do this is to listen to the customers  as their input can be extremely valuable as to the direction a company should go  Customers are keen on innovative ideas which they would like to see implemented  and taking their suggestion and opinions to heart could help ensure that a company is coming up with innovative ideas that will help further company growth and expand its user base  After all  customers are the ones buying the products  so they know which changes they would like to see   And while customer input is invaluable  there are other performance metrics to consider  however  these will be different for each specific case  At times  picking a single metric on which to concentrate can help keep the focus on a particular facet  instead of allowing the results to be skewed by concentrating on too many variables   4  Move Fast   Test Ideas  Innovative ideas are wonderful when they pay off  but there are many times when concepts fail to gain traction and the result is time wasted on a fruitless endeavor  To counter this  it is imperative that a company move quickly to create innovative ideas  and put them into play so that they can be tested for feasibility   A driving force in the innovative process is market research and analysis  and these can help provide valuable insight into which projects should be given the green light  and which ones should be scrapped to make way for incoming ideas  However  these are not the only tools that should be relied upon to determine steps toward innovation   Human intuition can supersede what the data is saying  and there are times where one must rely on gut feelings to determine implementation of an idea  With this said  it is still critical to test ideas and get other s opinions  as testing is the only way to prove an idea is successful   5  Foster Collaboration Between Employees   Departments  Collaborating with other employees and departments can lead to expanded innovation and insight from all levels within a company  In large companies  there are often many different levels of management and this can work against the ability of the company to be innovative  Innovative ideas are sometimes left by the wayside because employees are weary of showing them to management for fear they will be shot down   By breaking down the barriers between management  and creating a company in which employees share a similar level of responsibility  will allow employees to communicate without the worry of pleasing management  Instead of having management meetings where employees are left out of the conversation  which can leave them feeling like they are out of the loop  Have meetings where all of the staff can brainstorm in a collaborative environment without fear of being ostracized  These habits can greatly improve the fostering of innovative ideas   6  Continuously Recognize   Celebrate the Innovative Culture You ve Developed  Rewarding employees for their contributions is essential in creating an innovative company  In addition  rewards can go a long way in increasing morale and they will keep people motivated  If employees do not have the incentive to perform  it can cause the collaborative process to stall  And while giving a singular award to an employee can act as a temporary incentive  this will not last forever  and eventually  the incentive will be forgotten  Therefore  it is important that companies continuously celebrate contributions to maintain an innovative culture   It s been found that in many cases employees respond more to rewards that encompass the entire collaborative unit  and not just a single individual  After all  there are typically many workers involved in bringing innovative ideas into existence  and rewarding a single member does not make sense  It is also vital to celebrate failed ideas to show that the company is supportive no matter the outcome  so long as the employee is attempting to make the company more successful   Final Thoughts  There is no doubt that innovation is vital for a company to remain competitive  and therefore  the fostering of innovative ideas should be a priority  And while innovation is always desired  the steps to achieve it are sometimes confusing and this can work against an employer  When striving to create a collaborative environment  a company must recognize the importance in allowing workers to use their own intuitions as to the innovations that are beneficial to the company  while rewarding them for any legitimate attempt at innovation  By taking the time to ensure that the proper steps are taken  a company can count on being a leader in innovation   Creatively Bold  Humbly Priced  Designli offers fixed price

179,training-dataset/product/60.txt,product,Change or die  what big business can learn from start ups about internal innovation74 Flares 74 Flares    What s the single key advantage that start ups consistently hold over big businesses  One which allows them to move faster  and change course quicker than large corporations   It isn t talent or creativity  and it s certainly not resources  Start up nimbleness comes from employee empowerment   a culture where people at all levels of the organization feel free to think  behave  control  and improve their work autonomously   Start ups have to be agile to survive  Since they aren t sure what will work in the marketplace  they are forced to try various different angles to find the right way to solve problems  market  and sell  The same cannot always be said for larger  more established companies who have been executing the same way for decades  These companies often struggle to adapt and evolve as they are stuck in the rut of their existing processes  resistant to changes  and have a more rigid decision making hierarchy   So how can large organizations take a page out of the start ups  book by sparking a cultural transformation from the bottom up  and empowering their workers   as individuals   to make change   Staying alive  With added competition from millions of new start ups  globalization and other new market seeking enterprises  large organizations lay themselves open to difficulty unless they are open to change  You only need to look at the numbers  In 1958 the average lifespan of a S P 500 company was 58 years  today the average is less than 18   The only way to survive is to continuously transform into something else  but many large companies are so focused on upholding and improving their  bread and butter  core business  that they spend no time exploring or experimenting upon other opportunities  Borders went under because they were too busy focusing on selling more books in bookstores rather than exploring the way the market was moving towards the internet  e readers and a more boutique retail experience   Of course innovation is important in the corporate landscape  but the idea that it boils down to culture is a new idea  To date  innovation is often left to a chosen few inside labs or incubators  often referred to as the Skunk Works Model  instead of empowering employees throughout an organization to identify and pursue projects beyond the existing business model   To break out of stagnant processes  and truly motivate a more  bottom up  flow of ideas  I believe corporates need to change their internal structure  and put in place a system where employees are educated  enabled and empowered to think and work in new ways   1  Educate  Teach your staff a new way of working  A key component of the popular process of design thinking is creating empathy between employees and customers  However  a common problem with this approach is that while teams learn much about their customers  they still fail to take sucessful action on their insights   One of the first steps to creating a bottom up flow of ideas is forcing dialogue between teams  offering them insight into parts of the company other than their own  and allowing them to  step into the shoes  of other teams  At established companies you will regularly find that personnel have spent years working in the same job  and have no idea what other departments day to day work consists of and how they contribute to creating value for the end customer  The same goes for executives and the C suite   At the root of a culture that enables entrepreneurial action amongst all employees is the desire to think independently  and take action to meet an end goal or improve a process  and having the skills to do so  One without the other doesn t really work  I believe it is important for companies of all shapes and sizes  but especially larger scale enterprises  to educate their individual team members that they  can  and  should  put ideas into action  regardless of whether they are in a management position or not   Aaron Eden  prior to co founding Moves the Needle  started a series of successful Lean StartIn workshops which were designed to help teams learn how to use the Lean Startup methodology to rapidly test the viability of their ideas   Intuit  for example  had been making a big investment into driving innovation  It was certifying internal innovation catalysts and consistently running design thinking workshops  Unfortunately  teams were getting stuck in  empathy land   They had interacted with customers  but were unsure about how to turn their new found insights into business impact   After taking Intuit s teams through a Lean Startup workshop  Aaron Eden felt that taking them through a rigorous hands on bootcamp could be the key to turning those insights into impact  In the bootcamps  teams would choose ideas  identify the riskiest assumptions  and run rapid experiments to make decisions and guide next steps with evidence   In just over 100 days  Intuit was able to help create 100 internal start ups that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in impact thanks to the insights generated and ideas implemented  Not only were people learning new skills  but they were motivated to turn those skills into action  It started a transformation within Intuit  which is now regularly named as one of the world s most innovative large organizations   2  Enable  Build systems and mechanisms to support employees  entrepreneurial action  After teaching employees how to work in a way that supports new value creation  you then have to develop systems and mechanisms that allow and encourage this newfound entrepreneurial spirit to flourish   Ideas can become severely bottlenecked and new skills wasted if the systems that enable innovation are not put in place  After surveying Intuit employees  Aaron learned that most employees who went through a Lean StartIn workshop felt as if their day to day business teams were slow and lacked initiative  They had seen the light  but were back in an environment that was locked into business as usual  At that time  there were no systems in place to exercise the newly developed skills in day to day work  Since then Intuit has made strides to identify customer benefit metrics for various teams so that they focus on activities that create new value for their customers   Humana  the Fortune 100 insurance company  is a prime example of a large corporation that has successfully put systems in place that enable entrepreneurial action    Humana was able to move from education into enablement rather swiftly  After doing a series of bootcamps that taught employees how to tactically apply lean innovation methodology to everyday work  the company created a Consumer Experience Lab under the helm of Geeta Wilson  In the lab  developing customer empathy  focusing on their problems and rapidly experimenting with solutions are the norm  not the exception   The Consumer Experience Lab has created an environment that enables employees to deploy their newly learned skills  and channel their entrepreneurial spirit to unlock massive value  Within the first year they created  10 million in new value for the organization through running experiments on ways to improve customer service   3  Empower  Transform the culture so the discovery and creation of new value is business as usual   Once employees have the skills and support structure they need to create new value  the final step is to empower employees throughout the organization to act like entrepreneurs   Empowering employees often involves breaking down the rigid  top down  hierarchies which are in place  While a company will always need managers  they need to facilitate and incorporate suggestions and ideas from all stages of the ladder  not just the commands coming from above  Providing employees with autonomy   and accountability   makes them more motivated to achieve results  and make positive changes   Barry O Reilly  a principal at software design consultancy Thoughtworks  says   Culture comes from the top  It is up to leadership to define and enact the behaviours that make people feel empowered to innovate and experiment  Pushing down authority is an enabler and empowering teams to come up with their own solutions to solve business problems can give rise to wider innovations    Rather than inciting a short term burst of innovation in the aftermath of workshops  enabling and empowering employees to be innovative should become an integral part of the company s culture and values   Innovation through internal mentorship  Even if a team has not gone through a workshop  team members and managers alike should  mentor  and support other members of the team  One means of doing this is by encouraging  internal mentorship  between colleagues   Established molding company RJG Inc  went through an lean innovation accelerator  where RJG staff were pushed to build customer empathy  run rapid experiments  and make decisions based on evidence  They came up with a new product design after building empathy with their end clients through a series of customer interviews and onsite visits  After continued experimentation they started getting purchase orders and functional prototypes in the hands of customers in under a year compared to the company s typical six year product cycle   Internally  people saw the benefits from working this way and wanted in  People who had never gone through the experience were running experiments while receiving guidance from their more experienced colleagues   The new way of working was not merely becoming the norm for a select few  but rather the entire business culture was shifting  Employees didn t feel the need to seek out permission to run experiments on new ideas because the culture empowered them to do so   Some large companies are going a step further to demonstrate to employees that they are able to  and encouraged to be innovative   Adobe rolled out the  Adobe Kickbox  program  which offers any employee the chance to be an innovator  As part of the scheme  employees get access to a  kickbox    a red paper box containing  1 000 of seed money  instructions for Adobe s six step innovation process and other innovation tools   that intrapreneurs are free to use to test new product ideas   Since rolling out the scheme  Adobe has handed out more than 1 000 red boxes to employees around the world  By focusing on the people  and not the outcome  Adobe has found a means of incubating thousands of new ideas from within  Other large companies like Mastercard have since followed suit   While offering cash to each employee might not be the right answer for all companies there is a lesson to be taken from Adobe s plan  Using the idea of  educate  enable  empower   all large stage companies can break down the internal barriers to innovation by showing every employee that their they really can make changes  and put great ideas in motion   Corporate leaders know their organizations must move faster  be more agile and act bolder  But just saying it  doesn t make it so  Trumpeting  be bold   without fostering an environment that makes it safe to work differently results in fear  not innovation,"[179 70 1088 403 110 592 228 625

196,training-dataset/product/1401.txt,product,Product Management is Culture Management89 Flares 89 Flares    Or  How to Manage Software Development in Teams who Think Nothing Like you    Product management has two diversity problems  The first one is well acknowledged  our industry must have more women  other ethnicities  and better representation from LGBTQIA  The second is more subtle  in those instances when we do achieve diversity  and especially cross cultural diversity  we are unable to handle it   The World is Flat  Our current reality is vastly different from what we ve seen even 10 years ago   The world is flat   as American author Thomas Friedman put it  And no matter how many walls we build or how hard we try to curb immigration  we are forever bound to work with people who are nothing like us culturally  Cultural homogeneity in product teams is dead  welcome cultural diversity   Our engineers and designers can come from anywhere  yet everything we learn about product management focuses on teams that consist mostly of white Westerners  Product rituals like standups  backlog grooming meetings  and retrospectives work well for people brought up in typical egalitarian Western cultures like the US  Canada  and the UK  Yet those same tried and true activities  which do miracles to help Western teams express feedback and discuss ideas  fall remarkably short when applied to people whose culture prescribes them to make suggestions indirectly or in private  If you ve ever tried to run a typical Agile retrospective with a team where one of the engineers is from China  you know what I mean  It simply doesn t work   We re Trapped in our Cultures  Every day  I lead a product standup for a team of four engineers  Syrian  Chinese  Ukrainian  and Singaporean Chinese  The Ukrainian engineer has lived in Japan since he was six  an experience which has made him bi cultural  The Syrian and Chinese have both spent several years in Singapore  a melting pot of Southeast Asian cultures  Sometimes  a soft spoken Indonesian UX strategist joins us  together with a Canadian Head of Product  an energetic American VP of Engineering  and a CEO from New Zealand  And then there s me  their Russian product manager who was born in Poland  raised in Russia  and then studied in Japan  How s that for a mini UN   The Singapore based company where I now work employs people from over 20 countries  This sounds great in theory  but in practice our cross cultural environment is a perfect breeding ground for conflicts  Consider a Thai software engineer who got offended by a Russian American engineer s comment on his pull request and then refused to work with him ever again  Or a UI designer from a low conflict Southeast Asian culture who overheard two product managers arguing about the UI copy  thought they were having a dangerous work conflict  they weren t   and raised it as a concern to their manager   Although many of us who have lived and worked abroad love to think of ourselves as cosmopolitan and culture agnostic  we are anything but  Even when some of us change countries during childhood or adolescence  becoming Adult Third Culture Kids  or have parents from different cultures  we absorb the cultures in which we socialize  We are never fully culturally homogeneous  Our personal style may take equally from our parents  cultures  from the cultures of students in our international high school  and the country where we work   Although many of us who have lived and worked abroad love to think of ourselves as cosmopolitan and culture agnostic  we are anything but   The more international exposure we get  the more our individual cultures seem to fade away  But  like it or not  that is an illusion  We are still the ambassadors of our primary cultures  or the cultures in which we formed our identity  even if we don t notice it  In fact  there are times when we unconsciously expect our colleagues to talk to us in our own cultural language  and things get awry if they don t   Dealing With Culture  Product managers who work with cross cultural teams are in the crossfire  Our jobs require us to communicate  effectively   yet the notion of what s effective and what s not is entirely cultural  Where an American manager would appreciate straight answers and a healthy debate  engineers from Indonesia or the Philippines would expect a different approach   Unfortunately  there s no easy path to an effective communication style in teams where everyone is a cultural minority  I think the best path to making this work is to adopt behaviors that speak to each member of the team in a unique way  Finding each such way will require some work and experimentation  In fact  every time someone new joins the team  you might need to re evaluate things and start over  I certainly do   Here are five basic principles I follow to improve the way I work with cross cultural teams   If you follow a different practice  please let me know in the comments    1  Calibrate the Team and Surface the Differences  This is the most important principle I now follow  I only realized its importance after violating it and facing the not so pleasant consequences   The first step towards managing product development in cross cultural teams is to help everyone see their differences  This will give your team mates a benchmark of where each of them sits on a cultural scale  It will also help them realize that when each of them is a cultural minority  everyone must make an effort to adjust   Start small  schedule a team lunch and share life stories  When the team gets more comfortable and open to discuss cultural differences  you may want to use a culture mapping method developed by Erin Meyer  more details at the end of the post   In her work  Meyer greatly extended Geert Hofstede s well known theory of cultural dimensions  and created a tool that helps teams to calibrate on eight key dimensions  the way cultures give or perceive negative feedback and handle confrontations  how teams make decisions and build interactions with their boss  how different cultures perceive time and do planning  and several others   For instance  people from cultures like China and the Philippines may see open confrontation as a relationship taboo  whereas the French may encourage it  When teams aren t made aware of such differences  less confrontational team mates may start seeing their more confrontational counterparts as  rotten apples  and label them as bad team players  I recently witnessed a difficult cultural situation which started with a Western engineering manager firing an Asian engineer  Several days after announcing his decision publicly  that manager received negative feedback from other Asian employees about how poorly he handled the process and how bad of a job he did by making the firing public and not helping the Asian engineer to  save face   In contrast  feedback from Western team mates stated the opposite  they agreed that the manager was transparent and communicated his decision professionally   2  Abandon Leadership Colonialism  Some managers  and not only product managers  have this funny idea that practices and processes which work well in their home culture would work equally well in a cross cultural team  And when such managers don t achieve the desired outcome  they blame the team for not being willing to learn and adjust  Even worse  for not being skilled enough  What they misunderstand is that the way they used to operate and make decisions may not be productive for people from other parts of the world   You will have to work with them as a group on establishing a set of shared communication patterns and culture agnostic work rules   Abandoning leadership colonialism  or the notion that practices from your primary culture can be successfully applied anywhere else without substantial modification  is one of the first steps towards the better management of your diverse product team s culture  That  by the way  doesn t mean giving up and letting your team go rogue  This would be disastrous  especially when multiple cultures are involved  What it means is that you will have to find an approach to each member of the team and coach them individually in a way that works for them  You will have to work with them as a group on establishing a set of shared communication patterns and culture agnostic work rules   3  Don t Rely on Instincts and  People Skills   There are no shortcuts  and you won t be able to wing it just with instinct or empathy  which is something products managers rely on a lot when working with people  Empathy is simply not going to cut it   This is because the way humans express empathy is also subject to cultural differences  How do you know you re empathetic in a way that is culturally familiar to your foreign counterparts  Sadly  what looks like empathy to you might feel insincere to your team  I once saw how a genuinely empathetic North American manager got labelled as manipulative by his reports from some Southeast Asian cultures  Good  people skills  are intrinsically cultural  which means you can t trust your gut when working with cross cultural teams   4  Embrace Small Talk and Instant Retrospectives  If you want to find a way to work with each individual team member  you must learn the cultural nuances of their behavior  You have to become infinitely curious about what makes them who they are  Small talk and instant retrospectives can help you with that   Frequent small talk gives you a natural way to absorb the communication patterns of your team mates subconsciously   While you might be familiar about the appropriate way of engaging in small talk in your culture  you ll have to experiment and find what works for your team  Some will respond better if you start a conversation with a joke  and some would simply love to talk about what they had for lunch  Frequent small talk gives you a natural way to absorb the communication patterns of your team mates subconsciously   An instant retrospective  on the other hand  is a more formal tool  After every work meeting you could ask each team member two questions   did this work for you   and  how could I improve    You ll be surprised how much genuine feedback you get  and how fast you ll be able to improve   5  Crack a Book Open  The reality is that you won t succeed without some kind of training  For instance  psychoanalysts and counsellors who practise across cultures must be specially trained in cross cultural empathy  otherwise they might end up hurting their clients  Same applies to all managers out there  you will need training  and reading 10 blog posts won t magically make you a guru of cross cultural leadership   And even though not everyone will have an access to in person classes and workshops  plenty of resources exist to give you the necessary skills  Some of these are    The Culture Map  by INSEAD professor Erin Meyer  Coursera lectures on Intercultural Communication and Conflict Resolution and International Leadership and Organizational Behavior  plus many more classes on edX and Udemy   Become a Cultural Chameleon  Product managers should be a cultural  glue  for the teams  In practice  this means that you must learn to change your communication and leadership styles multiple times a day  All of the above are much easier said than done  and I hope that as more product people become exposed to cross cultural teams  they will share their observations and learnings on how we all could get better at working with people from different backgrounds   Update  both the Head of Product and VP of Engineering have left my company since I started drafting this post  My team composition has also changed  but it is just as diverse as it was   Tools and resources  References  The Culture Map  Breaking Through the Invisible Boundaries of Global Business  Erin Meyer  PublicAffairs 2014

228,training-dataset/engineering/40.txt,engineering,Three pillars of microservice cultureTemple pillars in Greece  source  GanMed64 via Flickr     One of the things that my API Academy colleagues and I learned when we were doing research for our Microservice Architecture book was that software and hardware are only part of the puzzle when it comes to assembling a successful microservices culture for your organization  It turns out companies that are good at microservice implementations also spend time architecting their company culture and  in many ways  the code and operating system details are less important than the culture details   This focus on culture and values can make some in the IT world a bit uncomfortable  The stereotype of a socially awkward engineer is a handy fiction for television and movie depictions of Silicon Valley  but the reality is quite different  As we point out in the book  the human resource practices of companies like Netflix and Spotify are great examples of the kinds of organizational designs that are an essential part of any successful microservice culture  And  while we found every company approaches the challenge of crafting microservice culture slightly differently  there are three aspects of organizational design that we identified as keys to success  communication  teams  and innovation   Communication  The role of communication is best illustrated by Conway s Law  which can be summarized as  communication dictates design   Basically  the way teams communicate both within the team and with other teams is directly reflected in the code they produce  For example  in the article  Architectures  Coordination  and Distance  Conway s Law and Beyond   Bell Labs researchers showed that things like hidden dependencies that can result in  unexpected responses  are introduced at the team level long before the code is written  That means designing modes of communication can be just as valuable as designing the code modules  The folks at ThoughtWorks even coined the phrase  Inverse Conway Maneuver  to emphasize the notion that companies can actively evolve and manage organizational structure to achieve desired results   Here are things you can do to improve the quality and immediacy of communications for your teams   Design boundaries  don t fight Conway s Law  Engage in up front design to produce clear  stable boundaries in your code modules and assign teams along those same boundaries  Acknowledge existing physical separation as a  natural boundary  for both teams and code  Make Conway s Law work for you  Try to maintain stable teams  even if the membership fluctuates over time   Communication tools  Provide lots of communication tools  video  chat  mailing list  wikis  to make it easier for teams to get to the right person as soon as possible  Most important  try to make it as easy as possible to create connections between teams   Decision processes  Initiate processes that require all decisions to be recorded and published for anyone to see  This helps remote workers to keep up when they can t be present and it creates a  syslog  of team actions and decisions for historical review   Every company we talked with mentioned the importance of Conway s Law in their team dynamics   Teams  That leads to the second pillar of microservice culture  teams themselves  While the story of how Jeff Bezos used  Two Pizza Teams  to help minimize groupthink is well known  only a handful of the companies we talked to were aware of the social science behind this idea  British social anthropologist Robin Dunbar s research into primate groups identified the importance of group size as a factor in managing cooperation within the group  As groups get larger  the amount of  overhead  needed to maintain cohesion increases  In 150 person teams  Dunbar s research estimates that almost 40  of the time is spent keeping the group in sync  But in teams of around five  almost no overhead is needed to stay on task   What can you do to increase the effectiveness of your teams   Aim for Dunbar level 1 or 2 teams  Dunbar s team size observations  teams of 5  15  50  and 150  show that there is less overhead and better communication in small groups  Work to arrange teams on the low end of this series and  if you need to work with larger groups  break them into small sub teams in order to reduce the overhead   Autonomy within teams  Give each team as much autonomy as safely possible  Allow them to decide how things work within the team as long as it doesn t adversely affect other teams  And  with autonomy comes responsibility  Be sure teams own their product and take responsibility for its entire lifecycle   including post release support   Rely on team interoperability  eliminate dependencies  While teams have autonomy within their own group  it is important that they interoperate well with other teams in the company  Stateless interop  not tight integration  is the goal  Teams should not be allowed to break other teams  code  and teams should not have to wait on each other in order to do a production release   All of the companies we talked to for the book were working with team sizes of around 5 to 12 well within Dunbar s efficiency predictions   Innovation  Finally  the reason communication and team dynamics are so important for microservice style companies is that these elements can greatly affect the innovation atmosphere in an organization  Small teams reduce unhealthy groupthink and make it possible to communicate with reduced overhead and ceremony  This  in turn  makes it easier to spawn unconventional ideas and get them implemented and tested more quickly  And small ideas  executed quickly  is an important element in establishing an innovation dynamic in your company  As Ron Ashkenas and Markus Spiegel point out in their Harvard Business Review article  Your Team Shouldn t Run Like a Well Oiled Machine   small teams working independently exhibit a greater rate of innovation success than large  tightly managed teams  And our interviews with companies successfully working in the microservices way told a similar story   So  what are the keys to fostering innovation   Central mission  loose structure  Innovation happens when business goals are well understood and  the way we do things today  is not highly valued  Provide your teams with clear goals and let them know they are free to explore unusual paths to reach those goals  Defending the status quo is not likely to produce new  creative ideas   Maximize learning  Organizations with innovative cultures value learning  Several companies we interviewed put a major effort into  lunch and learn  sessions  guest lectures  and workshops   usually on company time  Also  encourage your employees to study not just within their stated field of expertise  but also in new or related fields   Failure is an option  The path to success is not a straight line  There are lots of failed attempts before discovering something new  Elon Musk tells his employees  failure is an option here   Mistakes are a learning opportunity  If you punish people when they fail  you kill innovation   More than source code and containers  Microservices is more than source code and containers  Companies that do well transitioning to a community of loosely coupled  independent teams  all spend a good deal of their time designing and managing their organizational dynamics and fostering an innovation ethos throughout the organization  Of course  evolving your company s culture doesn t happen overnight  Like any important refactoring work  it needs to be done in small  verifiable increments over time  When done well  this will result in a healthy and sustainable system that will be easier to maintain over time  And that is the microservice way   Get a free copy of Microservice Architecture to learn more about designing a microservices system that fits your business practices

287,training-dataset/business/678.txt,business,How our company culture helped us scale from 10 employees to 275Scaling a company without compromising its culture can be an incredibly challenging problem to solve  but it s certainly not impossible  One of the keys is building and maintaining a strong  genuine company culture  Through the people you hire and how you structure your teams  you can enable the company to scale effectively   Airbnb co founder and CEO Brian Chesky explains the role of culture in scaling   The stronger the culture  the less corporate process a company needs  When the culture is strong  you can trust everyone to do the right thing  People can be independent and autonomous  They can be entrepreneurial  And if we have a company that is entrepreneurial in spirit  we will be able to take our next   wo man on the moon  leap  Ever notice how families or tribes don t require much process  That is because there is such a strong trust and culture that it supersedes any process   Ever been to a tech festival  TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe  See what s in store for 2017  LEARN MORE  Company culture enables effective scaling by keeping precise rules  processes  and red tape to a minimum  Team members know what to do because the culture guides them   The two most important mechanisms behind scaling and building culture are personal traits and team based values  Here I will review the strategies that worked for us  but don t take them as a template  Every company is different   Whether you re a founder  leader or manager  it s ultimately up to you to create unique ways of identifying talent and instilling team based values  Just because a tactic works for one company or team doesn t mean it ll work for yours  Make sure to understand your team thoroughly  to experiment  and to always reinvent   A little background  I co founded a company called Flipp  and helped grow it from a 10 person team to 275 employees  We recently raised  61 million in funding  and have won several awards for our company culture along the way   Despite all that  the moment I knew we were getting it right was when I overheard one of our team members saying   We haven t hired a single person that I don t like  They re all people I would ve been friends with in real life    People make up the bedrock of all companies  their cultures  and teams  Here s how we went from 10 to 275 team members  and how we plan to go to over 500   Culture starts with people    When we recruit  we look for three character traits that we refer to as our 3H system  Humble  Hungry  and Highly intelligent  Candidates we hire have these traits in spades   Humble candidates know the difference between confidence and arrogance  They re transparent with their mistakes  and not concerned about their status or job title   candidates know the difference between confidence and arrogance  They re transparent with their mistakes  and not concerned about their status or job title  Hungry candidates have high growth expectations for themselves and the team  and they re willing to push themselves to achieve them   candidates have high growth expectations for themselves and the team  and they re willing to push themselves to achieve them  Highly intelligent candidates don t just have high IQ and raw brain processing power  They also have a high sense of empathy and awareness   known more formally as relational intelligence   Despite the raw strengths of these traits  we know we need to harness them to build a system that maximizes the team s potential  We actively work to build a team culture that brings out and reinforces these personal traits in each of our team members   Culture is sustained with team based values  Humble  hungry  and highly intelligent people contribute positively to our team s culture  but it would be impossible to maintain them without the guidance of three team based value pillars  which we uphold in everything we do  We call them our ABC s   Always reinvent   Our team is most concerned with improving  They re excited to experiment and not discouraged when things break or blow up     Our team is most concerned with improving  They re excited to experiment and not discouraged when things break or blow up  Be team first   Our team members hold themselves and each other accountable  and are open to a healthy amount of conflict to come to the best decision for the team     Our team members hold themselves and each other accountable  and are open to a healthy amount of conflict to come to the best decision for the team  Coach others  Our team members make each other better  They proactively share information  and support and train each other   The magic touch   making people and teams work together  Hunger enables us to identify ambitious team members who can adapt to an ever changing landscape  One of our company s values is to always reinvent   to create better solutions to existing problems  or find solutions to new problems   Ambition makes for great fuel  but is essentially an individual trait  That s why we balance ambition with being team first  Some ambitious people can be driven solely by personal glory  We re more interested in people who can  and want to  put the team first   Team first ambitious people are driven  but they re equally interested in making sure the team succeeds  They are accountable to each other   in spite of whatever internal conflict might arise  Being team first is about being open to feedback  and learning from it  for the sake of the team   We also find that when people are team first  they re interested in coaching others  Leaders and coaches make for great advisors  but teams unlock their full potential when all members coach each other  We like to work with people who see challenges or setbacks as opportunities to fix mistakes as a team  rather than blaming each other   Intelligence is essential to our recruiting  because smart people want to work with other smart people  And if they re really hungry  they actually prefer to work with smarter people to learn as much as possible  This is more conducive to teams that see opportunities in challenges  are willing to coach each other  and see themselves as part of a bigger unit   We use these team based values   always reinvent  be team first  and coach others   as the foundation of our culture  They re constant reference points for how we make decisions regarding culture fit   With our ABC s set  we constantly think about our team based values and how to reinforce them  We know that if we don t proactively maintain and evolve our culture  it will die  We ve seen it happen to so many other companies   starting off with great momentum only to hire aggressively  urgently  and carelessly   Lacking a concrete set of personal and team level ideals to make decisions on  their culture inadvertently breeds competitiveness  jealousy  and envy  Toxic cultures repel the candidates you most want to attract  and that s how great companies start to die   Guide your culture through servant leadership  Obviously  leaders have an important role in implementing team based values  The most effective leaders commit themselves to the growth of others and putting others  needs first  they re interested in enabling each team member to be the best versions of themselves  They remove obstacles and facilitate growth  This is known as servant leadership   Most importantly  they provide clarity and meaning to team members so the work has meaning and purpose  They have a clear idea of what excellence looks like  and they work hard to enforce this standard   This drives long term work fulfillment in each team member  which makes it easier for team members to be happy  Practically speaking  this fulfillment is crucial for retaining team members   Stick to the fundamentals  The key to scaling is hiring people with these personal traits  and building team based value pillars to make the most of those traits  I have no doubt that the specific tactics  around communication  scheduling  and management  may change as we scale  But this iteration and reinvention should be based on the same personal traits and team based values  They fundamentally remain the same  They are everlasting   No matter what stage your company is at  you can use the 3H system to help build your team and the ABC s to maximize your team s potential  But as your company grows  it s also important for you to consider your specific industry  your company s DNA  and what types of people are the best fit for your team  and the kind of culture that would enable your company to excel   Read next  9 content marketing tips for sales

403,training-dataset/business/596.txt,business,Why two heads are worse than oneYou may have heard of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos  famous  two pizza rule  if a team can t be fed by two pizzas  that team is too big   Whether you work at a growing startup or a large corporation  it s tempting to think that adding more people will be the silver bullet that solves all your problems  After all  the more people assigned to a project  the faster it will be completed  right   Don t post that new job opening just yet   Studies are piling up to show that adding more team members may actually hinder team productivity overall  In fact  there s a growing consensus among business professionals that 5 8 member teams maximize employees  potential  leading to more engagement  accountability  and of course  productivity   Not only does this rule apply to team sizes  it also serves as a helpful guideline for maximizing productivity in meetings and strengthening manager employee relationships   Why exactly are small teams so much more effective  And what concrete techniques can leaders use to capture the benefits of a smaller is better approach to teamwork  Here s what the research has to say   Why  Team  Size Matters  In considering the benefits of 5 8 person teams  the logic is that the fewer people working together  the less bureaucracy can get in the way  In simpler terms  fewer moving pieces equals more efficiency   Here s a list of the benefits of a two pizza team   Increased Engagement  In his aptly titled article for Forbes  Why Smaller Teams Are Better Than Larger Ones  Jacob Morgan writes that employees are more engaged and satisfied with their output when working you guessed it  in small teams   Small teams prevent  social loafing   where individual contributions are perceived to be less valuable  given the sheer number of people sharing the same task  Though this idea is often summarized as  individual effort decreases as the team size increases   perhaps it is more helpful to think of its converse that individual effort increases as the team size decreases   Take the results of Gallup s 2013 report on The State of the American Workplace  companies with fewer than 10 employees scored engagement levels of 42   whereas the average engagement level for bigger companies was below 30    The same goes for team sizes within larger companies  Teams with  five to nine employees have relatively higher engagement compared with teams of 10 or more employees    The benefits of increased engagement alone are astounding  The same Gallup report found that workers who care about their output garner higher customer ratings  profitability  and productivity  fewer safety incidents  and lower absenteeism   More Effective Communication  It should come as no surprise that it s easier to keep in touch with a smaller group of people than a larger one  imagine having to follow your entire graduating class on Facebook instead of just your closest friends   In small teams  not only do you have fewer people to keep track of  but you re more aware of each person s responsibilities and how your own work fits in   This is the idea of  link management   a concept introduced by Harvard Psychology professor J  Richard Hackman  He explains   as a team gets bigger  the number of links that need to be managed among members goes up at an accelerating  almost exponential rate  It s managing the links between members that gets teams into trouble  My rule of thumb is no double digits    In other words  the larger the team  the more difficult it is for members to communicate with each other and check on one another s progress  and the more muddled and chaotic the project can become  This is perhaps why Hackman ends up saying   Big teams usually wind up just wasting everybody s time    More Innovation  and more productive meetings    Just as small teams lead to better communication  they re also believed to prevent groupthink  The failure to critically evaluate ideas  as one Fast Company article summarizes   is more likely to occur with large  centralized teams   In contrast  employees in small teams are more likely to voice their own opinions  challenge those of others  and ultimately make better  more thought out decisions   When teams grow too large  or small teams must engage in cross team exchanges  employees  independence and innovation suffers  As Neil Christie writes   limiting dysfunctional decision making and being discerning about how and where communication is needed would be beneficial to all    To counteract this  try scheduling smaller meetings  again  5 8 seems to be the sweet spot   with only essential personnel  Participants in smaller meetings are less likely to  go with the flow  and more likely to voice individual ideas  feel more included in the process  and thus feel more engaged   Stronger Support Network  Psychologist and Professor of Management Jennifer Mueller coined the term  relational loss  in her study Why Individuals in Larger Teams Perform Worse  Relational loss occurs when  an employee perceives that support is less available in the team as team size increases    This perceived loss of support is not only from fellow team members  but also from team managers  who are responsible for evaluating and or coaching large groups of people  Simply put  the larger the group  the less individual attention that can be passed out   On the other hand  smaller teams  by providing more perceived support  are further able to  buffer stressful experiences and promote performance    And So Much More   Smaller teams allow for greater accountability  autonomy  and flexibility  both in terms of scheduling  and idea based changes  They  foster greater trust among team members and less fear of failure    They also tend to outperform larger teams   For instance  researchers Staats  Milkman  and Fox conducted a study in which teams of two and teams of four were tasked with building a Lego structure  The results  The two person team completed the Lego structure in 36  less time  even though the four person team was almost twice as optimistic about outperforming the smaller team  As Neil Christie observes   Larger teams breed overconfidence and underperformance    Big Time Tips for Small Team Managers  So you ve split your teams into groups of 5 8  Now you can just sit back and watch that productivity graph soar  right   Wrong   The same Gallup report that found the highest levels of engagement in teams of 10 or fewer  found that  managers continue to be the most powerful influence on workers  engagement levels    And seeing as  managers with larger teams have a bigger challenge when it comes to engaging their employees   it s in everyone s best interest to keep teams small   Johanna Rothman  of the Rothman Consulting Group  writes that even experienced managers should not be responsible for more than 9 employees  Any more than that  she says  and you threaten your ability to make meaningful relationships with your team members   What does she recommend for managers of small teams   Schedule one on one meetings  weekly or bi weekly  with every team member  This functions to build a  trusting relationship  and to offer coaching to any who need it   Schedule weekly  community of practice  meetings  Most people want to learn  and they will appreciate meetings where the primary objective is to develop skills  whether those are technical skills  project management techniques  or other areas that cater to employee interest  Managers  employees  and invited speakers all have  practices  to present   Provide people with routes to information  especially if you can t solve their problems yourself  Rothman gathered project reports from each team member and emailed that collated information to the team  If interested  employees working on different projects could share more specifics  but at least they didn t have to waste time in status meetings  Speaking of which   Make sure that  the right people are invited to the right meetings   There s no use in wasting people s time  including your own  If someone would benefit from attending a meeting  send her onward  If not  let her spend her time productively   Remember that though you may be  the boss   you are not the sole source of knowledge  and your ultimate responsibility lies in  creating an environment in which everyone can do their best work    That being said  companies come in all sorts of shapes and sizes  so why don t we move on to   My company can t function in 5 8 person teams   is there any way to benefit from these ideas   The short answer yes  In a follow up to his Forbes article  Jacob Morgan provides tactics that companies can use to remain productive and engaged  even if their teams aren t two pizza sized   Invest in collaborative technologies   ahem  I would recommend one in particular    Internal social networks keep employees connected  foster a flexible work environment  and value individual contributions  all of which make employees more engaged and give employers insight into how their teams best operate   Strive for visible objectives   At Morningstar Farms  employees create Colleague Letters of Understanding  CLOU  which is a personal mission statement for how the employee will help the organization including performance metrics  This CLOU is how employees hold each other accountable for various projects since they have complete visibility into each other s goals  objectives  and performance metrics   What s more  employees cannot  hide behind ambiguity  or engage in social loafing   Provide autonomy by tracking output rather than hours  This one is simple don t micro manage  As Morgan writes   the role of managers is simply to help employees understand where the company needs to go  but how the company gets there is up to the employees    Challenge outdated management practices   The best thing that organizations can do to continuously improve engagement and productivity is to evaluate and test common assumptions around how work is currently being done   This can take the form of abolishing annual employee reviews in favor of regular check ins  Adobe   dissolving managerial positions and making all employees leaders  Whirlpool   or even budgeting for employees to take  an interesting person  out for coffee  LinkedIn   The team at Doist receives a  50 month educational stipend  Point being  by challenging conventions  you can often find new ways to promote productivity and engagement   Sizing Up  or rather  sizing down  Small Teams  With increased engagement  innovation  and productivity  the advantages of slimming down your companies  teams should be clear  And by trying out some of the above management techniques  you can make your own and your employees  work lives much less stressful   You want employees  and managers  you can rely on  so why not maximize their potential to do just that   Ultimately  of course  it comes down to what works best for your company  How many people do you need to work on a single project  Who do they need to communicate with  How much autonomy should they have   Depending on how happy you are with the company s productivity  it may be worthwhile to make some changes  Consider starting with smaller teams  smaller meetings  or have managers responsible

420,training-dataset/business/610.txt,business,Team Health Monitors and Why Your Startup Needs a Check upIn sports  the name on the back of a jersey can garner more attention than the one on the front  It s Lebron James  not the Cavaliers  or J J  Watt  not the Texans  These stars are put on pedestals and heralded for their incredible skill and accomplishments  They share one important key to success though  argues Jay Simons  president of enterprise software company Atlassian  they belong to great teams  Simons believes that when it comes to both sports and business  it s the power of the team that makes the difference  Teams are the real reason why organizations are successful   not just the superstar power of a few standout individuals     Simons is not alone in this belief  Over 400 organizations including Nike and Virgin have invited Simons and his team to teach Atlassian s method for assessing  monitoring and improving team health  Atlassian has open sourced its team playbook  which includes team specific health assessments as well as tactics for working through common pain points  like leadership deficits or conflicting priorities  Simons and his colleagues are so passionate about the topic that the company s NASDAQ ticker symbol is TEAM  Prior to Atlassian  Simons was the VP of Marketing at software maker BEA Systems  which was acquired by Oracle   Drawing from his talk at First Round s CEO Summit  Simons outlines the eight traits of successful teams  determined after an studying hundreds of Atlassian teams across departments  He lays out the six step process that ll help teams of any kind  at any size company understand where they might need improvement  Lastly  Simons shares examples of how Atlassian teams have made adjustments to their processes after assessing their performance with the help of a health monitor   How You re Measuring Performance Isn t Enough  Early on at Atlassian  Simons and his colleagues regularly assessed individual performance  as most companies do  Those performance reviews would help identify the roughly 5  of the overall workforce that was underperforming  They studied this group and noticed that  in the vast majority of cases  they were comprised of formerly high performing people who were delivering below average results  That s when they spotted an unfortunate trend  star individuals   those rated highly in consecutive performance reviews   who were moved to struggling teams then became underperformers themselves  Simons and other managers began to ask how they could determine what was missing and broken  That s when they realized that team health is a crucial priority for any growing organization   Atlassian began to hone in on the issue after a few painful incidents borne of bad teamwork at the company  which operates on five continents and employs over 1 600 people  Simons and his team looked at teams and projects that had been successful   ones that had become company lore  were mentioned with smiles  or spawned their own T shirts   and contrasted them with bad projects   the ones that were mentioned in hushed tones or silence  Qualitative data gave Atlassian enough of a hypothesis to quickly pinpoint and test attributes  rather than get mired in a complex initial methodology  Comparing and contrasting sentiment on successful and unsuccessful teams helped propel the process out of the gate   The ultimate goal of examining these two categories of teams was to hone in what made the successful teams great and identify the deficiencies of the underperforming teams  particularly those where their rockstars  performance was faltering  Over the course of their work  Simons and his colleagues identified eight elements of successful teams   that is  the key attributes and tools characteristic of teams that consistently outperformed others   and tested it with 40 teams  This criteria was developed for functional teams such as engineering and marketing  the company has also created Health Monitors for leadership teams and service teams   The Eight Elements of Healthy Teams  Proof of concept  In fact  it s not just a proof of concept  but a reason for   and clear path toward   continued effort  It s vital that people understand not only why a project exists  but also why they must work on it in a particular way   We found successful product teams had some kind of end to end walk through that proves why the problem needed to be solved  the best path forward and why it would work   Simons says   Teams often agree on the end goal of the project  but each individual can have a different way of getting there  We had one engineering team that created a document showing three ways of solving a problem  and demonstrating why one way made the most sense    One pager  Successful teams all had a readme that explained what they were trying to do and how they measured success  It was designed and summarized so that any colleague   on or off the project   could quickly get up to speed   It described the elements and parameters of the project simply  in a way team members could digest  and it could be used to onboard others   Simons says   For example  a helpful one pager had at least the following  a charter  which spelled out the team s mission  and a bulleted list of the goals the team is delivering  so that others could quickly understand the steps to success    Velocity  Velocity is defined as forward momentum  In the context of startups  that s the push to always be shipping   Successful teams had two key components of velocity  a method for tracking and sharing progress with the company  and a schedule for delivering concrete pieces of work to stakeholders in an incremental way   Simons says   Successful teams broke down their work into manageable chunks of two week sprints  after which they shipped their work  reflected on their performance and shared results with the organization    Full time owner  Successful teams could identify a single individual or lead that was accountable for each component of a project   How often have you been part of a team where it feels like everybody needs to get in the room to make a decision  That s a failure in having a full time owner of an aspect of a project   Simons says   This trait tends to be a linchpin and is related to the health of the other seven attributes  The more individual accountability we found in a team  the better the team tended to do on the other success traits    Ask teams who s accountable for various parts of a project  Unsuccessful teams have to talk about it  Successful teams can point to the owner   Value and metrics  Team members need to understand and agree on success metrics   Successful teams know the value they re trying to deliver  metrics are how they know they re being successful  Ever come out of a meeting where everyone agreed  but then pursued slightly different directions after they convened   Simons asks   In one case  we had a team that was ready to kill a certain feature  but they were stuck  We found the PM and engineering leader disagreed on the value and metrics for that project  The eng leader wanted to save time for one type of customer while the PM wanted to increase usage across many types of users  Once we acknowledged and addressed that misalignment  the team was able to ship    Shared understanding  Simons found that top teams trusted each other and were fully on board with their collective goal   Successful teams had a shared belief in the why of what they were doing  It wasn t enough to understand what or how  They needed a conviction around why their project mattered   Simons says   We had one team whose leader was pushing fast decisions without explaining his reasoning  People were unclear on their responsibilities and instead were just running around putting out fires that had been started by him  The team made a push to get on the same page  implementing a one pager and end to end proof of concept document  Impressed  the leader pledged to a new rule that every decision he d make would come with a short  three line explanation  Within weeks  their teamwork improved dramatically    Balanced team  Successful teams also had a varied set of skills  talents  work experiences and problem solving styles that made sense for the project that they were working on   A mix of all these attributes doesn t guarantee success  just as a homogenous group won t  The former  if done haphazardly  can feel like a tax  while the latter leads to groupthink   says Simons   The key is a team with a shared understanding and full time owners that also features people from varied professional and personal backgrounds  Operating under the same rules  their differences lead to divergent and more creative thought  That s when great things happen    Managed dependencies  Star teams also managed their reliance on other individuals  teams and projects   Sometimes a holdup on a project is due to a circumstance that s out of your hands  Successful teams documented those dependencies and understood the associated risks  They built clear plans and check ins for working through them   Simons says   We observe that the best teams have a plan for managing their top two to three dependencies  They check in with each other on them   and not just when something s about to hit the fan  Low performing teams know they re in a complex environment but grind away and hope for the best  Teams must accept that externalities will impact their work and plan to mitigate them    Jay Simons at the First Round CEO Summit   The Six Steps to Evaluating Team Health  After their research  Simons and his team had narrowed down the successful traits for teams  They were determined to put them to work   At the start of a project or a formation of a new team  we wanted to be able to use this framework to help propel a group in the right direction  We created a team health monitor as a way to help them better understand some of the things that make successful teams tick  It s also a tool to diagnose weak spots   Simons says   This isn t a performance review  which largely reflects what you did in the past and forces people to put their guard up  We want shields to be down and teams to park defensiveness at the door   both of which tend to be active in a critical review    At Atlassian  team health monitor sessions led to an improvement in team morale  people reported being happier and more productive  Teams became far more likely to hit their goals  Perhaps the most convincing endorsement of the health monitors was their usage went up   they weren t requirements for teams  but they were using them of their own accord   Set the Stage  Here s how a team health monitor works  including what and who you need  Let s start with ground rules   Initiate a health monitor at will  Any teammate can trigger a team health monitor   Create   two pizza teams    As coined by Jeff Bezos  these are groups of 6 10  essentially the size of team that can be fed by two pizzas   Do health monitors regularly  This varies  but the key is to develop a cadence  At Atlassian  one team ran a five minute review every morning  while more stable teams did them every two to four weeks   Don t run it so often you get frustrated because you can t take action on the findings  but no so infrequently that you find things you could have avoided   Simons says   Each health monitor takes one hour  Here s how the meeting breaks down   20 minutes for setup and ground rules  20 minutes for talking through the assessment  20 minutes for reflecting the results and agreeing on remedie  Each health monitor requires the following tools and participants   Post it notes  red  yellow and green   Whiteboard  A grid listing the eight tools and traits of star teams  6 10 participants  A team facilitator  who leads the session   A team health monitor in action  Atlassian  The facilitator is key function for any health monitor  At Atlassian  Dominic Price  the company s head of R D  was their chief facilitator   When we promoted the notion of the team health check really early on  we dressed Dom in a doctor s suit and put little funny flyers everywhere just to get people curious about what it was  and to just to make it lighthearted and interesting   Simons says   Dom sets the tone for the session  We re not trying to identify individuals or challenges with individuals  It s meant to be this constructive  open dialogue just about how things are working  There s no judgment here  It s mostly around just trying to have teams look in the mirror and figure out where they are  where they stand    The facilitator sets the tone for the session and gives basic rules of engagement   There are no right or wrong answers   Everyone s opinion is equal   Listen  Listen hard   Don t settle  or say things are OK just to move on   It s not about the leader or an individual  instead it s a constructive and open dialogue about better collaboration   Don t dive into problem solving until the end   Assess the Vital Signs  Once you ve set up the room and laid down the ground rules  split the team of 6 10 people into groups of two or three   The reason we break up the original group into smaller teams is to balance a diversity of viewpoints in an environment where each one can voiced  Then the groups reconvene to try to reach agreement around where things stand   Simons says   These small groups should decide how well the team rates on each of the eight attributes of successful teams by placing a red  yellow or green post it note by each trait  Red stands for bad  yellow stands for so so and green stands for good  With each rating  groups write one   and only one   bullet point or observation that led them to pick that color  Resist the temptation to solve problems at this stage   instead  just focus on observations for now and getting raw ratings as small teams on the board    It could be like saying there are holdups due to another team with which you share a managed dependency  or it could be that you feel your team is terrible at aligned values because everyone seems to always value different things   perhaps one group of people values speed  and the other group values quality  This naturally creates friction   Simons says   But the point is to boil down every rating to one key takeaway  so that you can pinpoint exactly why you feel the way you do in one sentence  Explain that everyone s view is acceptable  and have people give their ratings before they speak  It gives everyone equal footing and gets the introverts involved  and increases the chances of candid conversation    The framework for a team health monitor  Atlasssian  Discuss the Ratings  Your facilitator   Dom  in Atlassian s case   then helps the whole group find consensus around their ratings  The smaller teams come back together to talk as a whole  Each group talks through why they rated an attribute the color they did  Dom asks questions to find commonality  His goal as a facilitator is to arrive at a single rating for each attribute across the entire team of 6 10 people   The rule here is where there s discrepancies or differences of opinion  we always downgrade  We try to look for consensus or unanimous voice versus just one strong voice  Where there s dissension  we always downgrade to yellow or red and say that there s some things that we can work on to get everybody on the same page    At this point  you might have a lot of red and yellow post its on the board  Don t panic   Remember  there s no judgment here  This is the first of what will be a regular set of checkpoints our team will do together  You may do them quarterly or every other month or even monthly  It s simply a yardstick you can use to improve   Simons says   The key in this part of the process is to keep asking  why  and  how  questions   why does this team feel the way it does  How did things get this way  Keep diving deeper and more specific  Eventually you ll find the root of the issue  and be able to strip it down to a clear problem    Agree on Focus Areas  Now it s time to spend around 20 minutes picking two or three things marked red or yellow to work on  Your facilitator should suggest different ways the team can move the ratings in a positive direction  Guide the conversation towards items that are actionable  specific and measurable  and create clear due dates and assignments for those items    Now we have a base line  We ve picked two things that we re going to work on over a period of time  That s actually good enough  We can move forward from there   Simons says   Once you ve agreed on those focus areas  you can move to the next step  finding remedies    Find Remedies  The health check serves to highlight areas that teams can work on and how they should plan to approach it  Now it s time to drill down and get more specific about the remedies for tackling these issues   In many cases  we had frameworks already in place to help teams go green  a framework for decision making  a template for a one page readme or project guides and checklists for a proof of concept or metrics   Simons says   They weren t being used because people didn t identify the need  That s what the health check did   it highlighted a deficiency or pain point and pointed groups toward solutions that often were already in place to help  It was incredibly powerful    In one scenario  a team was unhappy with their velocity  They didn t have a clearly defined mission and weren t delivering on their deadlines   Their remedy  which is really common in these situations  is to complain about resourcing or about the number of people on the team  They said they needed more help  They could improve velocity if they added more people to the team  When we ran our health monitor  it demonstrated a lack of passion amongst the team  Adding more people into that environment actually compounded the problem   Simons says   The more people the team added  the slower they seemed to become  After this realization  they stopped just adding people to the team and instead focused on improving the fundamentals of how the existing group of people would operate together    In another case  Simons oversaw a marketing team that executed the health monitor  It soon became clear that there was a complete lack of shared understanding   A go through the motions offsite turned into a very real  productive  and specific discussion around trust between team members  They carved out time for individuals to have one on ones with each other  like biweekly coffees  to build more trust and understanding   Simons says   Now the health monitor is a recurring part of this team s weekly meeting  something they make room for and consistently reinforce  And it all started with that red post it    Schedule a Check Up  Once you ve reached a consensus on the problem areas and what needs to be  return to the health monitor after a month or a quarter   You need to be able to track the progress that you re making on turning those reds and yellows into greens  If you re not moving the needle on the two focus areas you picked out  it s time to sit down again and talk about what s going wrong  You might even engage the facilitator again for another session with the same set of ground rules to encourage openness and problem solving   Simons says   The whole point of a team health monitor is to create improvement  The only way to know if you re doing that is to check in regularly on how things are going    An example of team health monitor scores over time  Atlassian   I ll share a success story  We had a smart but relatively inexperienced interim engineering leader who saw a lack of urgency on his team  No one stepped up to make a call  so people revisited decisions over and over again without any forward movement  He ran a team health monitor  which showed they were red on shared understanding  He immediately instituted an Atlassian exercise that forces team members to delegate who s accountable for certain decisions   Simons says   Almost immediately  the team finally understood who played what role  who was making the decisions and at what time  Uncertainty decreased and trust increased  We saw him start to go from being an inexperienced leader to a critical agent in his team s transformation  He was promoted faster than average and  more importantly  his team s momentum increased noticeably    Like a physical  team health monitors are meant to be preventative  We re issuing vitamins here  not painkillers   Putting Health Monitors In Action  When it comes to monitoring the health of your organization  teams should take priority  not individual performance reviews  which can be overemphasized and over leveraged  Keep in mind the eight traits of successful teams  individual accountability  diversity  shared beliefs  aligned values and metrics  proof of concept  a readme document  managed dependencies and velocity  Create a team health monitor session and have groups rate their team on each trait  From there  choose up to three issues to work on  Address problems that come up by looking to existing frameworks or using data to understand why previous approaches have failed    Superstars win games  but teams win championships  This is also true in business  A lot of times we chalk failures up to bad management or bad luck when really the real issue is bad teamwork  Teamwork is really  really hard  It s messy  It s important not to blame any one individual for those failures  Instead  dig into the meat of the problem by regularly incorporating these team physicals and associated check ins   Simons says   We ve found that by doing this  you wind up saving a lot of time and headaches in the long run  Right now  a lot of managerial focus is on the individual and individual performance  By shifting that energy to improving and strengthening teams  you ll see an exponential improvement,"[420 403 1227 287 784 228 630 1406 976 196 1264]"

592,training-dataset/business/192.txt,business,The Path to Making People a Priority   ThinkGrowth orgThe Path to Making People a Priority  Once upon a time  like many startups  HubSpot turned its nose up at human resources  We thought  compared to business priorities like product market fit  it just wasn t that important  We viewed HR as the very bureaucracy we were trying so hard to resist   In time  we changed our minds   Over the years  HubSpot has steadily increased its investment in culture  And as I ve watched other companies do the same  I ve started to observe some common milestones on the path to making people a priority   Milestone  1  Recognize that culture matters  The first version of a company s culture emerges organically  It will be some blend of your company s mission  the personality and working style of of your founder s   and the first 5 10 hires  Often  in the early days of a new  growing company  the excitement about the mission you re on and the product you re building will be enough to power a good culture  But that culture has a shelf life   In 2012  our CEO  Brian Halligan  attended a CEO support group  and the topic of culture came up  A fellow CEO told him HubSpot should get more thoughtful about culture  so he asked the most thoughtful person he knew to tackle it  his co founder  Dharmesh   Milestone  2  Codify what makes you tick  Dharmesh took the challenge head on and became the architect of what would eventually become HubSpot s Culture Code  The document Dharmesh created has garnered more than three million views to date   Warning here  the better your culture is  the harder it will be to codify  In a crappy company culture  employees will likely ignore your attempts to clarify your values and mission or nod along in bored agreement  In a great company culture  the opposite is likely to happen  it did for us    For us  employees were vocal about feeling like the entire effort was  corporatey   In addition  our employees were  and are  fiercely protective of the culture they had helped build at HubSpot  The thought of releasing the  secret sauce  of that culture to the public elicited some strong responses   In spite of this negative feedback  Dharmesh decided to move head with publishing the culture code in 2012  We felt it was important for two reasons   We re a transparent business  and being transparent means sharing our approach with our candidates  customers  and prospects  The very act of writing it down would hold us accountable to living up to it  so the document itself would not initiate impending doom  but rather set the tone from the top that culture is a business priority and hold us accountable for delivering on that promise   While we didn t wait for consensus to ship the culture code  we did get input  Dharmesh solicited three rounds of company wide input and asked for specific guidance on a few key concepts from people whose opinion he really valued  then shipped it  He called it  code  for a reason like the code we ship to customers  he wanted us to regularly refactor the document to match the needs of our customers and our company   To this day  Dharmesh personally refactors the Culture Code  often designing the slides himself  on a quarterly basis with input from our employees   Milestone  3  Market what matters  Here is where you ll start to feel the first return on your culture investment  Once you re clear about what makes your culture special  and once you share that with the world  you ll start to attract more and more people who are excited about what you re doing   When we launched the Culture Code  we knew it would resonate with employees and prospective employees  We drastically underestimated was how much the Culture Code would resonate with our customers   Your prospects have thousands of options for companies to do business with it s your job to give them a compelling reason why they should choose yours  Particularly in the world of software as a service  your customers are buying a long term relationship with your team  they want to understand what type of business you re building   Milestone  4  Scale culture  In 2014  HubSpot went public  a milestone for the company  but often a negative milestone for organizational cultures  We had heard time and time again that the year after your IPO is when you should anticipate the highest attrition and expect your culture to go sideways   Dharmesh  Brian  and our COO  JD Sherman  wanted to defy these odds and they asked me to lead the charge on this front as the VP of culture  Up to this point  I had worked closely with Dharmesh on the launch of the Culture Code  and spent long hours debating what autonomy means  how we structure unlimited vacation at scale  and how we describe our culture to potential investors on the IPO Roadshow  I figured there was a high chance that I would be unemployed in six months  but I took the role one month after our IPO   That was two years ago   We made plenty of mistakes during the scale up stage  but I think there are three things we got right  And for anyone in scale mode   whether that s expanding post IPO or going from 10 50 employees   these will likely pay off for you as well   We doubled down on what was working  Transparency was always a core part of our culture  so we decided to double down on it  In addition to providing company wide access to management team decks and materials  every executive began taking turns writing a summary of our meeting and his or her impressions of it  then circulating these notes to the entire company  As you scale  double down on the parts of your culture your employees care about most   Transparency was always a core part of our culture  so we decided to double down on it  In addition to providing company wide access to management team decks and materials  every executive began taking turns writing a summary of our meeting and his or her impressions of it  then circulating these notes to the entire company  As you scale  double down on the parts of your culture your employees care about most  We started to close the gap between what we say and what we do  We always said we were an environment that welcomed everyone  but for years  our social events centered around after hours happy hours an activity that excludes parents  non drinkers  or just health conscious people who would rather hit the gym than a bar after work  This caused a lot of frustration for employees who saw the gap between what we said mattered and what we did  We ve started to close this gap  Today  we offer more networking events during the workday and also offer wellness coaching and fitness classes on premise   We always said we were an environment that welcomed everyone  but for years  our social events centered around after hours happy hours an activity that excludes parents  non drinkers  or just health conscious people who would rather hit the gym than a bar after work  This caused a lot of frustration for employees who saw the gap between what we said mattered and what we did  We ve started to close this gap  Today  we offer more networking events during the workday and also offer wellness coaching and fitness classes on premise  Innovating to avoid disruption  People talk a lot about products getting disrupted and not enough about how culture is the root cause of innovation  or lack of it   Some ways we solved for this as we scaled was by building programs to help front line employees pitch ideas for new products to our senior leadership meetings  launching a Failure Forum to highlight and incentivize trying new things  and bringing in speakers to help us learn from the mistakes others have made as it relates to complacency  The bigger you are  the harder innovation becomes  you need to build your culture for this   Milestone  5  Measure culture  If you re a data driven company  eventually you re going to want to start measuring your culture efforts   On the employee experience side  we conduct a quarterly survey using employee Net Promoter Score to ask employees how likely they are to recommend HubSpot to a friend  We use a consumer marketing technique very intentionally here  if you re not happy enough at work that you would actively recommend joining our team to a friend  then you re not that happy   Don t wait for people to leave your organization en masse before you find out what s broken in your organization   create a regular  public  and painless opportunity for employees to tell you what s going on in their world  and be radically transparent with the results even when they are terrible  It s hard to read what isn t working at your company  but it s a lot harder to fix when things are horribly broken than when you can proactively address issues before they become toxic   On the candidate experience  we monitor every stage of the candidate journey   from candidate NPS scores to acceptance rates  Our approach to data within our people operations team is to use full funnel employee data points as leading indicators rather than wait for lagging ones to emerge   One other note  companies love to use internal data as a form of self congratulations  ignoring platforms like Glassdoor or InHerSight because they include data points that are hard to hear about your organization  You can ignore external data and employee review sites for as long as you d like  but you do so at your peril   the scores your candidates and employees leave on review sites are seen by thousands of people each year and have a far greater impact on your acceptance rates and brand than you realize   Milestone  6  Test culture  Unlike software code  a company s culture code can t be tested in a testing environment  These tests will appear at random  and likely when you least expect them  But being passing these tests is an important milestone  This is when it becomes clear to everyone whether or not your culture is some random ideals you tacked on a wall  or a true reflection of your company   This past year  HubSpot went through one our biggest tests yet  It s no secret that a former employee wrote a book about his negative experience at HubSpot  and the ensuing fallout led to a series of articles with accusations about our culture  our team  and our business   During that time  it would have been easy to just send out a brief comment to employees asking them not to talk about it internally or externally  and even better just to ignore it altogether  We decided to do the opposite  We used this opportunity to build trust by over communicating with employees  taking tough questions in executive Q As  and even publishing an honest LinkedIn response to the book   Your employees are smart and intuitive  and they talk to each other  their significant others  their families  and candidates  Don t let the most interesting conversations happen in whispers  Create meaningful dialogue about what matters and what s broken even when  especially when  it s hard to do so   Milestone  7  Give people an  actual  seat at the table  For all the talk about culture  it s still rare to find someone at the c level who is representing the voice of employees  In 2015  HubSpot created its first  Chief People Officer  role  filled by Jim O Neill   And as of yesterday  I m stepping into that role     Investment in people at the highest level of the company has allowed us to achieve some important things like having a global culture team with a presence in each of our six offices  and building out programs dedicated to make diversity and inclusion a priority  Most importantly  it keeps our entire leadership focused on making HR a business priority   Today we have a recipe for what works here  but that recipe is changing  Over the next 1 2 years  we expect HubSpot to continue to grow globally  Each of these employees will bring not just  fit   but also new additions to our culture  What will that mean for HubSpot in 1 2 5 years from now  Who knows  But I m excited about finding the next milestone on our path,"[592 625 976 287 1270 587 179 70 228 196 1088]"
625,training-dataset/business/1410.txt,business,Most Company Culture Posts are Fluffy Bullshit   Here is what you actually need to knowCompany Culture is an annoying subject to research  It s a mushy marshland of vague language  incomplete redefinitions  with lots of navel gazing and self congratulating  Writing about Culture is the acceptable way to brag about your company on your own blog  and not so subtly recruit the reader   I happened to learn the word  Bloviating  this week  and that seems like the perfect way to describe 99  of the writing on this topic   Happily  that s exactly why we re here   to get right into that 1  of meaningful resources on a topic that is crucial to building a successful business   Here s what we have this week   Where Company Culture Comes From  How to Measure  Codify  and Classify Culture  Implications of Culture  Examples and Studies of Strong Cultures  My very favorite piece this week is near the end   you won t want to miss it  Under the heading  Dominant Culture in a Surprising Industry  if you want to skip to it   Where Company Culture Comes From  It turns out to be a complicated question  While there are identifiable factors that affect Company Culture  the true source is as complex and varied as the organization itself  As Simon Sinek says in Start With Why   Your company doesn t have a culture  It is a culture   This may seem an unnecessary distinction  but many truths are hidden in this simple sentence  Culture is ever changing  evolving minute by minute   The culture is the outcome of decisions made by the organization  and it is the input for the next decisions made by the organization   Sinek s quote reminds me that cultures cannot be transferred  installed  or added   they can only evolve from the culture you already have  The starting conditions have already been set in motion in you as the founder even if the company hasn t been founded yet   80  of Culture is your Founder  It s a foundational rule of culture that companies will grow up to emulate the personalities of the founders  This is the lesson of this great post by Molly Graham  former Culture Manager of Facebook   Companies tend to reflect everything about them   their personality  strengths  weaknesses  So when you start defining culture in an intentional way  first look at yourselves      If a founder is competitive  the company will be more aggressive and competitive  If they are analytical and data driven  the company will tend to make metrics based decisions   Founders tend to hire  promote  and retain employees who are similar to them in their disciplines and approach  This scales their outlook on life and work  casting a giant shadow in their own shape   When Facebook first started to grow  Mark Zuckerberg spent time asking other CEOs about some of the things they did early on at Microsoft  Apple  and others to establish culture and explain to people what it meant to work there  One of the best pieces of advice he got was to write down a succinct list of what it meant to be  one of us    The practical implications here are that if you re going to go work at a company  look at the founder   if you don t want to be more like them  it s probably not a great match for you   And for those starting companies  work on the self awareness of your strengths and weaknesses  because that s what your company will be built upon   Thanks to Brandon Redlinger for contributing this great post   Creating Culture  Lessons from Bonobos   This great post from Bonobos Founder  Andy Dunn  is full of uncommon cultural wisdom  His perspective on the importance of firing is the best kind of writing   clear  concise  surprising  and correct   The most important people to the culture are those who leave  This is hard to say because it sounds mean  the people you fire are more important to your culture than the people you hire   It s a half truth  as you have to hire people who are an outstanding  but it s an important half truth because the best way to protect the environment is to recognize where you have erred and course correct  You reveal that culture as a by product of who stays and who goes  and to effectively  experiment  your way into what your culture is by learning who fits and who doesn t   and by learning what precisely it is they are fitting into   To do this requires courage and confrontation  You muster both of these by telling yourself it s what you must do to make the company  safe  for your best people  who should   by the way   be the only people   The other important piece in this post is his attention on the context   it s a broad category  where millions of tiny choices add up to create the culture   Now we ve got fish  but no water  The other part of culture is the context in which people operate  which is influenced by myriad things  goals  feedback  promotions  compensation  physical space  how people organize outside of work  social norms  how people talk  whether debate is promoted or squelched  how conflict happens  how hard people work  what s celebrated and what s left unsaid   That s a beautiful list of cultural factors   probably not comprehensive  but it includes some subtle and important intangibles like celebrations and how people talk  The list of things that make up and are defined by culture is longer than you would first think  Great insight from Dunn  and many thanks to my friend Derek Baynton of Offsite for introducing me to this post   Don t Fuck Up Culture  Don t Fuck Up Not Fucking Up Culture  That headline doesn t make much sense  but you ll see what I mean  In 2013  Airbnb co founder Brian Chesky wrote a letter to his company called  Don t Fuck Up The Culture    it s now a classic in Startup Culture reading   It s title is the exact advice of Airbnb Investor Peter Thiel  and the letter explains why maintaining the culture is so important   Why is culture so important to a business  Here is a simple way to frame it  The stronger the culture  the less corporate process a company needs  When the culture is strong  you can trust everyone to do the right thing   People can be independent and autonomous  They can be entrepreneurial  And if we have a company that is entrepreneurial in spirit  we will be able to take our next   wo man on the moon  leap   Ever notice how families or tribes don t require much process  That is because there is such a strong trust and culture that it supersedes any process  In organizations  or even in a society  where culture is weak  you need an abundance of heavy  precise rules and processes   In  A Critique of Don t Fuck Up The Culture  Scott Berkun works on refining some of Brian Chesky s definitions  and finding context for how those points work over longer time scales   First  Berkun echoes the lesson above  about the founder s outsized impact on the culture  how employees are really  along for the ride    Every CEO is in fact a Chief Cultural Officer  The terrifying thing is it s the CEO s actual behavior  not their speeches or the list of values they have put up on posters  that defines what the culture is  Without these four powers  Hiring  Firing  Promoting  Punishing  any employee at the company is along for the ride in a culture driven by someone more powerful than they are   And some of the challenges of living up to those cultural values  when they re challenged by employees   The most vocal challengers to most cultures are the first to be shown the door  It s in human nature to want to eliminate the most disruptive people  And it s also human nature to want to bring in more people that fit in well  Repeat these two behaviors over time and culture becomes homogeny  even if everyone still believes the culture values diversity   Cultural momentum is very difficult to shift  and moves only in small increments   especially when driven forward heavily by a strong willed founder or CEO   Thanks to Aaron Johnson for contributing these posts and their ideas   How to Measure  Codify  and Classify Culture  With the recursive nature of Company Culture   where each decision affects the culture  which then influences the next decision  it s important to realize that perception becomes reality  In other words   Your culture is not what you think it is   it is what the team thinks it is   If you fire someone for a perfectly valid reason that upholds your cultural values  but the story that the team hears is something different  it will put a dent in their perspective of the culture  and therefore the culture itself    Measuring  your culture will help you understand the possible gap between your perception and employees  perception  This is difficult with such an amorphous concept as culture  where everyone seems to have their own definition  But how do you measure it  We found some great thoughts on this   How to gather data on your culture s reach  Justin Moore  CEO of Axcient  believes culture is a necessary component of any successful company  In the old paradigm of  What gets measured gets managed   he has undertaken to measure and manage his culture precisely   You can ask dozens of different employees what the company s culture is and find that each person will respond with something unique  A good way to figure out how engrained your values are is to take impromptu verbal surveys   if more than 80  of the employees can repeat the company s stated values almost verbatim  something is working   While recitation isn t necessarily compliance  let alone fully embracing and practicing those values   it is a good test of the internal communication  and that s an important first step to full permeation of those cultural values   Moore uses biannual surveys and benchmarking to figure out how people feel about the organization  As a leader  this not only gives you a sense of how you re doing  but it also allows employees to feel responsible and to be a part of improving the culture and the company   Measuring trends in this data will give a sense of whether the culture is moving in a  positive  direction  or breaking under the strain of growth  The sooner leaders learn about cultural degradation  the better   Thanks again to Brandon Redlinger for this one   How to Classify a Culture  Another couple of great culture insights from San Francisco s master of startup culture building  Brian Chesky  This time  from his talk at Stanford   Chesky makes the point that there s no such thing as Good or Bad culture  only Strong or Weak culture   I find this mostly true   the good or bad axis exists  but it is subjective  A good culture for one person could be bad for someone else  We should all seek the self awareness and courage that allows us to find the culture in which we thrive   In the Strong vs  Weak axis  Chesky does not give us a definition  but my perspective is that cultures are Strong to the degree that they are honest  clear  and reinforced   Honest cultures are born of self assessment and embrace the virtues and faults of leaders and their organizations  This honesty is the prerequisite of clarity   Clear cultures are defined  They make hard decisions to precisely describe who what is and isn t a culture fit in a way that deliberately excludes huge chunks of the population and their beliefs  in the same way strategies must be well defined    Reinforced cultures are practiced  They have well worn pathways  and decisions can be made reflexively because of the clarity of the culture and obvious prioritization of values   Thanks to Terry Lee  Marco Scolaro  and Benjamin Kinnard for recommending Chesky s excellent talk   Reinventing Organizations  and How to Classify Them   The most commonly recommended book on the topic of Company Culture was Reinventing Organizations  which has come up a few times in conversation over the past few weeks  I haven t read it personally  though I trust Itamar to know a good book when he sees one  and he called it the best book of 2014   Click the pic to buy the book   On Itamar s blog  he pulls out a few of the most interesting pieces  Here s the breakdown of organizational classification that is the heart of the book   He studied an impressive set of organizations who have already made or are in the process of making the paradigm shift  and distilled the commonalities into three major innovations  self management  striving for wholeness  and evolutionary purpose    But not stopping there is what turns this book from an average to a very good one  For each of these innovations  Laloux provides detailed descriptions of how the core organizational structures  processes and practices change as a result  From decision making  through hiring  firing and promoting  all the way to the squishy topic of organizational culture   Another interesting insight into analyzing and classifying cultures from Reinventing Organizations is this matrix  based on different perspectives to observe the same organization in different ways   Laloux argues that in order to fully comprehend an organization  we must look at four things  people s beliefs and mindsets  people s behaviors  the organizational culture  and the organizational structures  processes and practices   Seeking out new perspectives is always a helpful exercise  and this simple framework allows us to see some of the components of Culture in new ways   Thanks to Itamar for doing the legwork and contributing great ideas   Implications of Culture  What is the impact of culture  Why does it matter  Is this just some fluffy feel good bullshit  or does it actually change the outcome   James Beshara  founder of Tilt  has a fantastic talk at Stanford s Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series  In this talk  he uses the metaphor of bricks vs  mortar to explain the non obvious importance of concepts as he s learned them  As he says   it s the stuff between the bricks that makes all the difference    So which of these is culture   Strategy would be the bricks   culture is the mortar   A solid brick wall instead of a stack of bricks means your house will stay standing in a hurricane  The difference between a good strategy  and a strategy held together with strong culture can mean success over failure   The Relationship Between Culture and Brand  Zappos   I respect a lot of the cultural innovations from Tony Hsieh at Zappos  They re one of the most popular advocates for building culture as a means of creating excellent service  What that means is summed up in this beautiful sentence   Culture is the Leading Indicator of Brand  If leaders of the company build a strong culture that shows employees love and care  employees will treat customers with that same love and care   and customers will know that the company loves and cares   Tony Hsieh is full of these pieces of wisdom  after years of building Zappos as a beacon of a strong culture  His story and his lessons are in his book  Delivering Happiness   Click the pic to buy the book   If you want the cliffnotes version  here is a blog post from Kissmetrics with some of the best quotes from the book  Just beware the obnoxious pop ups   Thanks to Eugene Tsyrklevich for sharing this post and these ideas   On High Performance Cultures  The mere mention of  culture  seems to evoke softness   butterflies and teatime and endless sharing sessions  That s not how Cliff Oxford thinks about Culture   He makes the distinction between  Human Resources Happy   meaning content in life  relaxed  balanced  at ease   and  High Performance Happy  in his NYT article  Here s what he means by  High Performance Happy    Think of an Olympic athlete jumping into the pool for those 4 30 a m  laps   High Performance Happy is an attitude with a skill set that says we are on a mission that is bigger than any one of us  We find our happiness in being on a world class team that is making a difference   High Performance Happy means you give employees tremendous responsibility  and they are happy to show that they are the best  You don t have to con them into doing things with a flavor of the month methodology that suggests they will only perform if you make them happy first  H R  Happy says  I want you to think that I like you  High Performance Happy says  I believe in you   In the rest of his article in the NY Times  he goes on to describe how to build and maintain a high performance culture  Worth a read for those working on building teams in high growth  high pressure environments   A Dominant Culture in a Surprising Industry  How much of a difference can culture make  The best answer to this question I found was the example of Nucor Steel  They manufacture steel and steel products  and have since 1940   In an incredibly competitive  unsexy  backbone of america  factory floor  commoditized industry they ve managed to become the largest steel company in America  completely destroying their competitors year after year  How  A strong culture   This exploration published on Bloomberg of the company  and its employees fanatic dedication to producing good work is the most unexpectedly fascinating and instructive piece about Company Culture I ve ever read   Here are some highlights   At Nucor  the art of motivation is about an unblinking focus on the people on the front line of the business  It s about talking to them  listening to them  taking a risk on their ideas  and accepting the occasional failure  It s a culture built in part with symbolic gestures  Every year  for example  every single employee s name goes on the cover of the annual report   Also  Nucor has a radical compensation policy  which is very closely tied to the customer s outcome in it s dealings with the company   A bonus tied to the production of defect free steel by an employee s entire shift can triple the average steelworker s take home pay       If workers make a bad batch of steel and catch it before it has moved on  they lose the bonus they otherwise would have made on that shipment  But if it gets to the customer  they lose three times that   These are exactly the kind of tough decisions that make a Strong Culture  Priorities are clear  They are well defined and thoroughly reinforced  Employees are accountable for the success of the company  Not everyone will be happy working here  and that s by design   This Steel manufacturer has lot to teach companies in every industry about building and reinforcing a strong culture   In this is an interesting thought  It is easy to build strong cultures at sexy and fast growing consumer startups and widely known brands  It is much harder to craft a strong culture at an unknown utility buried deep in the supply chain   but the benefits to the company are far greater   Airbnb has undoubtedly built a strong culture  And they had every advantage on the way there  Nucor crafted an equally strong culture from a far more difficult starting place  Both of them have things to teach us   In any company in any industry  strong cultures can be crafted  and we can learn from every attempt  whether or not it succeeds   Examples and Studies of Strong Cultures  As

630,training-dataset/business/328.txt,business,3 ways to get your team to think outside of the boxUber  Airbnb  Electric vehicles  Self driving cars  Buses that can drive over traffic  Pretty much everything Steve Jobs created at Apple since the iPod  These are the inventions of our time that aren t just about innovation  but about leaps of imagination   These are the kinds of things that make us ask  How did they get there  And  more importantly  how can I get my team there   The end results may seem neat and tidy after the fact  but you can be sure they didn t seem that way at the start   Collaboration is messy  Creativity happens in fits and with many false starts  There s no linear path from problem to solution  and there s no magic formula to innovation   But there are ways that leaders can intentionally create an environment that fosters curiosity and a willingness to engage with new ideas to see where they might lead   Here are three key strategies to foster more creative collaboration on your team   Create constraints  In 1974  Toshio Okuno was promoted to plant manager at Higashimaru Shoyu Co   Ltd   a manufacturing plant that produced over 200 products including several varieties of soy sauce  At the time  the company was struggling  A crowded market  rising costs  and stagnate prices had led to declines in profit year after year   Okuno accepted his new post on one condition  that he be allowed the freedom to revitalize the corporation  One of the innovative methods he used was called  the hangen game    Hangen meaning to reduce by half was a game that consisted of removing half a team s members and challenging those left to try to complete the work of the whole team  Okuno says removing half the group  rather than just one or two people   forces the group to reconsider every task it performs and ask whether each task was necessary    Instead of finding small ways to marginally increase efficiency  the remaining team members identified fundamental ways to re evaluate their workflows   I experienced the power of this approach personally as I listened to the workers review their jobs and come up with unique solutions that reduced their workload   Okuno says   I called it a game because I wanted them to enjoy the creative process  We proved that people really do become more creative when they are placed in a tight corner  Just as importantly  we proved that it can be fun to be creative   In the end  the team came up with a new system that kept the same line running smoothly with just 16 of the original 25 team members  Okuno was then able to reassign the extra 9 team members to other areas of the company   Ultimately  the pressure from removing half the team made it possible for employees to think more creatively about their jobs   Why was the Hangen game so effective in fostering creative teamwork  A 2011 review of six separate studies published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology may shed light on the answer   In one study  participants were asked to navigate a maze before solving a series of anagrams  Half the participants encountered an obstacle while navigating the maze  while the other half were allowed to complete the maze unhindered  The group that overcame the obstacle came up with significantly more creative answers to the anagram puzzles  even though the task was unrelated to navigating the maze   The researchers hypothesized that encountering the obstacle caused people to take a mental step back  evaluate the  big picture   and consider a wider range of options than those who completed the maze with no obstacles  similar to the group dynamics Okuno observed in the Hangen game  This open mindset then allowed them to think more creatively on the subsequent task   In other words  obstacles have the power to put us in a more creative  problem solving frame of mind  Artists often come up with creative work using very limited resources  and one study found that managers can foster more creative solutions in their teams by creating the perception of limited resources   Sohrab Vossough  founder of design and innovation consultancy Ziba  says  scarcity forces focus    Given enough time and money  any competent organization can emulate something that succeeded in the past  But when limited resources take the tried and true off the table  the only option is to come up with something new   Vossough says we can see the principle of scarcity at work in creative teams   All this may serve to explain a common characteristic of continually innovative organizations   he says   that they operate with a scarcity mindset  even in times of plenty    As a team leader  it can be tempting to throw more resources at a problem extending deadlines  adding more team members  allocating a larger budget or scale back requirements  However  if creative solutions are the goal  you may be better off doing the exact opposite   Set an ambitious deadline for a project  Define the problem as a challenge that tests current assumptions about what s possible  Limit resources by setting firm numbers for project budget  the number of team members involved  or the amount or kinds of materials used   Find ways to present challenges to your team to broaden their mindsets and consider a broader range of possible solutions to your business s problems  Teams often succeed because of the tension of working within challenging boundaries  not in spite of it   Encourage debate  In 1948  Alex Osborn was a partner in the advertising agency B B D O   widely regarded as the most innovative firm on Madison Avenue   That year  Osborn published a book called Your Creative Power  which shared his best advice on creativity   His rules about brainstorming  in particular  caught on  Osborn insisted on the  no bad idea  approach   Forget quality  aim now to get a quantity of answers  When you re through  your sheet of paper may be so full of ridiculous nonsense that you ll be disgusted  Never mind  You re loosening up your unfettered imagination making your mind deliver   However  in 1958 a group of researchers at Yale University decided to test Osborn s assertion in a controlled experiment  They recruited a group of students and had them work on different types of creative puzzles  Half the students were put into groups and instructed to follow Osborn s guidelines  while the other half worked alone with no guidelines   Counter to Osborn s brainstorming method  the study s solo students won out on measures of both quantity and quality  They were able to come up with more solutions to their creative puzzles than the students who were placed in groups  Furthermore  their solutions were judged as being more feasible and effective   Studies since then have shown similar results  according to psychologist Keith Sawyer   Decades of research have consistently shown that brainstorming groups think of far fewer ideas than the same number of people who work alone and later pool their ideas   In 2003  psychology researcher Charlan Nemeth discovered that the secret to creative brainstorming might actually be the exact oppositive of Osborn s advice  She gave groups of five students a single problem to solve   How can traffic congestion be reduced in the San Francisco Bay Area   The groups then had 20 minutes to come up with as many solutions as they could  Each group was assigned one of three conditions   Brainstorming guidelines  including the  no criticism  rule  Debating guidelines  including suggestions to debate and even criticize each other s ideas  Control group with no extra guidelines  The brainstorming groups did outperform the control groups  though only slightly   However  the group that actively debated ideas came in first   The debate groups came up with almost twenty per cent more ideas  on average  Even more surprisingly  the effect continued even after the initial brainstorm  After the teams broke up  each individual was asked if they had any more ideas to share  The brainstormers and control group members offered three more ideas on average  while the debaters produced seven   Nemeth said of the study   While the instruction  Do not criticize  is often cited as the important instruction in brainstorming  this appears to be a counterproductive strategy  Our findings show that debate and criticism do not inhibit ideas but  rather  stimulate them relative to every other condition   Nemeth suggests dissent helps us come up with new ideas because it encourages us to reassess our viewpoints by engaging more with the work of others  Although it s less positive to throw out the  no bad ideas  spiel  Nemeth says the compromise is worth it   Maybe debate is going to be less pleasant  but it will always be more productive  True creativity requires some trade offs   So throw out the old rules that prohibited criticism and encourage your team to set aside egos  ask questions  and engage with each other s ideas in a constructive way  Reframe debate as a positive  vital part of any problem solving or creative process   Foster positivity  The strategies outlined above can easily backfire without a positive team culture to support them teams can quickly become overwhelmed by the pressures of meeting seemingly impossible expectations  and debates can easily devolve into petty disagreements  resentment  and gridlock   These strategies are most effective when supported by an underlying culture of trust and positivity that allows people to be vulnerable and candid with each other  and to accept criticism as a positive force and failure as part of the creative process   Research shows that positive moods make us more open to learning new things and considering a broader set of options  They make us more receptive to both criticism and opposing points of view  In contrast  negative moods narrow our mindset  focusing on problems rather than possibilities   Teresa Amabile  an expert in the study of effect of emotional states on work  suggests that creativity and positive emotions may act as a feedback loop  creative tasks can make you feel more positive  while feeling positive makes you more likely to be creative  In addition  positive emotions can help us develop psychological and social resources that outlast our temporary happiness  So we may be more creative in the future  thanks to a positive state of mind now   Similarly  psychologist Barbara Fredrickson s research has shown the myriad benefits of positive emotions on individuals  work  creativity  and overall well being   They feel more effective at what they do  They re better able to savor the good things in life and can see more possible solutions to problems  And they sleep better   Fredrickson teamed up with psychologist and business consultant Marcial Losada to see how the impact of positivity on individuals transferred to team dynamics  Losada studied 60 different teams while they conducted annual strategic planning meetings  a process that requires a great deal of collaborative creativity to be successful   His team observed and recorded the meetings behind one way glass and classified each statement made as being  positive    negative   or  neutral   They also classified statements based on two other key criteria   Was the speaker focused inward on the group itself or was he or she outward  taking into account the larger context the surrounding the organization  Was the speaker focused on advocating his or her own point of view  or was he or she asking questions and actively gathering new information   The researchers then ranked each team s subsequent performance based on independent business metrics  High performing teams had a positive to negative statement ratio of about six to one  In contrast  more than half of the statements made in low performing teams were negative   In addition  individuals on high performing teams balanced their statements between asking questions and advocating their own point of view and between an internal focus on the group and an external focus on the larger context within which the company operated  Low performing teams did the exact opposite  they tended to focus inward on the group  almost never asked questions  and advanced their own point of view almost exclusively    None of them were listening to each other   Fredrickson says   They were all just waiting to talk    That s not to say that team must be positive at all times in order to be successful  negative emotions do have their place in the creative process  Some studies have shown that  neutral or mildly negative moods can be more effective for tasks such as systematic analysis   since they make us  less prone to errors in judgement  more accurate when recalling events  and better able to craft higher quality  persuasive arguments    Yet when negativity becomes the dominant mood  teams quickly fall into a downward spiral of negativity  narrow mindedness  and self advocacy  To uncover creative solutions  effective managers create positive team cultures that foster an openness to new ideas  encourage questions  and help employees think more broadly about about the challenge at hand   When you unpack the stories behind creative teams  the winding path to innovation tends to be equal parts science  art  and luck  However  there are things you as a leader can do to create a culture of active engagement  debate  questioning  and open mindedness that surfaces those elusive creative ideas that set companies apart   As Yahoo  CEO Marissa Meyer puts it   While we need  constraints  to spur passion and insight  we also need a sense of hopefulness to keep us engaged and unwavering in our search for the right idea  Innovation is born from the interaction between constraint and vision   We hope this article gave you some concrete ideas for getting started   About the

1088,training-dataset/product/1294.txt,product,Designing innovation inside your companyWhy is innovation so hard  Every team who hasn t  can t  or won t innovate has a story about why the overused  i  word continues to elude them   At New Haircut  we work with major companies to create innovative design  and the most common problem we see is that companies design stagnation into their organizational stories instead of innovation   For example  a major worldwide financial institution s marketing director told me  Having 200 global stakeholders per project makes it nearly impossible to innovate   A CEO of a Fortune 100 AdTech company told me  We just can t get focused  Our business stakeholders are constantly caught up in too many different things   A VP of a 55 000 person global organization told me  We tried everything  We acquired companies  We hired management consultants and watched them spend weeks generating user journeys we didn t need  We spent a ton of money building an innovation lab in NYC that can t seem to connect with our core culture   By focusing on the reasons innovation can t succeed  companies set themselves up for failure and stagnation   Anyone can fail  It s not only the Fortune 500s that stagnate  Remember Foursquare  Groupon  These companies launched their products and consumers went nuts  How many group deals did your crazy cousin send for saving 15  if you could round up 10 friends to join you at Six Flags  People couldn t check in fast enough to become the mayor of their local Walgreens   That was all cool for a minute  but then what happened  A couple years went by and neither Foursquare or Groupon made the necessary leaps forward to stay relevant  Both companies built massive audiences  but their products didn t evolve with those customers  Small updates like new badges will only take a company so far   Likewise  we ve seen the same trend of  small releases at the cost of innovation  at companies big and small and across all sectors   For instance  Apple may still be printing their own money  but die hard brand loyalists from the era of former CEO Steve Jobs have been a waiting a long time for the next iPhone caliber announcement  Meanwhile  competitors like Samsung continue to lure people away from iOS with new technology and different pricing models   In another example  Coach is a luxury retail brand that can t seem to connect with younger women  no matter which top models they hire  While they continue to focus on opening more stores that offer the same expensive bags  brands like Sephora are pushing boundaries with concepts that roll out of their innovation lab   Why do some companies go cold   So that gets us to the real question   how is one company the darling of its customers one year and all but forgotten the next   Sometimes it s because markets dry up  But most times it s because the people making critical decisions inside a company stop trying and stop prioritizing innovation  Or  as Angela Lee Duckworth posits  they lose their grit   They want to sell more  grow faster  create new  and stay ahead  But they stopped doing the things they did to get on top   This is typically what happens   They now operate based on what s least risky  They stopped talking to their customers  They package and repackage the same products ad nauseum  They rush into new markets and lose focus of their core  They hire more managers than makers  And then one day  two years after the company s last good idea  someone in a leadership meeting asks   How did we lose 30  market share to this puny little startup     That s typically when stories fly and fingers point  It s also when people get fired  It s when acquisitions of younger  hungrier competitors are approved  And it s when expensive management consultants are hired   But for most companies  especially the larger ones  by that time the bleeding has already begun  Attempts to buy innovation through acquisitions will not help to cauterize the wound  Neither will appointing a Chief Innovation Officer who lacks any real authority or persuasion in the company   Bill Burnett of Stanford s D School describes this downward spiral of innovation failure as death by a thousand cuts  Most importantly  he highlights that if you want to incite breakthroughs you need to cultivate a culture of leaders that not only welcome experimentation and failure  but are willing to share and learn from those failures repeatedly   Vulnerability s role in innovation  So how can teams solve the innovation issue before it gets to the stagnation point   What we ve learned is that real growth happens only when we re willing to do things we ve never done before  When we re willing to lose control  look stupid  and fail miserably  When we become comfortable with being uncomfortable   In her books The Power of Vulnerability and Daring Greatly  Dr  Bren  Brown shares stories about company leaders who want to innovate and create a culture that breeds creativity  She emphasizes the role of vulnerability and why the most innovative teams in the world display that trait in spades   When Ed Catmull started Pixar  he and his team including Steve Jobs had zero experience building  marketing  and selling their product  But they were willing to try and fail until they got it right  Not only did they eventually get it right  but generations of executives and entrepreneurs decades later are inspired by the story they tell in Creativity  Inc   Too often  teams and executives are hesitant to be vulnerable  perhaps worried they might expose the things they re not capable of  But look at Ed Catmull  Look at Steve Jobs  Look at Tim Ferris or any of the 200 people he interviewed in Tools of Titans  Vulnerability matters  and it s at the heart of lasting innovation for companies   It s also important to remember that there s no magic bullet  There s no company you can purchase or person you can hire that will transform your company into an innovative juggernaut overnight  It s a process  It s a formula you customize  experiment with  and learn from  And if it s going to work for your organization  you re going to need to inspire others to join you   Your role in inspiring innovation  If you want to help jolt your company out of hibernation  the people and teams around you will need to adopt habits of vulnerability  empathy  and curiosity  You want to move toward becoming a culture that invests in and rallies behind principles like design thinking  Then action is required  Planning  researching  and talking all matter but if you suspect your team is focused more on why you can t innovate than moving forward  then it s time to get busy doing   This is generally a little easier if you re already a company leader with the authority to effect change  but what if one of these applies to you   Your environment is completely toxic and a place where innovative ideas go to die   You re pretty junior a UX design intern or a junior account executive  for instance without a shred of influence in your company s planning  priorities  or resources   You know you re a central  influential person in your company  but your initiatives to boost innovation get no backup from management i e  you re influential but lacking true authority   If any of those describe you  here s a potential path to leading innovation from within   Double dip  Next time your boss asks you to work on a project  deliver using the traditional methods your boss expects but also spend nights and weekends experimenting with new tools and techniques  Whenever you uncover anything better and unexpected  present the results of both approaches to your boss  Once they re dazzled  request permission to help others the methods you tested  Build a team  If the double dipping paid off  hopefully your boss now knows what you re capable of  Your co workers will also appreciate your help and won t mind following your lead  Once they benefit from your experiments  they ll be primed to be part of your innovation lab  Build a lab  You re ready to officially recruit your team  They ve seen the benefits of innovation and are inspired to see these changes permeate throughout the company  Like you  they re willing to experiment  fail  report back  learn  and adapt  The lab can offer to take on experimental side projects with tremendous upside  but no real consequences if you have to go in a different direction  You can invite influencers into the lab to witness your successes and watch those influencers promote your ideas across the organization   The innovation mindset  Innovation is less a destination than a mindset  The people on your team and in your organization need to learn to ask great questions   They need to be interested in the habits of your customers only then can you identify new problems and offer new solutions   We have a lot to learn from the rare leaders who can inspire innovation in their organizations  and we all have the power to be that change for our own teams   This article was inspired by the following amazing minds,"[1088 70 179 110 228 287 592 403 625 976 630]"
1118,training-dataset/business/945.txt,business,How to design effective teams using positive psychologyAll effective teams have shared aims  efficient decision making processes  and clearly communicated roles and responsibilities   Believe it or not  that s the easy part   In comparison  it s much harder to   Hire people you know will succeed Build a team of people who are compatible  Today  we re going to explore how positive psychology can help you accomplish these 2 tasks  By the end of this post  you ll be prepared to design an effective team using positive psychology   What is positive psychology   In theory  psychologists study human behavior  They want to know how our minds interpret our experiences and influence our actions  But in reality  most psychologists focus on our problems  They look for developmental abnormalities that cause psychological disorders   Positive psychologists are different  They strive to discover how we can be happier and more productive by recognizing our virtues  developing our strengths  and embracing positivity   In many respects  they re the growth hackers of the social sciences  They ask questions like  How can we leverage our strengths to boost productivity   Positive psychologists   are the growth   hackers   of the social sciences     psychology  growth   Jes Kirkwood   jeskirkwood  August 13  2016  Throughout this article  you ll learn about psychological assessments that can help you evaluate employees   Now that we ve established a framework  let s look at each task in depth   Step 1  Hire people you know will succeed  Effective teams consist of successful employees   These employees balance quality work with getting the job done  They set realistic objectives  then they work hard to exceed them  And they spend time outside of work developing their skills and expertise   Successful employees have 4 common characteristics   Job fit  Job fit refers to the compatibility between an employee and their duties   Job fit   refers to the compatibility    between an employee   and his or her duties   hr  psychology   Jes Kirkwood   jeskirkwood  August 13  2016  A strong job candidate fit contributes to increased performance and employee satisfaction  It also decreases the likelihood that the individual will quit his or her job prematurely   To evaluate job fit  ask yourself these 2 questions   Can the candidate meet the demands of the position  Will the position meet the needs of the candidate   If your answer to both questions is yes  there s a strong fit between the candidate and the job a good sign that the candidate will be successful   Culture fit  Culture fit refers to the compatibility between an employee and the organization they belong to   To evaluate culture fit  consider how easy it would be for a candidate to integrate into your organization  It may be helpful to ask yourself questions like  Do they share our values  Our beliefs  How might they respond to our practices   Consider these 2 examples   If you have an open floor plan  you may not want to hire someone who is extremely introverted or accustomed to working remotely  This candidate may struggle to be productive in a distracting environment  Someone who is accustomed to traditional team settings may not appreciate remote work  This candidate may struggle to perform without the ability to throw ideas back and forth with colleagues   Passion    Passionate employees have interests that they re motivated to invest in   People are much more engaged at work when they get to explore their interests  But it s important that they re motivated to invest in those interests  Why  Because if they aren t  they re unlikely to waste their time exploring their interests outside of work  That means it ll take them much longer to build the expertise required to do their job well   Here s an example  I love to sing  In fact  singing certain songs gives me shivers all over my body  Sometimes I even cry that s how much it moves me  I m not a great singer  by any means  But then again  I ve never had singing lessons  Why  Because it s super unlikely I d ever  make it  in the industry  In other words  I m not motivated to invest in my interest  because I know that investment will reap no rewards   I don t need to be a great singer to enjoy it    The truth is  most people only invest in the interests that advance their goals  Everything else gets pushed to the side   Skill  Skilled employees systematically develop their strengths over time   Employees who regularly use their strengths are more satisfied and less likely to quit their jobs  That means you ll spend less time and money hiring and training new employees   Enabling your employees to use their strengths also boosts firm productivity by 12 5   If that doesn t sway you  I don t know what will   So what exactly are strengths  They re innate abilities that can be developed into advanced competencies  For example  I have a natural aptitude for strategic thinking  My wife  on the other hand  is a fantastic relationship builder   The Clifton StrengthsFinder  assessment can help you discover your employees  unique strengths   Each strength falls into one of 4 categories   Executing  People with executing strengths work hard to make things happen  Influencing  People with influencing strengths lead others in thought and action  Relationship building  People with relationship building strengths bring people together and enhance relationships  Strategic thinking  People with strategic thinking strengths continuously absorb and assess information  which helps organizations make better decisions   It s far better to invest in developing your employees  strengths than to invest in their weaknesses  Here s why  Weaknesses can be moderately improved  at best  If developed  strengths can become advanced competences   Mike could learn effective sales techniques  But he s very nervous when interacting with people for the first time  That s why it s unlikely that he will ever become a high performing sales representative  Working in sales is also unlikely to fulfill Mike  In fact  he might end up hating his job   On the other hand  Joe is a natural networker who enjoys attending industry events  If he was taught effective sales techniques  he could lead the sales team within 5 years   That s why developing your employees  strengths is a much better investment   Before you can build an effective team  you need high performing players  So next time you consider hiring a new employee  revisit these 4 characteristics  Ask yourself  Does the candidate have both passion and skill  Is the candidate well suited to the position  Will the candidate thrive in your organization  If the answer is yes to all 4 questions  don t hesitate to make an offer   But keep in mind  It s not always appropriate to hire high performance candidates  When hiring for entry level positions  you should look for high potential candidates  those with culture fit  job fit  and passion who ve yet to develop their strengths  Given more time and experience  they could become star players   Step 2  Build a team of people who are compatible  Effective teams consist of compatible team members   I can hear you protesting  As long as my employees behave like professionals  it shouldn t matter  Right   Wrong   Have you ever been on a team where people just couldn t seem to get along  Incompatibility has the potential to derail even the simplest of projects  That s why you must select employees who are going to work well together   In reality  we re all products of our environments social as well as physical environments  If the environment is right for a particular candidate  they re sure to thrive  But if the environment is wrong  they re certain to fail   Psychological compatibility reduces relationship conflict while producing the conditions for harmonious interactions  That s why it s critical to get this step right   While the Myers Briggs Type Indicator   MBTI  assessment is often used by individuals to assess their personalities  it s equally valuable for assessing compatibility between employees   16Personalities provides a free version of this assessment online  It s not identical to the MBTI   but it s a helpful tool nonetheless   These assessments evaluate people across 4 dimensions   Extroversion Introversion  The extroversion introversion dimension evaluates how a person is energized   Extroverted  E   Extroverts clarify their ideas through discussion  They get assurance from others  and prefer to work in team settings   Extroverts clarify their ideas through discussion  They get assurance from others  and prefer to work in team settings  Introverted  I   Introverts must develop their thoughts before discussing them  They are self assured individuals who prefer to work alone   Sensing Intuition  The sensing intuition dimension evaluates how a person makes sense of their environment   Sensing  S   Sensing people focus on the present moment  They are driven by observable data  and tend to be detail oriented   Sensing people focus on the present moment  They are driven by observable data  and tend to be detail oriented  Intuition  N  Intuitive people envision what the future could hold  They are concept driven and imaginative  and tend to concentrate on the bigger picture   Feeling Thinking  The feeling thinking dimension evaluates how a person makes decisions   Feeling  F   Feeling people make decisions based on subjective values  They enjoy working in cooperation with others  and tend to evaluate the world through the lens of justice   Feeling people make decisions based on subjective values  They enjoy working in cooperation with others  and tend to evaluate the world through the lens of justice  Thinking  T  Thinking people make decisions based on objective logic  They are critical thinkers who prefer solving problems over engaging with people   Perceiving Judging  The perceiving judging dimension evaluates how a person operates on a daily basis   Perceiving  P   Perceiving people are open to change  They find it easy to adapt to new circumstances  and are naturally curious about the world  They tend to collect lots of information before making decisions   Perceiving people are open to change  They find it easy to adapt to new circumstances  and are naturally curious about the world  They tend to collect lots of information before making decisions  Judging  J   Judging people require structure and routine  They are decisive by nature  but often craft detailed plans that can be easily followed before acting   Keep in mind  In many cases  people become less extreme and more balanced as they develop  The result  Variable personality traits  For example  ambiverts are people who are equally introverted and extroverted   The 4 dimensions combine to produce 16 unique personality types   Let s review how these types interact   With few exceptions  sensing  S  and intuitive  N  types don t get along  That s a difficult pill to swallow especially in an industry where designers and developers must work together  Many designers are intuitive feeling  NF  types  while many developers are sensing thinking  ST  types  Unfortunately  these 2 types don t work well together   Here s how you can resolve this issue  Hire people who can bridge the gap between incompatible types   Intuitive thinking  NT  types are ideal for this role  They have moderately successful relationships with all MBTI  types  That s part of the reason they make great leaders  Because they can relate to everyone   Intuitive  N  types are also skilled at bridging communication gaps between their colleagues  For this reason  they often act as in office translators   MBTI  Intuitive  N  types are skilled    at bridging communication   gaps  They often act as office translators     hr  career  psychology   Jes Kirkwood   jeskirkwood  August 13  2016  It s also important to understand how your leaders  MBTI  results will influence your organization s culture   CPP s L4 Strategy Model analyzes the relationship between the intuition sensing  N S  and feeling thinking  F T  dimensions and an organization s culture   According to their research   Sensing Feeling  SF  types foster cooperative cultures  Sensing Thinking  ST  types foster consistent cultures  Intuitive Feeling  NF  types foster inspirational cultures  Intuitive Thinking  NT  types foster achievement cultures  Whether you re building an executive team or hiring 2 mid level managers to jointly oversee one functional area  understanding the interactions between these types of leaders can help you foster a thriving organizational culture   For example  similar types tend to work well together  This is true for thinking  T   intuitive  N   and sensing  S  types  But feeling  F  types who are paired together may experience conflict   Opposites sometimes attract  but not always  While sensing feeling  SF  and intuitive thinking  NT  leaders work well together  sensing thinking  ST  and intuitive feeling  NF  leaders butt heads   When building an effective team  you need to consider how team members will interact  Once you ve assessed each team member using the MBTI  assessment  you can put complementary people on the same team,"[1118 287 587 403 625 592 784 179 630 976 196]"

1227,training-dataset/product/1312.txt,product,Building Happy Product Teams like Heist Teams by Laura Klein230 Flares 230 Flares    Laura Klein has been an engineer  researcher  designer  product manager and consultant  which means she s worked with a lot of teams  But what makes a happy team  In writing her next book  Building Better Products   she donned her research hat and interviewed a number of product teams around the world  In this talk at Mind the Product San Francisco  she shared some of her insights from that research into what makes happy product teams  and surprisingly how close they come to those heist teams we see in movies like Oceans 11 or The Italian Job   1  Goal  All great heist teams have a clear  obvious  challenging goal  They usually start with a meeting that brings together the whole team to lay out the goal and the plan for achieving it  So happy product teams know what success looks like  and they feel like they re a part of making it come true  One slightly dangerous finding in Laura s research is that having something really hard to do tends to bring a team together  Sometimes having a barely achievable goal is better than something easy but the trick is getting the balance right   no one wants to be constantly challenged and stressed  But the occasional project with a really ambitious but reachable goal is a great way to bond a team   2  Respect   Trust  Heist teams are made up of experts  and they know they re experts  which makes the team respect one another  Unsurprisingly expertise and the respect and trust that come with that expertise were common themes in Laura s research  with 80  of participants citing it as a key component of their favourite teams  Happy teams respect and trust each other because they are made up of people who know what they re doing  Interestingly  these teams were also better at managing people who weren t experts  for example helping junior team members excel in the team  As a side benefit  since everyone trusted each other there was very little second guessing of decisions since they were made by the person with the appropriate expertise   3  Balance  When heist team plans center around everything happening in precise order  they synchronise their watches and then everyone gets on with their job  So happy product teams balance the time they spend together and apart  They make the plan together  check in regularly but leave each other to get on with it  The best teams align in person  work it out separately  and check in daily   4  Incentives  Most heist teams fail because of misaligned incentives  Whether they failed due to micromanaging  anarchy or being too communal  dysfunctional teams often fell apart because they incentivised the wrong behaviour  So instead of incentivising individual performance or goals  happy product teams focus on incentives that encourage collaboration and alignment with the team s goals   What makes heists harder   So what s going to stop you from the heist of a lifetime  While everyone can get on board with hiring the best and letting them get on with the work  there are certain structural issues that do make building successful teams harder   Remote working  Very few of the people Laura interviewed cited remote teams as their favourites  and many cited them as the most difficult  In general  remote teams leads to less respect and trust  and there is of course all sorts of confusion caused by timezones and different nationalities and cultures  There are fixes for this  but it takes concerted effort  Teams where everyone was remote worked best  as it levels the playing field and forces everyone to over communicate  Teams that spread skills across locations tended to work better than grouping all engineers in one place  all designers in another etc  And of course remote teams that invested in spending time together  face to face  on a regular basis helped build that trust and respect even when they went back to working remotely   External stakeholders  Another major hurdle for great teams was non team based stakeholders  otherwise known as clients  management  or other departments  Many teams are encumbered with decision makers that aren t in the team and thus aren t available which erodes their ability to execute  Another problem is when stakeholders come out of the woodwork months later and derail a project  The key way to solve this is to spend the time to identify all the stakeholders up front  and making sure to check in regularly so that you avoid being blindsided by changes in the stakeholders  requirements   Silos  You can t pull off a heist with 30 safecrackers and no one to drive the getaway car  No successful product team is entirely made up of product managers  designers  or engineers  Company structure can get in the way  especially where departments get siloed  The best and happiest teams are ones that are balanced  cross functional  and together for long enough to build that trust and respect   Why bother   Is all this hard work building and aligning happy product teams worth it  Is there a correlation between happy teams and success  Sadly Laura s research found no such correlation  As we all know there are a huge number of factors that go into building a successful product  and whether the team is happy is probably one of them  but by no means the only one  However  her research did uncover some clear tangible benefits from happy teams   Happy teams are resilient  Whether they succeeded or failed  happy teams kept going  If they re not successful the first time  they keep working at it  and keep trying to achieve their goals   Happy teams are more open to feedback  When people respect each other they re better at accepting criticism and feedback  and become better at their job  This raises everyone s skills and improves individual as well as team output   Happy teams are more likely to stay  A lot of the sad team stories ended with team members  or even entire teams  quitting  You can t build a good product that way  If you build a happy team they ll stick together and keep working at it   So go back to your product teams  make sure they re empowered to succeed  and pull off that heist of a lifetime,"[1227 403 228 420 784 177 287 196 1406 1264 630]"
1264,training-dataset/engineering/1069.txt,engineering,The Quora Engineering GuildsAt Quora  as our product continues to grow to over 100M unique users per month  launching in a second language  and a new advertising program so too has our engineering organization grown  It s now reached over 80 people and counting  and while we re not at the tens of thousands size of some of our Mountain View neighbors  in recent months we ve needed to fine tune some elements of our organization to stay in a good position to scale and continue growing  In this post  I ll give a quick overview of how our engineering organization is structured  and then focus on one part we re particularly excited about  our Engineering Guilds   Product teams    The main divisions in our organization are product teams  Product teams include everyone needed to work on a development area  which includes engineers  product managers  designers  and data scientists  These teams are in charge of owning both maintenance and innovation within their product area  and they grow and change to reflect changing company wide priorities and strategy  For example  a few months ago  we started a new Ads team to implement our monetization strategy based on advertising     Some product teams are focused on user facing features  such as search or feed ranking  while other product teams focus on strictly technical aspects  For example  our Platform team is in charge of developing tools and abstractions to improve the productivity of the rest of the development team  which includes everything from native mobile development to continuous deployment tools  This team is composed mainly of engineers  but it also has designers  product managers  and data scientists   The problem with teams    Having focused teams is great  Many successful companies  such as Amazon and Netflix  are based on this idea of having very autonomous and independent teams that have a lot of freedom  This kind of organization improves agility  one of our company values  since small focused teams can move faster  It also promotes drive and pragmatism  two more of our values  since teams own their product mostly end to end  feel ownership  and do whatever is needed to make it work     So  what s wrong with that  Well  as anyone who has been at any product based organization can tell you  isolation between teams can cause problems  Let s see an example   Team A is working on a problem and gets to a point where they realize that existing open source implementations are not fast enough  They have no alternative but to code an efficient implementation from the ground up  The team decides to use C   for performance reasons  At the same time  Team B gets to a point where they also need similar functionality  They decide to use an existing open source implementation in Python  The performance isn t great  but they prefer to deal with this than to implement something from scratch  At some point Team B learns about the internal implementation Team A has done  Unfortunately  all their infrastructure has already been set up exclusively to work with Python  They would have used the efficient C   implementation had they known in time  but now it s too late   Similar situations that involve getting many teams on the same page happen often in organizations with a focus on product areas  Here are some typical scenarios   A system could be reused among many more teams than the one that originally designed it  but that team does not have the time or incentives to generalize it   A large code migration that affects many teams needs to be done  but it is hard to impose on each team s schedule and priorities   Engineers implement duplicated features over and over because it is hard to  a  find out whether they already exist  and  b  integrate existing features from other teams   It is hard to ensure engineers across the organization have shared knowledge of underlying approaches or technologies and keep up with constant changes to the codebase   All of these situations are negative examples of another one of our company values  awareness  If teams are extremely focused  they might become too isolated  making it harder for information and communication to flow easily through the company and ultimately making it difficult for anyone to be aware of what is going on     A common solution to some of the issues above is the matrix organization  While its mechanism for connecting vertical teams is valuable  we found that the approach of adding horizontal teams created too much extra complexity in the organization  We ve instead solved these problems by introducing a new structure we call guilds     The engineering guilds  We define engineering guilds as flexible associations of Quora engineers that share a particular technical focus  independent of the team they are on  Broadly  each guild is responsible for sharing knowledge across product teams that are working in similar technical areas  as well as coordinating staffing changes  As of today  we have 5 guilds   Frameworks Engineering  Machine Learning Engineering  Native Mobile Engineering  Product Engineering  Systems Engineering  Every engineer has a primary guild at any point in time  This guild is selected by each engineer s manager after taking into account their preferences and background  Encouraging all engineers to have a primary guild has also had other benefits that we didn t initially anticipate  such as giving people a better high level view of the organization and streamlining project staffing  In addition to selecting a primary guild  engineers can also choose secondary guild s   We don t recommend having too many secondary guilds  since it s good for engineers to have a certain degree of focus  but we do have engineers who are actively involved in as many as three different guilds     With this organization  it s clear that teams will have engineers from a variety of guilds  Some focused teams might have most of their engineers focused on one or two guilds  while teams with more cross cutting work will include members of several guilds  like systems  frameworks  and machine learning  The figure below is an example organization of product teams and guilds that s somewhat similar to where we stand today at Quora   All engineering managers are members of guilds as well  and each guild is led by an engineering manager     Besides this high level organization design  guilds are completely free to organize themselves and their activities however they want  We have no other prescriptions on what they should or should not do  since requirements may be completely different from one guild to another  With that said  most of the guilds have agreed on a number of activities that are helpful   Mailing lists or Slack channels  Weekly or biweekly meetings  External and or internal learning talks  Reading learning groups  Technical reviews where new systems or approaches from a team are discussed within the guild  The machine learning guild  In order to understand a bit more how guilds have self organized  let s take a look at the machine learning guild and some of the activities it runs     The ML guild coordinates all of our activities related to machine learning  as well as related areas such as natural language processing  It currently has around 20 engineers  out of our current total of around 80 engineers  and four managers  Since one of the main objectives of guilds is to share knowledge across the engineering organization  the ML guild is very active in organizing trips to ML conferences  bringing in external speakers  and sharing research  Whether through casual messages in the guild s Slack channel or hour long presentations in the weekly guild meetings  the ML guild promotes machine learning knowledge across the company  Many of these discussions lead to documentation describing general ML related topics like the qualitative evaluation of models or ML complexity  which we ve recently shared on our engineering blog     While many of the guild s discussions are targeted at experienced ML engineers  the guild also promotes general ML education for people new to ML at Quora  or even new to ML in general  For example  the ML guild has organized various talks and trainings to introduce attendees to machine learning systems like answer ranking and feed   The Machine Learning Guild in action    The ML guild also makes investments to improve machine learning development velocity  For example  the guild has taken ownership of the cluster of machines that is shared across all ML teams for development  training  and analysis  the ML guild is responsible for defining how that cluster is shared and maintained  The ML guild also organizes Technical Reviews  where teams present proposals for a new systems or refactors to get feedback from people across the company     Another responsibility of the guild is enabling flexible staffing across the different teams that have ML engineers  If one team needs more ML resources  the request will go to the guild  which will act as a load balancer to manage different requirements and needs across teams  Similarly  the ML guild is involved in recruiting  which includes helping hiring managers work together and assigning incoming candidates to the right teams  Finally  the guild is responsible for defining the interview loop for our machine learning roles     Conclusions    Engineering guilds have improved knowledge sharing and communication between teams dramatically  With little investment  we have become a much more efficient  flexible  and scalable organization  In fact  guilds at Quora have become so successful that we are now pushing more and more responsibilities onto them     In our experience  guilds as described in this post are an easy way to supplement and improve organizations that are based on focused and independent teams  We look forward to continuing to use guilds as a way to grow Quora and  ultimately  the world s knowledge  Check out our careers page if you d like to join us in our mission     Credits    We take inspiration from looking at how many other companies are set up  Guilds in particular were inspired by Spotify  They have a complex organizational structure with many different artifacts  We did not implement any of the other parts  but found guilds to solve exactly the problems that we were facing,"[1264 1227 228 403 420 196 784 179 287 1406 177]"

1406,training-dataset/business/1367.txt,business,Eight common dysfunctions of design teams  and what to do about them Eight common dysfunctions of design teams  and what to do about them   As a design partner at GV  I ve worked with more than 100 startups in the past five years  Before that  I was a design lead on teams at YouTube and Google  and an early employee at FeedBurner  a startup in Chicago   In other words  I ve seen a lot of design teams in action over the past decade  The people on these teams are invariably talented  smart  and hard working  But having great people doesn t guarantee great teamwork   I ve come to recognize eight common dysfunctions of design teams  Fortunately  I ve also seen solutions to these dysfunctions   proven  reliable  and simple techniques that teams can use to work better together  And finally  I ve translated these ideas into a set of mantras that capture the best behaviors of successful design teams   1  The  everybody knows  fallacy  When we start a project  we assume that everyone shares the same understanding of the problem and goal  The truth is that knowledge is not distributed evenly on a team   everybody knows different things  Even on teams that communicate well  there s rarely an opportunity to unpack all this knowledge for the benefit of the group   Solution  Assemble a cross functional team  then interview your teammates and write down what you learn   Mantra   Get the right people in the room    2  Starting with solutions  Design teams are full of enthusiastic  creative problem solvers  Our instinct is to kick off a project by thinking of solutions right away  It s a lot of fun  and it feels like an efficient way to work  Unfortunately  it s not the best use of everyone s problem solving energy  Without a good understanding of the problem  we get solutions that are all over the map   some good  some bad  and some solving the wrong problem   Solution  Understand the problem  Talk about your goals  metrics  and questions for the project  Map out the problem before you create solutions   Mantra   Start at the end    3  Brainstorming  Research back to 1958 shows that group brainstorming produces ideas that are inferior to good old fashioned solo work  but we do it anyway  We can t resist   Solution  Ask individuals to work on their own  then record  vote  and combine ideas  Avoid unstructured group discussions   Mantra   Individual work is better than group work    4  Premature commitment  In our march toward solving a problem  we re too likely to get stuck on the first reasonable solution that comes along  Many teams explore a range of ideas  but they ll commit to one before validating or evaluating the others in detail  In other words  premature narrowing is often the cause of premature commitment   Solution  Create time and structure to capture competing solutions to a problem in detail   Mantra   Diverge before you decide    5  Groupthink  Groups are no good at making decisions   at least not the way we normally do it  We want everyone to be happy  so we talk and talk until we ve reached consensus on a decision  And we let social dynamics get in the way  power relationships  seniority  loud mouths  etc  This all leads to decisions that nobody is excited about  that don t reflect a unique  opinionated perspective   Solution  Use voting to capture everyone s opinions  then lean on the decider to make the call   Mantra   Wisdom of the crowd without the groupthink    6  Polishing a brick  We spend way too long polishing and perfecting unproven solutions  It s understandable   we aim for a certain level of quality before releasing anything   but it s sadly common when we don t have a short term plan for testing our ideas   Solution  Set deadlines you can t get out of  Use a timer to keep track of activities  Create uninterrupted  deep work  time so you can really get stuff done   Mantra   Create time pressure    7  Shaky foundation  Every promising solution is built on a foundation of assumptions about our customer  our product  and our world  And that solution represents a hypothesis that we believe is true  i e   if we build this it will help our customers    But too often  design teams let these assumptions and hypotheses go untested  Instead of a solid foundation  we stand on a shaky foundation of things we believe to be true   but don t really know   Solution  Ask your team to list assumptions  hypotheses  and risks  Build prototypes you can use to test and validate   Mantra   The more we learn  the less we know    8  Obsessed with shipping  Shipping has achieved mythical importance  at least in our world of software products and digital services   Ship early  ship often    Move fast and break things   We re obsessed with shipping because we think it s the only way to truly test our ideas  It s fun  it s rewarding  and it gets us attention  But launching always takes longer than expected  and it s very difficult to un launch a product that s not working  Most importantly  measuring a live product won t tell us why it s working   or not working   Solution  Do a series of prototype and test loops before you commit to building and shipping something new   Mantra   Learn early  learn often,"[1406 630 1227 420 228 403 784 177 179 587 196]"
