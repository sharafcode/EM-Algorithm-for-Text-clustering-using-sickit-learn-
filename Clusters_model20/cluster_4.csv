481,training-dataset/business/441.txt,business,Apple Should Buy Netflix   Stratechery by Ben ThompsonWhile much of the focus of last Thursday s Apple announcement was on the new MacBook Pros  and the Macs that were not updated   the more interesting announcement from a strategic perspective was about Apple TV  Tim Cook stated Apple s goals plainly   We want Apple TV to be the one place to access all of your television  A unified TV experience  That s one place to access all of your TV shows and movies  One place to discover great new content to watch  So today we re announcing a new app and we simply call it  TV    After the app demo  Cook concluded   Apple TV  iPhone and iPad have become the primary ways that many of us enjoy watching television  and now with the TV app there s really no reason to watch TV anywhere else   Unless  of course  you want to watch Netflix   Apple s Leverage Playbook  There is a bit of a playbook to the way Apple comes to dominate industries  and it is founded on customer loyalty  The best example is  naturally  the iPhone   Back in 2006 Apple sought to release the original iPhone on Verizon  the leading carrier in the U S   though  was wary of Apple s demands that there be no Verizon branding  no Verizon control of the user experience  and no Verizon relationship with iPhone users beyond managing their data plan  Therefore  Apple launched the iPhone on the second place carrier  AT T n e Cingular   AT T accepted Apple s demands in full with the hope that Apple s famously loyal customers would see the iPhone as a reason to switch   That  of course  is exactly what happened  in the five years following the iPhone launch  AT T went from trailing Verizon by  400 million in wireless revenue to leading by  700 million  that s a  1 1 billion switch thanks in large part to Apple loyalists  willingness to switch carriers to get an iPhone  The effect was even greater on smaller carriers  which had no choice but to accede to Apple s increasingly demanding terms  not only would Apple own the customers  but carriers had to agree to significant marketing outlays and guaranteed sales to carry the iPhone   Apple repeated this formula in market after market  in Japan  for example  Softbank leveraged the iPhone to huge increases in market share  forcing NTT Docomo to finally give in to Apple s terms  Apple s leverage also played a role in bringing China Mobile to the negotiating table  along with Apple s ability to drive higher average selling prices for China Mobile s then new 4G network   The iPhone wasn t the first time Apple used this approach  perhaps the most famous example of Apple coming to dominate its suppliers was the iPod and iTunes Music Store  when Apple was able to leverage its loyal users to dictate terms to the music industry  In some respects this was the more impressive achievement  because while carriers are largely undifferentiated  presuming you live in a location with comparable coverage   music labels have exclusive rights to huge catalogs of music  This should  in theory  provide strong leverage in negotiations  but especially when the iTunes Music Store got started  the labels were terrified of the effect music piracy was having on their business  Apple offered a better alternative to piracy  and then grew so big the labels couldn t afford to not have their music on the iTunes Music Store   The problem Apple has in premium video   and given that the company has been trying and failing to secure video content on its terms for years now  it definitely has a problem   is that its executives seem to have forgotten just how important the piracy leverage was to the iTunes Music Store s success  This Wall Street Journal story from this past summer is one of many similar stories over the years detailing Apple s take it or leave it approach to premium video content    Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services Eddy  Cue is also known for a hard nosed negotiating style  One cable industry executive sums up Mr  Cue s strategy as saying   We re Apple  TV channel owners  kept looking at the Apple guys like   Do you have any idea how this industry works    one former Time Warner Cable executive says Mr  Cue has said the TV industry overly complicated talks   Time is on my side   he has told some media executives   Time may be on Apple s side  but the bigger issue for Cue and Apple is that leverage is not  that belongs to the company that is actually threatening premium content makers  Netflix  Netflix is the  piracy  of video content  but unfortunately for Apple they are a real company capable of using the leverage they have acquired   Netflix s Rise  Much like Apple vis   vis the music industry in the 2000s  Netflix got its start by being a friend to the industry it would eventually threaten  DVD sales simply added to the premium video industry s bottom line  and when the company made the leap to streaming it was through a deal with Starz that the latter basically viewed as found money  Streaming  though  was transformative to the user experience  while Starz had an 11 000 movie catalog  the effective catalog size was one   whatever was showing on the Starz linear TV channel  On Netflix  though  the effective size of the catalog was 11 000  Netflix customers could watch whichever movie they wished whenever they wished on any device they wished   That superior user experience drove Netflix s ever expanding user base  which gave the company the capability to acquire more content with money that was still pure profit for network owners  by the time said networks woke up to the fact that Netflix was devouring attention they were  like the music industry relative to Apple in the 2000s  increasingly captive to what was one of their biggest buyers  Netflix  meanwhile  was investing in its own original content  making deals with content creators directly  this strengthened Netflix s value proposition to customers  further weakened the negotiating power of networks  and laid the groundwork for Netflix to leverage the Internet to offer its service to nearly every customer on Earth   Netflix s strategy has been a textbook example of Aggregation Theory  Netflix has built leverage and monopsony power over the premium video industry not by controlling distribution  at least not at the beginning  but by delivering a superior customer experience that creates a virtuous cycle  Netflix earns the users  which increases its power over suppliers  which brings in more users  which increases its power even more   It is this virtuous cycle that drives Netflix s  54 billion valuation  which implies a sky high price to earnings ratio of 340  the company is spending billions on an ever increasing amount of original content that threatens to cut out networks entirely  leading Hollywood to fear a content monopoly  The big question is if Netflix has the financial firepower to pull it off  the company had   506 million in free cash flow last quarter thanks to its ongoing shift from licensing original content  which is pay on delivery  to self producting it  which requires investment months or years before the content is actually available   this shift gives Netflix even more leverage   and cuts out traditional networks even more   but it s expensive  and the company has to keep raising debt on the assumption subscriber numbers will increase enough to pay for it   There were mixed reports as to why Netflix is not in Apple s new  TV  app  Peter Kafka reported that Netflix was out even before Apple s event  while Netflix told Wired that the streaming service is  evaluating the opportunity    In fact  though  I suspect those reports aren t so different after all  Apple s desire to be  the one place to access all of your television  implies the disintermediation of Netflix to just another content provider  right alongside its rival HBO and the far more desperate networks who lack any sort of customer relationship at all  It is directly counter to the strategy that has gotten Netflix this far   owning the customer relationship by delivering a superior customer experience   and while Apple may wish to pursue the same strategy  the company has no leverage to do so  Not only is the Apple TV just another black box that connects to your TV  that is also the most expensive   it also  conveniently for Netflix  has a  relatively  open app platform  Netflix can deliver their content on their terms on Apple s hardware  and there isn t much Apple can do about it   The truth is that Apple s executives seem stuck in the iPod iTunes era  where selling 70  of all music players led to leverage over the music labels  with streaming content is available on any device at any time  which means that selling hardware isn t a point of leverage  If Apple wants its usual ownership of end users it needs to buy its way in  and that means buying Netflix   Why Apple Should Buy Netflix  I am  as a rule  skeptical of large acquisitions  they are all too often a byproduct of management empire building  and value destructive for shareholders  Moreover  not only do promised synergies often fail to materialize  but both the acquirer and the acquired are deeply distracted for years   I am even more dubious when an acquisition entails combining horizontal and vertical business models  horizontal business models  like Netflix s  entail reaching the maximum number of customers across all devices in order to better leverage up front costs  vertical business models  like Apple s  entail offering exclusive services to increase the differentiation of devices sold at a profit   So why am I advocating an acquisition that is both large and entails combining two orthogonal business models  Surprisingly  I think the argument for Apple is more compelling   As I argued earlier this year  the iPhone was the pinnacle of the product business model  it leveraged software to sell an incredible number of highly differentiated physical devices with a fabulous profit margin  in both percentage and absolute terms   but the future of high dollar physical goods is to be offered as a service  I strongly suspect this reality was an important reason for Apple s reset of the Apple Car project   In an ideal world one could argue that Apple should change its employees  compensation mix to more strongly favor high salaries over stock  dramatically increase its dividend program  and gracefully ride its hardware business model as long as it could  here on planet Earth Apple needs a growth engine to replace the iPhone  if not in reality than at least in potential   Apple is at its best when it is creating new products that are the best they can possibly be  it is a capability that is rather independent from Apple s biggest strategic assets  its dedicated user base and massive cash pile   A Netflix acquisition would   Give Apple one of the strongest entrants when it comes to business models of the future  Provide a far more compelling growth narrative than its current hardware business  particularly given the advantages Apple gives Netflix  which I will discuss below   Leverages Apple s assets in a way that leaves the product company free to focus on what it does best  The payoff for Netflix is more straightforward   As I noted above  Netflix s valuation is already sky high  with a stock so volatile that CEO Reed Hastings felt compelled to apologize to investors on Netflix s recent earnings calls  The issue is that Netflix s potential is massive for all the reasons I described above  but realizing that potential entails spending money the company hopes to gain from future subscribers  Ergo  any surprises in churn or new user numbers send the stock on a roller coaster  Having Apple s financial backing will alleviate those concerns   Apple s bank account will also allow Netflix to accelerate its strategy of complete ownership of original content  As I hinted at above  most original Netflix content to date has been licensed  not owned  which is problematic in two ways  first  Netflix faces some restrictions on said content  whether it be a temporal license or a geographic one  Secondly  Netflix isn t realizing the full profit from its original content  in perpetuity  given Netflix s business model is so powerful precisely because content is valuable not only when it is shown the first time but every time thereafter  this is an unfortunate giveaway dictated by Netflix s meager cash position  With Apple behind it Netflix could pursue the same strategy it used for this summer s Stranger Things  produce content without any middle men  and reap the proceeds   and leverage the freedom   forever   While Apple should keep Netflix cross platform  limiting Netflix to Apple devices would be massively value destructive   Netflix s value is predicated on being everywhere   and not even that helpful given that Apple s devices already dominate their price points   that doesn t mean that making Netflix available by default on every Apple device wouldn t have the potential to drive Netflix subscriptions  This could be especially effective internationally where Apple s brand is much stronger than Netflix s   Make no mistake  this would be a massive deal  Apple would probably need to pay a 20  premium at a minimum  which means an acquisition price north of  65 billion  and I d bet higher   And yet  the biggest reason I m skeptical it will happen is that I m not sure Netflix would say yes  the company has made it this far with a ladder up strategy predicated on delivering a superior customer experience  and provided the company can keep the cash flowing the leverage in video is all theirs  Granted  Amazon Prime Video is a big threat  particularly because their orthogonal business model and big company backing give them the ability to match Netflix dollar for dollar when it comes to acquiring content  but having made it thus far  does Hastings want to take the easy way now   As for Apple  Cook has been resolute in following the Steve Jobs playbook  which would seem to rule out a transformative acquisition of this nature  Still  strains are showing  in retrospect the Apple Watch was rushed to market  the company is raising prices to preserve margins and average selling prices  while the company seems to be cutting costs on the margins  Wouldn t it be a relief to sell a future based on more than squeezing the last drops of blood out of the iPhone rock  Indeed  the iPhone as cash cow and Netflix   run as an independent subsidiary   as growth driver would arguably create the greatest possible freedom to recreate the future once again,"[481 838 1105 1370 1038 299 1018 918 94 264 659]"

838,training-dataset/product/933.txt,product,B Testing   uxdesign ccHow Netflix does A B Testing  Have you ever wondered why Netflix has such a great streaming experience  Do you want to learn how they completed their homepage plus other UI layout redesigns through A B testing  If so  then this article is for you   I ll start with sharing my takeaways from a Designers Geeks event I attended last week at Yelp  The two great speakers Anna Blaylock and Navin Iyengar  both product designers at Netflix  walked through insights gleaned from their years of A B testing on tens of millions of Netflix members  and showed some relevant examples from the product to help attendees think about their own designs   Photo from the presentation  Experimentation  I really liked this first slide of the presentation and think it s smart to use an image from the TV show  Breaking Bad  to explain the concept of experimentation   Photo from the presentation  The Scientific Method  Photo from the presentation  Hypothesis  In science  a hypothesis is an idea or explanation that you then test through study and experimentation  In design  a theory or guess can also be called a hypothesis   Photo from the presentation  The basic idea of a hypothesis is that there is no pre determined outcome  It is something that can be tested and that those tests can be replicated    The general concept behind A B testing is to create an experiment with a control group and one or more experimental groups  called  cells  within Netflix  which receive alternative treatments  Each member belongs exclusively to one cell within a given experiment  with one of the cells always designated the  default cell   This cell represents the control group  which receives the same experience as all Netflix members not in the test     Netflix blog  Here s how A B testing is done at Netflix  as soon as the test is live  they track specific metrics of importance  For example  it could be elements like streaming hours and retention  Once the participants have provided enough meaningful conclusions  they move onto the efficacy of each test and define a winner out of the different variations   Image from the presentation  Photo from the presentation that shows the hypothesis process  Experiment  Experimentation is the act of experimenting  Many companies like Netflix run experiments to generate user data  It is also important to take time and effort to organize the experiment properly to ensure that both the type and amount of data is sufficient and available to clarify the questions of interest as efficiently as possible   You probably have noticed that the featured show on the Netflix homepage seems to change whenever you log in  They re all part of Netflix s complex experiments to get you to watch their shows   Homepage when I logged in the 1st time  Image from the presentation  the House of Cards page when seen as a signed out user  Home page when I logged in the 2nd time  Home page when I switch the account user name  Home page when I switch name to kids  Home page when I m not signed in  The idea of A B testing is to present different content to different user groups  gather their reactions and use the results to build strategies in the future  According to this blog post written by Netflix engineer Gopal Krishnan   If you don t capture a member s attention within 90 seconds  that member will likely lose interest and move onto another activity  Such failed sessions could at times be because we did not show the right content or because we did show the right content but did not provide sufficient evidence as to why our member should watch it   Netflix did an experiment back in 2013 to see if they can create a few artwork variants that increase the audience for a title  Here is the result   Image from Netflix blog  It was an early signal that members are sensitive to artwork changes  It was also a signal that there were better ways they could help Netflix members find the types of stories they were looking for within the Netflix experience   Netflix later created a system that automatically grouped artwork that had different aspect ratios  crops  touch ups  localized title treatments but had the same background image  They replicated experiment on their other TV shows to track relative artwork performance  Here are some examples   Image from Netflix blog  the two marked images significantly outperformed all others   Image from Netflix blog  the last marked images significantly outperformed all others   Check out these two blog posts to learn more about Netflix A B testing   How Netflix selects the best artwork for videos through A B testing  The Netflix experimentation platform  a service which makes it possible for every Netflix engineering team to implement their A B tests with the support of a specialized engineering team   What I learned  A B testing is the most reliable way to learn user behaviors  As designers  we should think about our work through the lens of experimentation   Image from the presentation  your instinct is not always right  When and why A B testing  Once you have a design in production  use A B testing to tweak the design and target two key metrics  retention and revenue  By A B testing changes throughout the product and tracking users over time  you can see whether your change improves retention or increases revenue  If it does  make it the default  In this way A B testing can be used to continuously improve business metrics  Are your users finding or doing one thing you want them to find or to do   My experience is that often times users cannot always complete a task as fast as you expect  and sometimes they can t even find a certain button you put on a page  The reasons can vary  it might because the design is not intuitive enough  the color is not vibrant enough  the user is not tech savvy  they don t know how to make a decision because there are too many options on one page  and so on  Are your intuitions correct   Sadly  when it comes to user behavior  our intuitions could be wrong  and the only way to prove it is through A B testing  It is the best way to validate whether one UX design is more effective than another  At work  our consumer product team have proved that through A B testing on our real estate website  For example  they wanted to figure out whether they can make a design change to improve the registration rate for users who clicked on a Google Ad  They created a few different experimental designs and tested them  They thought the design that only hides the property image would win  but found that the design that hides both the property image and the price got the highest conversation rate  Explore the boundaries  The best ideas come from many idea explorations  At work  our product team works collaboratively across many different projects  With so many parties involved  from designers to product managers to developers   we get to explore the boundaries together  Some of the best ideas are sometime from the developers or the product managers after testing out our prototypes  Observe what people do  not what they say  When talking to users  it s important to keep this in mind  they always say one thing but do it differently  I conducted a few user testing sessions this week and have one perfect example to show you why  I had this one user testing out a Contacts list view prototype and asked him if he usually sorts filters his Contacts  He said no because he wouldn t need do so  However  when he discovered the new filters dropdown menu  he was amazed by how convenient it is to sort and filter multiple options at a time and immediately asked when that can roll out in production  Use data to estimate size of opportunity    It s always about the whys    Data can help shape ideas    Check if any A B testing are in conflict  Isn t it so fun to be a UI and UX designer     Knowing your user is the most exciting part of design process  There is no finished design  but many chances for iteration to improve the design and give our users the best experience possible  I enjoy the opportunity to make subtle tweaks for our users  measure their reactions and work with the product team to figure out the next steps   If you like this article  please kindly tap the   button below,"[838 659 920 1206
