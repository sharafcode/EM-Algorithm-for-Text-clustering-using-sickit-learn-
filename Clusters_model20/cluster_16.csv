9,training-dataset/product/92.txt,product,A product team s friend or foe    Feature Request Management in SaaS   MediumRoadmaps  A product team s friend or foe   A great roadmap can drive a company s success  a bad one can cause disaster  Here s what we ve learned along the way   History of the product roadmap  I m not entirely sure there is a documented  history  of the product roadmap but they entered my world slowly  creeping in as a new  hip alternative to the traditional Gantt chart   the friend  or foe  of software development in an era most of us have now left behind   The technological advancements that led to quicker software delivery through a more agile approach naturally fell awkwardly against waterfall methods of project management  As a result  a new discipline of product management emerged and brought the product roadmap with it   The power of product roadmaps  At the heart of product management lies communication  Communicating what has been done  what s in progress and what is to come is a core skill which is difficult to master   especially with so many stakeholders in tow   A good product roadmap can be a key driver for successful product teams  amazing products and growing businesses  If roadmaps are produced and managed well  they keep customers   internal teams aligned and sell an appealing vision of the future   Projecting a coherent plan boosts confidence  gets prospects excited about where you are heading  shows customers you really deliver and keeps the team working towards the strategic goals set by the leadership team   These benefits come when roadmaps are handled well of course  When done badly  a roadmap can consume hours of a product team s time and become the source of much conflict   confusion   After many years on the road mapping coal face  it s time to share a few things we ve learned   Note that what is successful for one product   business might not be for another  I ve started a short survey for software product managers to learn more about how roadmaps are used   created  Take a look at   hannahchaplin typeform com to RSxk36   1   A product roadmap is a living document  Roadmaps evolve  https   giphy com  Never assume that your product roadmap is a fixed document  If you try to set things in stone  you can t react to new information that has become available  That isn t to say you should be changing the whole thing everyday though  Our process involves creating broad themes that we want to address often a quarter or two in advance  then we plan the features and detail in shorter term deliveries   This works really well because we have a direction   focus but it s never at the expense of being able to react quickly as things change  which they inevitably do    We use our own product  Receptive  to automate the creation of the various roadmaps we use  As requirements change status  the roadmaps are automatically updated so we never have to worry about documentation becoming out of date  Very handy   saves a lot of manual work    2   You will probably need more than one  Think about your audience   share an appropriate roadmap   https   giphy com  Always think about your audience when presenting a roadmap  Different stakeholders will be interested in different aspects of your plan so account for that so you don t waste anyone s time   We have the following   A high level roadmap we share with customers  It includes features in development   what we have planned  This keeps our user base informed of how we are building the product out in the longer term  but also shows what they can expect to be delivered relatively soon   Receptive s high level roadmap  Theme based roadmap for leadership  Know what is expected when you are reporting roadmap to the leadership team  Ours is simple  high level and shows broad themes of work we will deliver in the coming quarters   Theme based roadmap for leadership   sales team  Sales team also use both roadmaps  This cuts down on lots of  Where is this up   conversations with the product team and helps them get prospects excited about where we are heading   Feature based roadmap for development teams  At a lower level  we automatically feed features that have been set to a status  Developing  into the development team through a JIRA integration  https   www youtube com watch v WiOo97CQQfc  When the development team complete a Task  it automatically releases the feature in Receptive  notifies customers  prospects   team members who were following the feature and updates the Release Log    3   Hard delivery dates are EVIL  run away    Never put hard deadlines in a roadmap   https   giphy com  We have never found that sharing hard delivery dates is a positive experience for either the software vendor or customer  It sets expectations that are near impossible to keep   There are just too many factors that can change how long an improvement or new piece of functionality takes to develop  That s why we choose to show  Features in Development  and  Features that are Planned   It s more than enough transparency to keep customers confident we have a plan and strategy behind our product    4   It s all about the strategy  Every feature decision should be reference against strategy   https   giphy com  When you are creating your product roadmap  always start with the strategy  Usually this will involve input from several people so make sure you know who you should talk to   There are a load of different ways to create a strong product strategy  Themes of work could be directly linked to company KPIs  part of a plan to crack open a new market or a direct reaction to feedback you ve received from customers  just make sure you have a strategy in place otherwise you can end up building features that don t really add anything to the company    5   Good data is the difference between a sh t roadmap   a great one  Terrible data leads to poor product decisions   https   giphy com  Developing a product strategy and the schemes of development work which deliver it  rely on good data being fed into the decision making process   We have 3 main inputs   demand from the customer base  our internal teams and the market   We collect prioritized requirements over time so we are confident the information we are working with is up to date and relevant   Prioritized requirements from customers  internal teams and the market are our inputs  At the other side of the process  we segment all the information we receive  For example  we ll look at top requests from the market  what customer facing teams need to reduce churn and facilitate upsell and what matters to a biggest customers vs our small  We ll also look at feedback from free triallers  prospects and churned accounts separately  Those are just a few examples   Examples of how we segment our product demand   https   giphy com  Segmenting prioritized data means we don t fall into the trap of being pulled around by our most vocal customers  a team member with a particularly strong opinion or a sales team member who needs  just one more feature  to close a deal   Bringing real  actionable demand insights to our product meetings makes them efficient  productive and actually a whole heap of fun  We are always surprised by what we find in the data  Without it  product meetings would quickly decent into a sea of post it notes and opinion   Having Product Demand Intelligence allows us not only to make data driven product decisions  but to practice truly demand driven product

22,training-dataset/product/761.txt,product,How do you launch a product management career Advice for Early Career PMs How do you launch a product management career    Nothing early in your career is more important than achieving success   and nothing signals success more than working for a successful company     Andy Rachleff  It s June  and freshly minted graduates are just beginning their careers in product management  In many ways  I consider them fortunate when I was in college  product manager  meant something quite different  and it certainly wasn t on my shortlist of career choices  This New York Times article from 1989 shortly after I arrived in Boston as a freshman explains   Tracy Carlson has an inordinate interest in stains  Welcome to the world of product managers  the men and women who shepherd consumer products onto the shelves of the nation s retailers  Ms  Carlson is senior product manager for Lever Brothers  Wisk  which vies with Procter   Gamble s Tide to be the country s best selling liquid laundry detergent   I was not interested in stains  much less inordinately  My foray into product management was more stumble than strategy  and would take several more years   But I was lucky to start my career at high growth companies  where I was able to add successful brands to my r sum  and begin building a far reaching network that serves me to this day  I m talking about companies that have already found impressive traction  but are still early enough that there s lots of upside ahead  You will learn how to build things at scale and you will have more experienced product managers to learn from and be mentored by  There is plenty of room for you to shape the product and to take on more responsibility as the company grows  Since there hasn t been an exit yet  you ll get to work closely with the founders and there s a much better chance that your stock options will actually be worth something   So rather than jumping straight into your classmate s new YC company or taking that high falutin  title at a bootstrapped startup  look for a role at an established  high growth company  Think AirBnB  Github  Slack   Snapchat  Stripe  or Uber   As the years go by you ll get a disproportionate amount of credit for having been with a winner fairly or unfairly  Your experience will be sought after and the people you worked with will go on to start and invest in even more remarkable companies  You ll always have time to start your own company or join an early stage startup  and having the experience and network from a successful brand will only be an advantage when and if you eventually go that route   Others have made this case more eloquently  most prominently former VC and Wealthfront chairman Andy Rachleff  start here and here   Each year Andy publishes his list of career launching companies  here s the list for 2016  pdf    I find Andy s criteria to be a bit too narrow  so don t restrict yourself    Here are some other perspectives  from Josh Elman   One of the best things I think you can do early in your career   if you get the privilege to do so   is join a company you think is winning  I mean absolutely crushing it  At the peak of its game  Delivering products to users and customers that they love  and that you love  and that you can t wait to see what they do next   And Hunter Walk   These folks   plus your new peers   will most likely spend the next 20 years as your friends  managers  employees  VCs  cofounders  etc  Building a tight and high quality network early in your career is much more valuable than any fancy title or nearterm compensation  From folks a few years more experienced you ll get mentorship and learn good habits   What about big public companies  The most innovative ones Amazon  Apple  Google  or Facebook can be an excellent choice as well  but with some caveats that are worth noting  In a future newsletter I ll talk about that  and in particular PM specific launchpads such as Google s APM and Facebook s RPM programs   Good Reads  Disruption is not a strategy  argues Jerry Neumann  Despite its popularity  The Innovator s Dilemma wasn t written as a howto manual for startups  it was meant as a warning to incumbents   Google  despite the radical changes it brought to so many markets  set out to create something  not destroy anything  Disruption isn t everything     If you can t afford crazy  you can t afford brilliant   Astro Teller  captain of X  Alphabet s moonshot factory  recently gave a talk on failure  innovation  and engineering culture   UX design and choreography  Rebecca Ussai applies Disney s animation principles to UX design   The biggest thing to take away here is that our job as UX and visual designers is not just to make things functional and follow best practices  We re also trying to make these experiences enjoyable and  most of all  tell a story through experience sequences    Product Jobs  Subscribe to the newsletter to see these job listings

24,training-dataset/product/924.txt,product,Where do product managers come from I m a product manager by chance   I didn t dream of becoming a product manager as a kid  I never got a university degree in product management  or any other for that matter   It just somehow happened   I m a copywriter and startup co founder  turned product manager   Nowadays  while trying to hire product managers for my team  I started wondering where do product managers come from   So I did what product managers do  I looked for data to play with   Using Linkedin  I gathered 1 000 random profiles of product managers in the United States and analyzed their education and job experience   Cool insights below   Bottom Lines First    Less than half of product managers have a technical education     The most popular degrees product managers acquire are Computer Science and different kinds of Engineering     Only 11  of Product Managers started their careers in product management     Product Managers are big fans of MBAs     Google   Facebook are big fans of technical Product Managers     Looking to hire a product manager  Try stealing one from R D     Looking for your first product management job  Might be easier to try in a really big company so they won t notice you know nothing   Bias alert   I analyzed my own Linkedin network  I m a web product manager living in Israel  so my dataset probably leans towards that as well  Even though there are product managers in nearly every commercial industry  here I focus on my own world   Product What   Before we ll analyze the results  let s quickly align on the definition of Product Management   A product manager is a unique creature in the startup and technology world  We are involved in almost every piece of the business  but not necessarily experts in anything in particular   We set timelines  plans  and expectations  but not necessarily manage the people who work according to those plans   According to Wikipedia  product management is the following     the  organizational lifecycle function within a company dealing with the planning  forecasting  and production  or marketing of a product or products at all stages of the product lifecycle    https   en wikipedia org wiki Product_management   It s not wrong  but if we re looking for a definition that s both in English and with a chance to be remembered  there are 2 other options I like   One is Josh Elman s definition of the product manager s job    Help your team  and company  ship the right product to your users   And the second is how Martin Erikson explains it    The intersection between business  technology and user experience   So after establishing the definition of a product manager  what makes someone qualify to be one  Do they need to be proficient in all three disciplines we mentioned  Do they need to be a natural born leader and strategist  How can I know who to hire and more importantly  How can someone become a product manager   The Dataset  I took 1 000 product managers from the US  who work for hundreds of different companies  trying to represent the US tech scene  Here are the top appearing companies in the dataset   Google  8   Facebook  4   Linkedin  3   Cisco  3   Amazon  2   Uber  2   eBay  2   Adobe  1   Education  The first factor I looked at for discovering the road to becoming a product manager was their academic education   As someone who managed to make it through 1 4 semesters before dropping out to do his own thing  I was hoping to find more like me  I didn t   Given there isn t a degree in  Product Management   but only a few classes  I found that the possible academic backgrounds of product managers are quite diverse  even though engineering rules them all    Out of the entire dataset of Product Managers  only 2  did not have any form of higher education  that number might even be lower as not everyone bothers to spit shine their Linkedin profile    On average  every product manager is the proud owner of 1 8 degrees  and the median number is 2   45  of product managers are technical by education  studied Computer Science or some form of Engineering    The breakdown of degrees is the following   28  studied some form of Engineering  20  studied Computer Science  17  studied Marketing  10  studied Economics  4  studied Mathematics  2  studied Design  Really   Only 2   Who knew   So the good news is there are many ways to become a Product Manager  You can have both a technical and a non technical background and still get to the promised position  The bad news is you better get yourself ready to do some serious studying first because companies like their product managers educated   Product Management classes  I ve also seen that quite a few PMs went to various product management classes   According to Joel Foster  a PM himself  General Assembly  they see three kinds of students enrolling     Management consultants looking for a change    Entrepreneurs looking for a new skill set    People who find themselves in product  looking for formal training  Regarding the students  conversion rate to becoming PMs  Joel says    We ve seen that the position they land after graduation is heavily dependent on their prior work experiences  Alumni who held more senior or relevant jobs such as management consultants  senior engineers or UX designers frequently land jobs as PMs  while alumni with less relevant experience found jobs as associate product managers  business analysts  or entry level associate consultants    The more you can learn about actual product management  the better  but having actual work experience can t hurt   MBA  meet PM   Almost 1 in every 4 product managers holds an MBA   These product managers come from different academic and occupational backgrounds  but it seems an MBA can be a great  fast forward  button to becoming a PM   After all  we did say a product manager is supposed to have a good understanding of various disciplines  and what s more various than an MBA   The all in one of academia and the all in one of tech go pretty well hand in hand   Job Experience  The second factor I looked into was the product managers  occupational backgrounds   One of the tricky parts about becoming a product manager is that most workplaces require experience  but experience is hard to come by   That might be one of the reasons why the grand majority of PMs start their careers in other fields  We might also just be late bloomers   Only 11  started with product management as their first job   Many started in other departments and only then shifted towards product management  Even though the most common route to Product is from R D  there are quite a few other options   Here are the most common first jobs among current product managers   25  Developers  11  Product managers  8  Analysts  6  Marketing managers  3  Founded their own companies  3  Researchers  2  Customer support  2  Salespeople  2  Consultants  1  Project managers  Much like with what product managers study  the biggest group here has a technical background  but it s far from being the majority   All roads  can  lead to Product   Company sizes   Another assumption I had  was that a small company would be more willing  or desperate  to accept a product manager with no experience  given a smaller recruiting pipeline and potentially a lower pay   Looking at the list of companies where product managers got their first jobs  it s hardly the case  with names such as Microsoft  PayPal  Google Yahoo and others   Big companies with over 10 000 employees seem to be more likely to accept a rookie product manager  perhaps because there are enough veterans to help with training   Here s the breakdown of companies who accepted product managers with no experience  based on number of employees   The Google   Facebook Showdown  Another thing I looked into is whether there s a difference between product managers in Google and in Facebook  in terms of academic background   The below numbers are based on a sample size of 113 product managers from Google and 55 product managers from Facebook   Looking at these numbers  it seems there aren t big differences between product managers in Google and in Facebook   With that said  there are quite significant differences between the two companies and the general average  Product managers in both Google   Facebook are much more technical than average   So Where Do They Come From   It seems the classic product manager got a degree in engineering and worked as a developer for a couple of years before seeing the light of product management   With that said  as a proud outlier to statistics  I can testify  and now also show some numbers  that there are numerous ways to get into product management   Whether you studied one semester in film school or got a degree in nutritional science  if for some reason you decided product management is your thing  there is a way   We re always looking for good people,"[24 1092 356 302 192 507 98 1365 802 1099 605]"
41,training-dataset/product/1147.txt,product,The Stigma of a Perfect Product77 Flares 77 Flares    Has anyone ever really created the perfect piece of software  I d venture that the answer is a resounding  No    Every product has its flaws  whether in user experience  feature set  bugs  or technical debt  And I think we all know and accept that  Most product leaders are realists  Perfect to a product manager usually means done right  not flawless  In our iterative  agile world  it s naive to think that we ever ship anything faultless or absolute  The product is never finished   So why then is perfection such a hot topic in product development  Countless articles debate quality versus speed  and tote bags and t shirts don platitudes like  done is better than perfect  and  perfect is the enemy of good    In my experience when people talk about perfection  they often use it as a mask to obscure a point they re uncomfortable making directly  And that s a problem  because it means actual issues are liable to be swept under the rug  As product managers  the real enemy is anything that gets in the way of efficient communication or holds you back from creating the most valuable product for your users   For example  rather than expressing concern as   Are the requirements for this feature overly complex   you might hear marketing assert   It doesn t have to be perfect  just release it as an MVP   Or when you ve gone through draft after draft of a design because your intuition tells you something is off  instead of reminding you of an upcoming deadline  the project manager exclaims   It looks fine  stop being such a perfectionist    Perfect  or good enough   Does anyone really believe that perfection is the goal here  Or are they trying to make you fear being seen as slow to promote their own agenda  Though perhaps not maliciously intended  the use of black and white thinking creates a false dichotomy  either it s perfect  or it s good enough  In this logic stalemate  you might feel pressure to prove you can ship  and in doing so  stop what you re working on  But your compromise may leave greatness or excellence on the cutting room floor  or worse  lead you to release a below grade solution that s not viable  or is just plain terrible   The next time you hear someone else use perfect  dig deeper  Ask questions until you discover what they re really after  You might find that you get to the heart of the problem faster and improve communication,"[41 1116 423 165 692 990 356 1365 98 426 776]"

YouTube  he increased traffic by 40x while growing his product team from three to more than 30  Today Hunter is instilling the lessons learned with promising young founders through his seed stage venture capital firm  Homebrew  He s a must follow for entrepreneurs on Twitter  and he regularly shares startup advice at hunterwalk com  I caught up with Hunter to get his take on what it takes to excel in product management  why growing companies must prioritize bigger bets over easy  low effort improvements  how he identifies his seed investments  and more  If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes  Google Play  SoundCloud  or grab the RSS feed  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the episode  Short on time  Here are five quick takeaways  Exceptional product managers share four common skills  curiosity  communication  service leadership  and empathy  When product management and customer support don t have a bi directional line of communication  the product suffers  If leadership isn t helping your organization understand why a big  transformative bet is important  and working on one of those  your company s growth curve is likely flattening  For founders to garner a seed stage investment from Homebrew  Hunter needs to see a product solving a problem that is large  urgent  and valuable  The best founders are intentional about culture  hiring practices  fundraising velocity  org structure  etc  because they re building a company they want to work at for a very long time  Adam Risman  Hunter  welcome to the show  Can you give us a feel for your career trajectory and what drew you from working on products specifically into the world of venture capital  Hunter Walk  We re about three and a half years into Homebrew  Before that I spent a lot of my time on the product side  it was actually the place where I found that left brain and right brain worked together  I spent three years at Second Life and then nine years at Google  divided between AdSense and YouTube  The connective tissue between Second Life  AdSense and YouTube was technology as a tool of creation within a community and audience  and then importantly  with an economic model that would allow creators to see dollars from their creations  not just likes and hearts  Adam  During your run at YouTube you were the director of product management and over that time  you grew traffic by 40x  What were the biggest challenges you faced in that time  Hunter  I came over from Google right after the acquisition and although it s funny to think about now  the acquisition wasn t necessarily embraced by the tech community  Everyone thought Google overpaid  this was a site that was just about dogs riding skateboards  how was it ever going to make money  was it legal  was it just a fad  It was about 65 people  Google let us operate separately  still headquartered in San Bruno  so we weren t even on the main Google campus  From a product standpoint  I was lucky enough to inherit something that was burning hot  but how could we turn phosphorous into a furnace  How could we make sure that it burned forever  There were three main things that I set out to accomplish during my time at YouTube  The first was taking it from phenomena to ongoing consumer product  Can we make sure that it grows with our users and grows across platforms  Second  could it make any money  Eventually you have to figure out how to not just pay Google but  more importantly  pay the creators who are putting video on the site  Then there were some lawsuits at the time  There were people who were attempting to say that YouTube was benefiting improperly from copyrighted works  We always wanted to work very closely with rights owners  so started very early on we asked  how do we build the tools to make fan uploads productive as opposed to destructive  How to excel in product management Adam  While juggling all these product concerns  you also grew the product team from just three to more than 30  A lot of our listeners are from small  early stage companies and they re just now starting to look to hire and grow their product teams  What traits do you often see for those that are going to excel in product management  Being consensus driven is death from a product management standpoint  Hunter  Regardless of the nature of product management and the nature of the product  you need four qualities  One is curiosity  You have to always be asking questions and always wanting to learn  You have to be a good communicator  you re going to be talking not just to engineers and designers but cross functionally across the entire company  You re often an external facing champion of your product as well  Third  you need to be working in service of something greater than you  Product management is about service leadership  It s about realizing that you re there for a period of time to take a product from one stage to another  People sometimes say   You re the CEO of the product   I think that s fine  so long as you realize that what you re doing is trying to make something stronger  to then potentially hand off to the next set of leaders to take it beyond your time  Then you also need to have empathy and customer focus  You have to be able to put yourself in the shoes of others and understand their points of view  That doesn t mean you have to be consensus driven  in fact  I think being consensus driven is death from a product management standpoint  but you do have to understand other points of view  even if you don t always agree or act upon them  Adam  You re getting feature requests from all sorts of different avenues too  You need the backbone to really be able to say no to most of those  right  Hunter  Absolutely  People need to feel like they have the opportunity to comment  to criticize  to provide their suggestions  but at the end of the day  whether it s you  one of the product managers in your group or somebody else within the company  you need to have clear decision makers  When the comment period is done  you have to trust those people to make the right decisions  Adam  You re a product manager from a non technical background  For PMs that have had a similar path  how should they go about prioritizing or seeking guidance when it comes to things like infrastructure work or engineering challenges  You obviously don t want to fake knowledge that isn t there  Hunter  There were plenty of times in my career where I felt like an impostor  especially at Google  To the right and to the left of you is a product manager with a technical background and they keep talking about how those are the product managers they want to hire  However  I noticed that most of the product VPs didn t have technical backgrounds  I had plenty of role models within the company that could prove you didn t need a technical background  despite the fact that I was being told that every 23 year old with a human computer interaction degree from Stanford was a better PM than I was going to be  There are certain types of projects that require certain backgrounds  If you re a PM who lacks deep technical knowledge  there s some infrastructure stuff that probably doesn t make sense  I would say almost everything else does  You need to be technically curious and technically confident if not necessarily technically trained  It means developing great rapport with your engineering counterparts  it means trust  it means understanding what questions to ask to get the data you need or to help people think through making the right decision  Product management is about service leadership  I worked for Susan Wojcicki   Google was famously founded in her garage and now she s the CEO of YouTube  When she brought me into her product org  I leaned over and I was like   I m nervous  I don t have a CS degree   and she said   Hunter  we have lots of really great engineers  If you had to make technical decisions  Google would be in a lot of trouble  It would mean that we were hiring bad engineers   and that gave me a framework to think about this  My job was to help our really great engineers and our really great engineering leaders aim their talents in the right direction  I relied upon my ability to help create that direction  my ability to make sure that direction stayed on track and my ability to help those people feel great and proud about the work they were doing  I don t think any of that requires a technical degree  I m not clear that any of that even requires a college degree  although I ll push for the liberal arts since I was a history major  Adam  One of the big collaborative points for us with product is customer support  We re actually embedding customer support team members with the product team to make sure the customer s voice is heard  How did your product team  whether it was at YouTube or Second Life  work across disciplines and how crucial was that to your success  Hunter  Incredibly important at every company I ve been at  At YouTube  you had a very large and very vocal community  and there were things they often needed help with  Sometimes that was purely technical help  sometimes that was enforcing community standards  Very often it was as we rolled out new types of features or rolled out to new countries  It was also an education for us  The only way that we re able to let information flow from the company to our users and from our users back to our company  was thinking about support as a bi directional channel and not just as an FAQ or a call center     If product and support teams are siloed  you won t build what your customers need  We embraced having a product manager who worked closely with that team  figuring out what KPIs we wanted to measure for support  that weren t just about triage and dismissing  but were more about  do we have a high NPS in our interactions with our users  Are we gaining information and insights from our support channel just like we would from user research or market research  We looked at all of those interactions as opportunities to learn rather than potential issues to just smother  Adam  Despite all of the success that you had scaling the product and your product management team  you ve said you weren t necessarily the best product leader  On paper it looks like you were outstanding  Is a result of the politics involved with management and being a step removed from the creative decision making  Hunter  I m very proud of the accomplishments that occurred while I was there and credit an amazing cross functional team that I had the chance to work with  I do think that there were two distinct periods in YouTube s development that I had the chance to play a role in  In the first half  I would give myself very high marks  it was growing the initial team  it was working under the guidance of Chad Hurley  the CEO and one of the founders  and it was YouTube truly as a separate entity  That was when we did a deal with Apple to get YouTube as the only third party app on the initial iPhone  We papered agreements with Twitter and Facebook  we were really externally focused and meeting our users where they were and thinking about how to move quickly  be innovative and take risks  We reached a point in size where  all of a sudden  we became strategically important to Google  We had a change in leadership  we had a great leader from Google come over as Chad moved into more of an emeritus role  and a lot of the discussion at that point became about where YouTube fit into the Google portfolio  We reached a scale in headcount where  as a product leader  I felt like my job needed to switch towards people management and clearing roadblocks for them opposed to being on a whiteboard or helping them think through product design decisions  Those were the areas where I found myself to be less satisfied and maybe not living up to the expectations that I had set for myself  Some of that you can call politics  but I don t want to be pejorative  Those are important skills for product management leaders to have and my successor was great at all of those things and exactly the right leader for pulling YouTube into that next phase and continuing to increase YouTube s reach and profit and everything by another order of magnitude  I went in strong  I m proud of what we accomplished  but I also realized towards the end that it was possible to get pulled into a role that didn t necessarily suit me  That s where it comes back to that service mentality  Am I working in service of myself  or am I working in service of the product  the company and the team  If it s the latter  which is what it should be  then you start to realize that you re not exactly what they need at that time  It took me a little while to realize that  but in retrospect  stepping away and leaving was the right decision  The long term importance of prioritization Adam  At any technology company one of the biggest challenges is prioritization  Recently you had a chat with our senior director of growth  Ben McRedmond  about prioritizing work in a way that creates impactful change  You ve got a chart with effort across the X axis and impact spread across the Y axis   Most everyone is pretty good about avoiding the high effort  low impact work  When it comes to high impact  low effort work  there s really not much there once you re a mature company  Then you ve got the low effort  low impact work and you ve called that snacking  To me that s copycat features  that low hanging fruit  maybe changing a button color or small language tweaks and UI  etc  Why do startups feel pulled towards this and what s the risk there  Hunter  As an individual atomic unit  any one of those changes is valuable  right  It s not that the reward isn t there  They each have a positive benefit  but they re all small  local optimizations  They all avoid the big bet you should be making  the more complex question you should be asking yourself  such as are we growing more relevant or less relevant as a product for our users  Is the world around us changing and do we need to be aggressive in changing with it or leading our users to a new reality  A little snack here and there never hurt anybody  but trying to do nothing but eat potato chips all day will eventually leave you dead  Companies of all sizes fall into these for a variety of reasons  Each of the reasons has a different core problem behind it  One is if you have a reward and recognition system that celebrates volume  number of features shipped  if productivity seems to equal rate of code check ins or things like that  then you slowly drift towards   What are all the things that we can get done   If you have an organization that doesn t want to take risks or where failure to deliver results   even though it was a smart  calculated bet   is punished right away as opposed to examined and improved  then if given the choice between something that you know is going to have a minor improvement and something that is going to take a longer time to prove  the gravitational pull will be towards those small things  In fact  a lot of wonderful software tools  the multivariate testing frameworks  are often geared towards finding the beautiful snacks  The one that is most insidious and sometimes the hardest to fix is when you have lots of talented people who are doing nothing but snacking  nothing but items three through twenty on their to do list as opposed to items one and two  It can be an indication of dysfunction as opposed to highly functional  and that s to say there is a decision that s not being made  there are groups that don t want to collaborate  there are people who just get frustrated   the designer or the engineer who doesn t want to sit at another meeting to debate the outcome of a big effort  As a leader  if you re not helping your organization understand why a big  transformative bet is important and always working on one of those  preparing to work on one of those or coming out of working on one of those  then your growth curve is likely flattening in some way  You re losing the chance to pull ahead of the competition  to pull your users into the future  The graph may not show it yet but you wake up each day and you haven t made progress towards reinventing yourself  Adam  Is part of that the lure of chasing the competition rather than trying to make that high strategy big bet  Hunter  It can be  If you miss a platform shift  it can be very hard to catch up  As a leader  trying to make the decision of whether we should catch up or whether we should try to leap frog is a really tough one  If you go into any company and ask do you think we re becoming more relevant or less relevant to our users every day  you ll get some really interesting answers  You can also tell when people are trying to change the KPIs on you  Changing the KPIs can be one of the most effective ways to actually make a phase change to burn the ships  but you can also tell if you ask what the motivation was  It s the classic MySpace example   I remember when MySpace shifted from focus on its US user base to global user base  It was because growth was stopping in the US and you had all these other countries where growth was going wonderful  so you want to find the next chart that shows you re up and to the right  What they should ve been asking was   Oh no  what s going on here in the US   Why is this flat lining  Is that indicative of what s going to happen in other markets once we meet maturity or once Facebook rolls out in those geographies  One of the most brilliant things my successor at YouTube  Shashir Morocho  did was  look at the  lethargy setting in and around view counts  It was no longer the best way to understand user engagement  and there was a big party when we hit one billion view counts  It became trying to get people excited about hitting two billion  three billion  four billion  It was numbing  There was no galvanizing  user facing stat  He led this organization wide change to move from view count to amount of video viewed per day  It all of a sudden became about longer sessions  How do we get from 15 minutes a day to 30 minutes or 60 minutes a day  That required a leap of faith and rethinking our analytical frameworks  but ultimately it reframed what a happy  successful user looked like in a way that ensured that the YouTube of mobile  the YouTube of the living room  and the YouTube of today is YouTube and not a successive property  If I had stayed on  I don t know if I would ve been able to make that change I had grown up in this view count environment  I inherited the product when it was at 100 million views and I d taken it to four  four and a half billion  I wanted to get to 10 billion  but that wasn t the right metric for that product anymore  The shift to seed Adam  You re now at Homebrew  your VC firm that s focused on the seed stage   essentially a startup funding startups  What was it about that stage specifically that you were excited about or in favor of rather than something more advanced like a series A  Is it the ability to roll up your sleeves and be able to collaborate with founders  harkening back to your product days  Hunter  Hombrew began because my co founder  Satya Patel  and I wanted to work together again  We d spent a few years working at Google and his background is a mix of product leadership roles and venture  He had led product at Twitter prior to us starting Homebrew  Venture  and specifically seed stage  wasn t where we started  We didn t start with an idea of what we would do together  We talked about what would it mean to work together again and used that to narrow down what we would enjoy doing together and where we could add something to the community  We were really focused on how do we want to spend our days  what sort of a relationship do we want to have with founders and how do we want to make our money  What does success look like  We asked ourselves those questions as opposed to   How much can we raise  Okay  that ll be the fund we are   or  What s the most near term  economically advantaged strategy for us to take   which is certainly not being a seed fund  It came down to  do we want to create value for ourselves on the term sheets  do we want to be thinking about an 80 page document with all these different conditions for what could or might happen  do we want to make our money with an Excel model  plugging in data and trying to figure out if this company s going to IPO in a year or not  The answer to all those things is  of course  no  We want to be good at identifying founders who have a strong vision for what the future should look like  a future that we believe in  a future that is solving a problem that s large  urgent and valuable  Then  somebody who can put sweat and reputation behind every day  You make an investment decision  then you still have to get up with that team every day,"[46 1116 426 776 802 381 24 1131 338 692 1365]"

56,training-dataset/product/1232.txt,product,Five Essential Steps for Getting into IoT Product Management39 Flares 39 Flares    You want to get into IoT product management  but where do you start  What skills do you need  Which companies are working on IoT today  Start with these five essential steps   According to analyst firm Gartner  there will be over 20 billion connected devices by 2020  This trend is fuelled by companies around the world embracing the IoT trend and launching more and more products that are connected to the internet  I ll be the first to admit that the IoT industry is very young  and there are many products out there that don t seem to add a lot of value  These products are often hyped in the news and are the center of attention in consumer shows  so I m not surprised that so many people are skeptical about IoT   But the reality is that the products that get all the attention are just the tip of the iceberg  There are many companies launching incredible applications with IoT  We are already seeing great innovations with smart cars  intelligent manufacturing  and improvements to critical infrastructure such as energy and water systems   To succeed in this new technological era  companies from small startups to huge enterprises are realizing they need a solid IoT product strategy and they need product managers to help in this area  In fact  as I write this post  LinkedIn has close to 2 000 job openings for IoT product related roles just in the United States  so it s no surprise that the most frequent question I m asked by fellow product managers is   How do I transition into IoT Product Management     Below  I outline what it means to be an IoT PM and the steps you can take to start your journey into this career path   1  Make Sure Your Basic Product Management Skills are Solid  IoT Product Management is still Product Management   There are  however  some key aspects that make managing an IoT product very complex  But before we look at these aspects  I should emphasize that regardless of the product  technology  or industry you work in  the role of the product manager is always the same  build products that add value to your customers and to your company   If you already have experience managing a tech product  then you re ahead of the curve  All your experience is directly applicable to IoT  The experience of understanding and validating users  needs  creating a business case  defining and prioritizing requirements  building roadmaps  working with engineering  managing up and more   these are all skills you can put to work immediately in IoT   If you don t have product management experience  then I recommend you start by working on a non IoT product before jumping into the complex world of IoT  A few releases of either hardware or software products under your belt will make it much easier for you to attract the attention of IoT companies   2  Understand the Full IoT Technology Stack  and be an Expert in at Least one Layer  Although we call them IoT  products   in reality as an IoT product manager you are building a system  That s because there are five layers in the IoT technology stack  These layers are   Device hardware  Device software  Communications  Cloud platform  Cloud applications  If this concept is new to you  take a look at my IoT Primer for Product Managers   IoT products have much more complexity than  say  a Cloud product  which only has the two Cloud layers listed above  And each of these five layers could be considered a product in its own right  So managing an IoT product is like managing a portfolio of five products   When you switch to IoT Product Management  you have the challenge of understanding the relationship and interdependencies of all five layers   The good news is that most hiring managers understand that it s very unlikely to have a single person to manage an end to end IoT solution  So unless you are in a very small startup  the chances are you ll be working with other product managers who specialize in the different layers of the IoT stack   This is where the concept of a  T shaped  Product Manager comes into play  An IoT Product Manager needs to have a solid horizontal understanding of all five layers of the IoT technology stack and how the end to end system works  You should then complement this with deep vertical understanding in one of the layers of the IoT technology stack   For example  if you have experience managing a mobile app  then you are already familiar with Cloud platforms and Cloud applications  To get into IoT  you should focus on learning  at a higher level  how the other three layers of the IoT technology stack work  device hardware  device software  and communications  and how all the layers relate to each other  That way  you ll be an expert in two layers and be skilled enough to have intelligent conversations with other teams about the complete system   Similarly  if you have hardware experience  then you re already familiar with the device hardware layer  But to get into IoT  you need to understand how the other four layers work  at least well enough to be able to participate in strategic discussions about the end to end product and to coordinate with the Product Managers for the other layers   3  Understand What Types of Companies you Could Work for  If you are new to IoT  it can be very daunting to understand which companies are doing what  A good first step is to understand the types of companies working in IoT so you can get an idea of the potential opportunities they might have and where your skill set could be a match   This diagram shows the three types of companies I ve identified   Product Companies  As the name implies  product companies are building IoT products to sell to other companies or to consumers  Companies that build end to end products are the ones that get the most press and buzz  These companies provide a finished product that includes the five layers of the IoT technology stack   But building an end to end product is not the only way to work in IoT  Since IoT systems are very complex  there are many companies that focus on building specific components of the IoT technology stack   For example  some companies focus only on the Cloud platform  others only on analytics  others only on hardware components  and so on  So if you are already an expert in one or two layers of the IoT technology stack  it might be easier to find opportunities if you go after companies that also specialize in that layer  Say you already have Cloud experience  then you ll have an edge when applying to a company providing IoT Cloud platforms as products   Services Companies  By services  I don t mean the  as a service  business model  which is big in IoT by the way   Rather  I m referring to companies that provide professional services to take customers through the last mile of their implementation  In fact  some of the biggest consulting companies like Accenture  Bain  Tata  and others have  or are building  IoT practices to meet the growing demand they see from their customers worldwide   Services companies have a wide range of services that span the whole lifecycle of IoT products including strategy consulting  development outsourcing  deployment  field services  and asset management  to name a few   Many professional services companies build internal tools or products to accelerate the timeline of the services they provide  These internal tools need Product Managers  so there s room for us in services companies   Companies Implementing IoT for Internal use  The third group is companies looking at IoT as a new way to solve existing internal problems  Their goal is not to release an IoT product commercially  but to connect existing equipment to the internet so they can optimize their processes and get better visibility into their performance   Think of an industrial company looking for new ways to optimize its manufacturing plant to improve its yields   by connecting its manufacturing equipment to the internet  which turns them into so called smart devices   it can act on new data that leads to process and automation optimization   The takeaway here is that these companies are building products  They are internal products  but products nonetheless  Despite all the hype around smart homes and wearables  industrial applications for process optimization is the biggest area where IoT is making a difference today  and it can be a great opportunity for a PM to get started in IoT   The three types of companies are depicted in a Venn diagram above because there s a lot of overlap between the three types  In the IoT world  many product companies offer services  Many professional services companies build internal products  And some industrial companies develop products for internal use and to then sell to others   These blurred boundaries add complexity  but also provide a great opportunity for us Product Managers to expand our horizons and understand the big picture of how complex product ecosystems work   4  Focus on a Specific Industry  IoT is an umbrella term that encompasses everything from smart toasters to self driving cars to smartwatches and everything in between  Given this lack of clarity  it s easy to see why people are confused about how to start pursuing an IoT product manager role   I recommend that you focus on an industry in which you can leverage your existing domain knowledge  This will make you more attractive to companies and will make it easier for you to start conversations with them  For reference  some of the industries in which IoT is having the biggest impact include  in no particular order    Smart homes  Smart cities  Smart buildings  Healthcare  Wearables  Transportation  Energy  Manufacturing  Retail  Drones  Agriculture  5  Learn From People Already Working in IoT  The best way to learn  especially about a new topic or industry  is to learn from people already doing that work  Identify companies you are interested in and reach out to the IoT Product Managers there via LinkedIn  Attend meetups and trade shows  Find publications  blogs  magazines  podcasts  etc   that you like  and read everything they produce  In short  find a way to educate yourself by learning from others   The Bottom Line  IoT is projected to have tremendous growth in the coming years  And working as an IoT product manager is a great opportunity to grow your skills and be a part of one of the most innovative areas of technology today   By focusing on the recommendations above  you ll have a much better understanding of what skills are needed and a better chance of breaking into IoT Product Management  Good luck,"[56 763 605 990 24 356 381 142 530 302 1092]"
66,training-dataset/product/1398.txt,product,Six Effective Process Hacks from Top Product LeadersEach month at General Catalyst  we host functional leaders from high growth startups across New York for a discussion on a relevant industry theme or challenge   Our most recent working session  led by former CTO   Digital Product Lead of Birchbox Liz Crawford  centered around structuring product teams and best practices for product management  When Crawford first joined Birchbox  the startup had just 15 employees and thousands of subscribers  During her five years as CTO  Crawford helped scale to a 300 person company with offices in four countries and a million monthly subscribers   Crawford s perspective was complemented by Chief Product Officers from Classpass  BarkBox  Oscar Health  Abacus  Squarespace  and more  Hailing from startups ranging from a few to a few hundred employees  from seed to growth stage  and representing both enterprise and consumer businesses  these CPOs shared shortcuts with wide applicability   1  Institute planning processes across the organization  When starting a new project  dedicate time to outline milestones and stakeholders  and align the team around clearly articulated goals  By frontloading this work  you can anticipate issues that may arise and address them ahead of time   Here are some of the best practices the group uses in product planning   Maintain a problem driven rather than solution driven approach to development  Build a  hypothesis roadmap  ahead of each project   Keeping a broader team aligned around the problem at hand prevents folks from getting wedded to a single approach for solving it and allows for more autonomy   Sarah Schwarzbeck   Senior Director of Product at Plated  says   Senior Director of Product at Plated  says  1stdibs has adopted Amazon s famous  press release  approach to product development planning  which involves having developers draft a hypothetical press release or news article covering the product  before writing even a line of code  This backwards approach ensures products are customer driven rather than PM driven and encourages developers to articulate the product s broader impact  Xiaodi Zhang  Chief Product Officer at 1stdibs says    Define a project s metrics for success in advance  That way  you know when to kill it   Idan Cohen  CEO   Co founder of Grow  says   One of the worst things that can happen to an organization is if you get too committed to something that isn t working    2  Build institutional memory  Documenting and sharing best practices across the organization enables teams to learn from the past  better understand customer behavior and preferences  and avoid repeat mistakes   While the benefits of routine knowledge sharing may not be immediately realized  these lessons prove a vital resource when scaling from one product to two  onboarding new employees  or when opening a second office   Here are some of the procedural hacks the group uses for effective knowledge sharing   At Classpass  product managers send company wide updates following every major meeting  recapping key decisions made and highlighting relevant documents  These communications are then pasted into a Google Doc  so the entire process is documented   If you re new  you can just click on the  customer acquisition  section and see how we arrived at what we re doing today   Justin Chang  Head of Product Management at Classpass  says   At Flow  product managers share pre launch briefs with the entire company and follow up with true  transparent testing results  Whether you work as a back end engineer or at the front desk  this helps everyone in the company build a comprehensive understanding of their customer and the processes that work best  Andrew Chen  SVP Product Management at Flow  explained   Abacus runs Net Promoter Score  NPS  results through a company wide Slack channel  Posting these results sparks productive side conversations across teams   The good ones feel really good and the bad ones feel really productive   Co founder   Design Lead Ted Power says   3  Structure your team to own different points of customer experience  When building your product organization  consider aligning teams around different stages of the customer journey  Jeremiah Zinn  Chief Product Officer at BarkBox  divides product into two subteams  The first focuses on getting a customer to their site to subscribe  The second focuses on retaining customers for as long as possible  Zhang s team at 1stdibs separates product into user acquisition centric and conversion centric teams   Whatever the structure  be sure each team is oriented around relevant KPIs  Crawford emphasized  This way  it s clear which team drives and owns each metric of success   4  Team structure isn t one size fits all  As companies scale  products and goals scale too  The product team s structure should evolve to reflect these shifting goals   In the early days  product strategy is driven by urgency  As your business scales  thoughtful product strategy becomes really important  and a bigger part of your job   Crawford says   The hiring criteria for product managers often change as your company transitions through various stages  Crawford notes  In the early days  startups rely on managers with versatile skills that can support operations across the organization  As you enter the growth stage  teams become more specialized allowing for strategic hires   What defines  early  vs  growth  and how can you anticipate this transition   Jeremiah Zinn of BarkBox suggests an 80 person team is the breaking point where infrastructure becomes essential   At that point  you no longer have everyone sitting in one scrum asking  what s the most important thing to do next     Zinn says   When your customer base has scaled and you have a bigger organization suddenly you can and need to focus on more infrastructure oriented projects like billing  inventory or user authentication   The  DACI   Driver  Approver  Contributor  Informed  model to product management helped Classpass successfully navigate this transition  Chang  explained  This taskforce esque model includes creating groups comprised of at least one representative from each role involved in the project  This group meets regularly throughout the project and is involved in all major decisions from planning to launch  The DACI model increases accountability and ensures all relevant parties are informed throughout the process  Chang said   5  Don t underestimate the importance of internal PMs  As companies transition into the growth stage  developing the infrastructure to support high velocity product development is essential   Having an internal product or platform manager can prove really effective  especially for companies that leverage third party services  Zinn says  This is someone dedicated to building software product to make internal operational workflows more efficient   Managing internal PMs alongside external PMs requires thought  Crawford highlights  because their projects  goals  skills and concerns are often very different   6  Don t build anything   dramatic pause  yet   The best advice Zinn has ever received came from one of BarkBox s earliest advisors  a founder at Urban Outfitters  who said  making their first store perfect almost prevented us from openning a hundred more     The best opportunities are ahead of us   Zinn says   We risk missing them if we overbuild what we have now,"[688 66 692 1131 1116 121 802 98 1365

is ultimately responsible for the success of the business  even that similarity is a stretch  A product manager ultimately has a CEO behind them somewhere  and can always pass the buck  Now most product managers don t pass the buck  and this ownership of the problem and willingness to make the hard decisions is where a product manager gets closest to being a CEO but there is a massive difference between having someone behind you or really having the final say   Where the two roles differ completely is in authority  Product managers simply don t have any direct authority over most of the things needed to make their products successful   from user and data research through design and development to marketing  sales  and support  Even today s most senior product leaders only have hiring and firing control over their direct reports   other product managers  Does that sound like any CEO you know   A CEO  on the other hand  stands truly alone  with ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of not just the company but every product in it  The CEO also controls all the resources of the company   with hiring and firing prerogatives across the company and final say on the budget  Does that sound like any product manager you know   Not just Semantics  This may seem like mere semantics but the distinction is important  Too many product managers I meet buy into this trope of CEO of the product and believe their role is to act like an authoritarian CEO  often with disastrous results  These product managers tend to believe they have all the answers  that they produce the best solutions and designs  and that their teams should just do what they re told  They re mini CEOs after all   Lead  don t Command  Truly successful product leaders instead embrace their lack of authority and lead their teams and the wider company through communication  vision  and influence  They focus on collaborating across the company  bringing together the best people to move the product forward  and setting those teams free to execute on their product vision   In Daniel Pink s book To Sell is Human  he refers to this skill as the ability to  move  people from one mindset to another  Successful product managers and leaders spend a significant portion of their time engaged in these  moving  activities  bringing everyone together around a shared understanding of the customer problem so that everyone can be involved in helping solve it to further the business goals   Product management is a team sport after all  and the best teams don t have bosses   they have coaches who ensure all the skills and experiences needed are present on the team  that everyone is in the right place  knows where the goal is  and then gets out of the way and lets the team do what they do best in order to reach that goal   As Ken Norton  Product Partner at GV  says in my upcoming book Product Leadership  How Top Product Managers Launch Great Products and Build Successful Teams   When you re a product manager  you re generally not the boss  You need to gain authority through your actions and your leadership skills  not your role    Most of the product leaders we interviewed for the book echoed sentiments like this   A lot of people say the product manager is like the CEO or the captain of the ship  I don t really think of it that way because when you describe things like that it makes it seem as though you re making all the decisions  or you re driving how everything works together  and you re not   adds Mina Radhakrishnan  the first Head of Product at Uber   You are not the CEO  You are not the CEO of your product  you are not Steve Jobs  you are not a lone genius designing a product from your ivory tower  Never forget that as a product leader you are only as good as your team  and setting them up for success and giving them the space and air cover to do their best is ultimately how you and your product will be successful   Now just because you can pass the buck to someone higher up the chain of command doesn t mean you should  You should live and die by your product s success and failure anyway  because giving it your all is important whether you re the CEO or not   But one day    I think actually product leaders  not surprisingly  are often seen as great potential candidates for the CEO or COO when they get further on in their career  I think that s because at an executive level  all the product management attributes are really relevant because you re focused on the money  you re focused on the users  you re focused on the data  and you re focused on the future  says Tanya Cordrey  Non Executive Director   Digital Adviser at the  Schibsted Media Group   So while you may not be the CEO of anything right now  the funny thing is Product Leaders make for great CEOs and maybe some CEOs could do with acting more like Product Leaders  All those skills of leading without authority  moving mindsets  and setting your team up for success are what define great CEOs too  so if you want that title  keep working on those skills and who knows where you might end up   Enjoy what you ve read  Good  because there s an entire book full of this stuff   I ve been working with two masters of product Richard Banfield and Nate Walkingshaw on writing a book that all product professionals can benefit from  Partly out of curiosity and on the back of our own experience  we ve interviewed almost one hundred product leaders  Their insights and experiences will open up the conversation and take the lid off the mystery of great product leadership   The Product Leadership book is being published by O Reilly and will be out on shelves in May 2017 but you can pre order the book on Amazon today   You can follow us at  rmbanfield   bfgmartin  and

132,training-dataset/product/736.txt,product,The Permanent   Contract Dilemma for Product Professionals66 Flares 66 Flares    In this ProductTank talk I give a view of how being a contractor can change the types of roles  responsibilities  companies and skills required of  or available to  a product manager   This is based on my very personal experience  as a hiring manager and a product manager myself  and on conversations had with fellow contractors and recruiters in this space  Although of course your mileage may vary  I hope these experiences can provide some helpful insight for those wondering whether they should jump into the contracting world  as well as for hiring managers hesitating to take on contractors   Impact on Roles and Companies  Compared to other digital roles like developers  project managers  designers and so on  there is a lot of reticence to take on product managers as contractors because we have such a pivotal role to play in the team  In start ups especially  where we sometimes take over the day to day product ownership from the founder  the feeling is that they need someone with more  skin in the game    Adding to this the general rule a contractor will often be more costly than a permanent hire  and therefore will increase the  burn rate   I have found it  unfortunately  far more difficult to find opportunities with startups since I started contracting   Overall  contract positions represent about 10 15  of product manager roles available  so don t expect the phone to ring as often when you are looking for a new job   It is even more difficult for managerial positions  so you d better be ready to go back to  hands on  product management  unless you are ready to wait longer for the very senior opportunities    Skills   Requirements  As a contractor  because you are not looking for an internal promotion but for quick transitions to new roles at the end of your contract  you need to constantly  promote  yourself to the outside world and be visible to your network  which is not suitable for everyone s temperament   On the positive side  with the variety of roles that a contractor accumulates  there is probably less need for formal training  which is handy as I would need to pay for it from my own pocket  However  coming to ProductTank meetings is a great way for me to ensure I keep abreast of new ideas   From a hiring perspective  getting a contractor on board will usually give you a highly skilled team member  productive immediately  who will not require so much coaching or training  In fact  they could become a  trainer  for your existing team  bringing in fresh ideas and methods   Given that contractors are typically brought on board to fulfill very pressing needs  the role is often going to be mostly about delivering and not so much pure planning  So be ready to roll up your sleeves and forget about PowerPoint   Finally  I have found that I have to be even more agile and responsive about building trust with my teams and stakeholders  working against possible perceptions that a contractor does not  care  as much about their work or the company   To conclude   If you are a product manager  I suggest you run a quick compatibility test on yourself  do you prefer to have very clear deliverables  want to embrace changing challenges  and are not too worried about uncertainties in your own future  If that sounds like you  then you might enjoy contracting  If that sounds deeply unpleasant  then you should probably stick to permanent roles,"[132 1092 1340 802 24 600 605 302 423 1131 1168]"

140,training-dataset/product/1429.txt,product,Extensive New Product Development Stages OverviewTo create a new product in the company s product line  a team of experts will go through product development steps  Starting with the idea generation stages  the team moves through a number of stages to get all the details needed to come up with a tangible product  A new product development also goes through the same stages  however since this product has never been developed before  it comes with new risks and uncertainties  This article takes you through the new product development stages and explains what your team needs to do to achieve the goals set   Extensive New Product Development Stages Overview  Step 1  Generation  New product ideas can be obtained using SWOT analysis  Other methods that may be used to identify new product lines include market trends  competitors  focus groups  company s R D department  employees  salespeople  trade shows  ethnographic discovery methods or corporate spies   When generating new ideas  consider ROI  affordability and distribution costs  Moreover  the idea should be lean  mean and scalable  Keep the NPD process nimble and apply flexible discretion over the activities to be executed  Develop multiple road map versions scaled to suit various project types and risk levels   Step 2  Screening  In the first phase  many ideas would be generated but not all of them would be implemented  Idea screening involves eliminating unsound concepts before devoting any resources to them  Set the screening criteria based on the following factors   The benefits of the product to customers in the target market  The size and growth projections of the target market  The current or expected competition for the idea  The market trends and industry sales the idea is based on  Technical feasibility of manufacturing the product  The profitability of the product when manufactured and retailed at the projected price  Once you have set screening criteria  stick to it so that poor ideas can be dropped in the early stages   Step 3  Development and Testing  This phase involves developing the engineering and marketing details  Search patent databases to find out if there is a similar product that can raise intellectual property issues  Identify the target market and the decision maker when it comes to buying  Establish product features that must be incorporated into the product and still produce it in the most cost effective way   It is important to know the potential benefits of the product and how consumers will react to it  This is also the time to calculate the production cost  Testing the Idea can involve asking some potential customers what they think about the idea  Step 4  Business Analysis  Build a metric system to track progress  This includes input metrics  like average time in all the new product development stages  and output metrics that estimate the retail price based on completion and customer feedback  sales volume based on market size  profitability  break even point and other figures that offer valuable feedback  It is critical for the company to be in agreement with these criteria and metrics   Even if the idea doesn t seem viable after this analysis  keep it in the hopper as it can prove valuable for future products   Step 5  Beta and Market Tests  Producing a physical prototype  testing the product in typical usage situations and conducting group customer interviews or introducing the product at trade shows will provide you with useful information  enabling you to make last minute adjustments where necessary   Produce an initial product run and sell it in the target market area to establish customer acceptance  Moreover  this will help you to generate some buzz about the product   Step 6  Technical Implementation  As long as the technical aspects can be implemented without any alterations to the post beta stage  the product is definitely heading to the final stage   Here  all departments will be working to ensure the idea turns into a tangible product  The production department will set up the technical processes required to manufacture the product  The finance guys will provide the money required to introduce the new product from the manufacturing stage to the distribution stage  The marketing department will come up with plans on how to distribute the product  In each department  there are several activities taking place   Technical implementation after beta testing can be broken down into the following steps   New program initiation and finalizing quality management system  Resource estimation and requirement publication  Publication of technical communications like data sheets  Planning engineering operations and department scheduling  Supplier collaboration and logistics planning  Resource plan publication  Program review and monitoring  Step 7  Commercialization  At this stage  the product is launched into the market  consumers are buying it and the technical support is tracking progress  Producing and placing advertisements and promotions during this phase would attract more and more customers  thereby increasing sales and profitability of the product  Since many consumers are reluctant to buy new products that have never been used before  you need to invest a significant percentage of your budget in advertising and marketing  Keep your distribution pipelines packed with products  Critical path analysis is also an integral part of this process   Step 8  Product Pricing and Post Launch Review  The product can be introduced with temporary introductory pricing and then adjusted appropriately to the final prices after evaluating its impact on the market  The final pricing can be based upon value analysis  which involves making sure internal and external costs do overshadow the profits of the new product   current competition or alternative competitive technologies and projection of unit volumes and profit  Review the efficiency of the entire NPD process and make improvements where necessary  You can gauge consumer needs according to the sales and improve the delivery process   Product development is basically an ever evolving testing process characterized with errors  trashed designs and losses  Therefore  the team responsible should work in tight synchronicity to minimize these errors and ensure the successful launch of the product  even if it means adjusting the idea from the generation stage  Productivity can be achieved only if goals and contingencies are clearly defined in each of the new product development stages  Since both manufacturing and marketing skills are critical to the entire process  choosing a good blend of the two is recommended  This can be in the form of cross functional teams that are responsible for all aspects of the process from idea generation to commercialization,"[140 1287 530 379 1366 381 605 692 121 302 1067]"
142,training-dataset/product/1138.txt,product,Interview With Lea Hickman of InVisionThis post is part of a series of interviews that we are conducting with product leaders across various industries  In this interview series  product leaders share their advice with their fellow product managers  We hope this series will shed light on trends and challenges in the profession  and be helpful to new and experienced product managers alike   The following is a conversation with Lea Hickman  VP of Product Management at InVision  an award winning SaaS based product design collaboration platform   Lea is a tech industry veteran and before leading the product team at InVision  she was an executive at Adobe  AOL and Netscape  Here is Lea s story   1  How has product management changed over the years   Lea Hickman  LH   I think the fundamental catalyst to changing product management over the years has been the change in development processes  We are no longer in a world where we create 70 page PRDs and product specs to hand off to engineering  With the advent of agile and lean development methodologies  it s fundamentally changed the work a product manager does  Not only from a task perspective  but also the type of skills that are required   I remember early on in my career  product management was more like project management  It was someone who was part project manager  part systems analyst   where you were writing very detailed specifications  And thankfully  that has evolved into something where a product manager is more like a mini CEO  Someone who can understand holistically what the problems really are  identify if they re big enough problems to go after  and work with a core team to find the most efficient way s  to solve them   Here at InVision  we look for a very specific type of product manager  Our company solves workflow problems for design teams  so our product managers usually have a design background  The other key criteria is that they be very entrepreneurial  We typically look for folks who have founded or started their own companies   This provides the mindset of someone who is willing to play the mini CEO role  That person who s willing to jump in and be a critical thinker and a great problem solver  coupled with design skills   If they have those two fundamental skills  that s the recipe for our success on the product management side at InVision  Anything else  we can teach   2  What s the biggest product design challenge you ve encountered in your career and how did you solve it   LH  Throughout my career  the biggest challenge is probably when the iPad was first released  The iPad was introduced when I was at Adobe and we were looking to understand how users design on a tablet device   How would they naturally and intuitively think about creating design on a tablet  This was a completely different way of consuming information  We wondered  how could it be used to create content as well   The design challenge was focused around a different form factor  You have this device that has a camera attached to it and a completely different interface   touch  We spent a fair amount of time exploring ways to make that even better  and to leverage the device   Our CTO at the time was Kevin Lynch who firmly believed there was a great opportunity there  We did a lot of investigation and a lot of discovery work to understand how we could meet that need  We launched a few iPad products that did quite well  and got a lot of adoption  In fact  the artwork behind me  and I know no one s going to be able to see it  is an album cover that was created by a designer named Brian Yap  who used one of our tablet applications to do the illustration work   I m not entirely sure we solved it during that time frame   I m not sure it s solved today  but I think it s a very interesting challenge  in terms of how we can leverage different platforms to create content  There s promise and an audience for it  but I think designers need the power and precision of a more robust environment  That was the big takeaway   3  You led the charge when Adobe Creative Suite transitioned to a subscription based model  Do you have any recommendations for product managers on how they can best navigate big shifts in strategy   LH  On that particular project  especially considering the scale of it  hundreds and hundreds of people were involved   consistent and repetitive communication was absolutely critical  both verbally and written  I can t emphasize that enough  A product manager has to be obsessive about getting their story out and repeating it  Never assume that just because you already told someone  they re going to remember what the story is  or the why behind making a pivot   That was a huge takeaway  Over communicate  make it extremely consistent  and do it again and again and again  Also  be sure to pre vet key messages with your stakeholders   which is essential for making any major strategic shift  If you have an idea of how you want to shift something  meet with your stakeholders ahead of time and get their feedback prior to actually doing that broader communication   4  What advice do you have for uniting stakeholders around product strategy and getting buy in on the roadmap   LH  I always make sure that whenever there s a roadmap discussion  no one in the room is seeing the roadmap for the first time in that forum  I ve had the most resistance from stakeholders when they were surprised by something  Now  I take whatever draft I have  and I share it really early on  like prototyping  If you present your ideas and thoughts and start gathering feedback to course correct from the beginning  you ll earn your stakeholders trust since they will buy into the process with you   Then  take your early concepts  pre vet them again with your stakeholders  and ask them for help to refine and shape  This doesn t mean you re asking for their ideas  you re collaborating and bringing them along in the process   Nine times out of 10  this strategy will alleviate major conflicts you ll face when you have the official roadmap discussion or the official MVP discussion   5  What do you think are the most important skills for product managers   Tweet This    A great product manager believes in what they re creating  and has conviction around their ideas    LH  There are three traits I look for in product managers   Product managers need to be exceptional communicators  The more subtle  harder thing to interview for is conviction  A great product manager believes in what they re creating  and has conviction around their ideas  And by that  I don t mean falling in love with your idea  I mean having a defensible conviction about your idea and being able to stand behind it  and answer the  why   I talk a lot about the why  We often fall short in explaining the why to other people  and that s part of the conviction  If you can explain why you want to do something  you have conviction  The final trait is something that s important for me when I m hiring and in product managers I like to work with   a sense of humility  Understanding it s not about you  It s about getting an opportunity to shop for the product and get it into the hands of users   letting users decide   6  Are there any design principles you think successful products have in common   LH  It s research   but it s not the UX type of research most folks talk about  We do research a little differently at InVision  We recently invested in and hired our second ethnographic researcher  who evaluates people and cultures  I like this approach because if you can get at the root cause of a problem through research  you ll come up with an ultimate solution   For example  we work with a lot of companies  big and small  who have really incredible design teams  Airbnb  WeWork  IDEO  Adobe   If we present a proposal or review a prototype for a new feature  we re going to have a very short conversation with that team  where it s just about the solution we re putting in front of them   However  if we go in and observe how the team works  and we sit with them for a while  we begin to understand their problems  One of our ethnographers has a Ph D  in anthropology and sits with a few design teams a week  Through his observations  we re able to get at the root cause of the problems particular design teams are having  It helps us to ask   Is this a one off problem or is this a persistent problem  How many people are having this problem   This is step two of our research   You re basically sizing your market  Then  go into product discovery  which identifies solutions that address the root cause  When we think about design  we start at the root cause of the problem   Tweet This    When we think about design  we start at the root cause of the problem    Then listening to customers  observing them  and applying solutions  followed by UX testing and analysis  which determines the solution that will best meet those needs and address those core problems we ve uncovered  It s so foundational  giving you something you can build on and iterate on that yields great results   7  What are some of the challenges that UX UI teams have working together with Product Management  And what do you recommend to improve their interactions   LH  At InVision  we have this concept of a core team  which consists of three roles  the product manager  the design lead  and the development lead   The core team goes through all of that product discovery we talked about earlier  We found this process creates a lot of empathy across the roles and eliminates a lot of friction  particularly between the product manager and the UX or UI designer  From a velocity perspective  it cuts a lot of that friction out too  It helps these teams understand whether or not a particular design is going to be the most efficient to implement in real time   It allows the team to coalesce around that core MVP in terms of what it s delivering  You don t have a PM saying   I need feature x by y date   and then a designer creating things that are unimplementable and a developer saying   Wait a minute  I have a say in this too    I m a very strong believer that great ideas come from everywhere   design  development or product  As soon as you take that away  it removes a lot of that friction   8  What are some major product design trends that we can expect in 2017   LH  It s not so much about a design trend  but about designer trends  I m finding a lot of the lines are blurring across the product team  Similar to when I was talking earlier about how we put our product teams together   Tweet This    I think it s not so much about a design trend  but it s about designer trend    More and more designers are learning how to code  and product managers are learning how to design  The whole core mix of how we built products in the past and how we re going to be building products in the future is evolving   To learn these languages  the tools are making design so much easier  Everything is evolving so quickly  where before you needed to have very specific skill sets  The biggest trend is the explosion the simplification of the tooling is going to make anything possible,"[142 1116 423 605 793 98 1365 426 776 990 984]"
158,training-dataset/product/360.txt,product,Product Rockstars have Head  Hands  and Heart89 Flares 89 Flares    Every time you look behind a truly great product  you find people  The individuals who have created paradigm shifting  legacy leaving products are distinguished not merely by what they ve done  but also by who they are   Take a famous example  Thomas Edison pioneered the lightbulb  one of the greatest products of all time  He wasn t the first to create one  but the other products around at the same time were impractical for large scale commercial use  Edison tried and failed 1 000 times   in product speak  he went through 1 000 iterations   before he got to the product he was seeking  He had the ability to stick with a problem for a long time until he achieved his aim  Edison ought to be distinguished  not simply by his genius  but also by his determination  For him the perceived impossibility of his goal was not a deterrent   My case is a simple one  that when it comes to thinking about product managers  we often celebrate  what they do   and neglect the importance and necessity of being the right kind of person  or  who they are    I am convinced that this neglect is a major contributor to the dismal state of many products today  In his helpful book  Inspired  Marty Cagan discusses 12 character traits of a great PM  I ve boiled them down to the three most important and essential traits that I believe have the greatest impact on the success or failure of a product  They are Head  Hands and Heart   Head  There s no substitute for intellectual curiosity  the ability to reason and explore  As Cagan says   Product management is about insights and judgment  both of which require a sharp mind   Every product is a story  composed of all the decisions that went into creating it  To make the best decisions you must be well informed  and also able to deduce and reason  Cagan rightly points out that  these minds can be hidden anywhere   engineering  sales  customer services  the exec team or your board of directors  It s your job to find them   The best product managers have the mind of a scientist   Hands  A big part of Product Management is just plain getting your hands dirty hard work  You can care about customers and products  but you can t understand the best way to serve them if you have not done the hard work of understanding who they are  what motivates them and what they re using your product for  You can t create something 10 times better than the competition if you stop at the first roadblock  or if you are content with creating something average  Refining and rewiring every aspect of a product until it gets to the take a customers breath away level of quality takes a lot of heart  but also a huge amount of hard work   Without this hard work  you shouldn t expect to hear users say things like  I love it so much  I want to pay just to give them money  or  Driving a Tesla is a take your breath away moment   You want your users to sense instinctively that your product is superior  As Cagan says   If you have to actually ask or tell the product manager to come in to work during a critical point or otherwise point out to them that their presence is needed in the office  you have the wrong person for the job    Heart  If you remember only one thing  remember that a great product manager has a lot of heart  Cagan calls it  product passion   When a team has a product manager who is passionate and genuinely loves products  it is infectious   Cagan says these people  just love products   they live  eat  and breathe them   they  have a love and respect for good products  no matter where they come from  and they live to create them   When product rockstars are engaged in working on a product  they feel that this is the thing uniquely fitted to their talents   A good illustration of product passion is a recent article by Paul Pedrazzi on test driving a Tesla  He said   It s been a long time since I ve been floored by a product   knocked back on my heels by every aspect of the experience  Driving a Tesla is a take your breath away moment    Ignore This  and you shall be Extinct  Getting the  who  of product management right is crucial to the success of your product and organisation  Getting it wrong will lead to almost certain failure  Most organisations miss the mark and it s no surprise that very few organisations produce excellent results for an extended period of time   and far too many deteriorate into complete extinction   The problem I see is that few businesses are able to apply the level of rigour and conviction needed to see the effects that putting the right people in place can produce  As author on leadership Jim Collins puts it   It s easy to talk about paying attention to people decisions  but how many executives have the discipline of David Maxwell  who held off on developing a strategy until he got the right people in place  while the company was losing  1 million every single business day with  56 billion of loans underwater  When Maxwell became CEO of Fannie Mae  during its darkest days  the board desperately wanted to know how he was going to rescue the company  Despite immense pressure to act  to do something dramatic  to seize the wheel and start driving  Maxwell focused first on getting the right people on the Fannie Mae management team   Maxwell  unsurprisingly  achieved remarkable results once he got the right people in the right seats  but he had to be pretty daring   Another reason why these ideas will not move from theory to practice is that most organisations are designed from the top down  to focus on the  what they do  of great product management  and surprisingly optimised to miss the infinitely more important  who they are  as a result  It s also worth noting that  fanatically focusing on getting people with the right raw materials and developing them rigorously is a strategic weapon for the best organisations  Facebook for example has a  Rotational Product Management Programme  and Google has the  Associate Product Management Programme   These programmes are designed to find people with the most  head    hand  and  heart  and train them rigorously in the  what they do  aspects of product management  They have produced some of the best employees and products for these organisations   The vast majority of companies never become great  precisely because the vast majority become quite good   and that s their main problem   Whatever you do  don t assign the importance of finding  developing and empowering the right people to a  low  on your priority list  otherwise your products   and who knows even eventually your organisation   will end up obsolete,"[158 381 1116 98 1365 1131 356 121 24 692 776]"

170,training-dataset/product/1256.txt,product,How do you divide ownership between PMs Don t Ship the Org Chart  Part 1 How do you divide ownership between PMs   In a previous newsletter I laid out how product management organizations tend to evolve as startups grow  Today I d like to share more about what I called  PM Two    how do you split up responsibilities between multiple product managers   It s tempting to carve up the product in ways that line up cleanly with engineering  For example  one PM owns the front end and the other owns the back end  Or an iOS PM  an Android PM  and a desktop PM  The benefits here are obvious  each PM takes over a discrete chunk of the architecture  and they probably link up well to tech leads and individual engineers  Perfect  right   I want you to resist the urge to do this  Who is singularly accountable for the customer experience of the new account signup process  the front end PM or the back end PM  It s a little bit of everyone  And that s the problem  Inevitably these seams lead to friction and start to show through in your product    Organizations which design systems   are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations     Melvin Conway   The title of this newsletter is Steven Sinofsky s delightful rephrasing of Conway s Law    Organize your product managers around customers  not code repositories  Connect PM areas of ownership to users and their product experiences  Maybe you have a buyer PM and a seller PM instead of back end and front end PMs  Or in a healthcare company  you d have a PM responsible for the patient experience and another for the medical providers  When each PM has discrete ownership over an experience end to end  they can understand the customer problems more deeply and go all in on representing their needs  This is doubly important for companies where PMs need to spend time face to face with customers  such as enterprise startups   Here s another test  how many PMs need to be in the room  When I work with startups that are experimenting with ways to organize their product team  this ends up being a decisive test  Envision a feature you might want to build  such as rescheduling a doctor appointment  How many PMs need to be in the room when you talk about this feature  How many deciders  Is it one patient experience PM who has the final say  Or an iOS PM  an Android PM  an account system PM  a web PM  and a backend PM  you get the point   It s true that aligning your PMs with the user s view of the world can be messier in other ways  The development work is likely to cut across product surfaces   both the patient and doctor PMs will need something from the iOS engineers  for example  Who takes priority  It s important that as an organization everyone knows what the priorities are or this gets decided case by case in tiny inconsistent transactions  Having this conflict upfront is a feature  not a bug  It s more desirable to hash this out before engineers write a line of code  You ll need a good process to make quick prioritization decisions to avoid randomizing your engineering team   Recently many startups have also tried orienting their PMs around shorter lived themes or missions  such as  a one click dinner reservation experience  or  lightning fast photo uploads   The benefit here is a crystal clear goal that lines up with a customer problem  but it has the potential to generate serious thrash on the engineering side  At a minimum make sure there is at least one dedicated engineer and designer on each mission team   My last piece of advice when adding that second PM  know that this is temporary  and you re going to have to change it again  As with any re org  the biggest mistake you can make is assuming this is the re org to end all re orgs and you ve achieved perfection  Keep track of what s working well and what isn t  and be willing to change and adapt

anyone moving into PM  he brought with him both strengths and blind spots  It was interesting to match these to my own experience coming from engineering  For example  one of his strengths   comfort working cross functionally   didn t come naturally to me  Just goes to show that product management is a melting pot of skills from across the organization   It s the intersection of business  technology  and user experience  according to Martin Eriksson  who just reposted his influential What is a Product Manager  piece on Medium   Ask your team   What do we know to be true   Mike McCue  Flipboard s CEO  shares a story from his days running Tellme Networks when the company was faced with an existential crisis  After much angst  he boiled the problem down to first principles and the

192,training-dataset/product/1187.txt,product,Product Manager vs  Product OwnerWhat   As you may know  the product owner originated from Scrum  where the role is responsible for  maximising the value the product creates    1  This sounds like a text book product management responsibility to me  Nevertheless  the product owner is often regarded as a tactical role focused on managing the product backlog  detailing requirements  and interacting with the development team  How come   The confusion stems at least partly from the fact that Scrum is a simple framework focused on helping teams develop software  It does not cover common product management practices  such as  product strategy development  product roadmapping  and financial forecasting  and the only product management tool it offers is the product backlog   Additionally  some approaches like SAFe employ a separate product manager and product owner role  Using a strategic product role the product manager and a tactical one the product owner is a common scaling technique  It works particularly well when a product is stable or maturing  as I explain in my post  Scaling the Product Owner Role    But calling the tactical role  product owner  is an unfortunate mistake in my mind  The SAFe product owner is not the same as the Scrum product owner  Having two different product owner roles makes the confusion worse   So What   So why did Scrum introduce a product owner role at all  Why didn t the framework use the term product manager  When Scrum was developed in the 1990ies  product management was different from what it is today  Product managers used to do the upfront market research  product planning  and requirements definition work  They would then hand off a requirements specification to a project manager who would work with development and test to deliver the product  The product manager would return only to issue change requests or help with the launch   This is in stark contrast to the collaboration in an agile process where product people are required to collaborate with the development teams on an ongoing basis without neglecting the market and the internal stakeholders   Secondly  Scrum has been applied outside the realm of product development and commercial software products  Many organisations that have adopted Scrum like banks  retailers  and media companies traditionally don t have a product management group and hence no product mangers  But they do have digital products that either help market and sell their revenue generating offerings  such as  an online banking app  or they develop software that is used to automate business processes  increase productivity  and reduce cost   By offering the product owner role  these organisations can start working in an agile way without the immediate need to establish a product management group and initiate an organisational change process  Instead  employees from the appropriate business units can with some training and coaching act as product owners    In the long run  however  establishing a product management function is helpful  as I discuss in my post  Five Tips for Introducing Product Management to Your Company     Now What   So where does this leave us  My hope is that we will move past the divisive product manager product owner debate and just talk about product people   2   In the short term  we should acknowledge that the product owner is a product management role  People playing the role should therefore acquire the relevant product management skills  As Marty Cagan and others  including myself  have pointed out  a two day training course is not enough to become a competent product owner  Product management is a complex  multi faceted discipline that takes time and effort to master   Additionally  I recommend using either the term product manager or product owner in your company and qualifying it when necessary  for instance  by employing the terms senior and junior product manager   owner and strategic and tactical product manager   owner  This reduces confusion and helps unite people   What matters are not job roles and titles  It s the good we do for the users and our businesses   Notes   1  Scrum was first used at Easel Corporation in 1993 to create  the first object oriented design and analysis tool that incorporated round trip engineering  and      the first product to completely automate object relational mapping in an enterprise development environment   according to Jeff Sutherland  see  Inventing and Reinventing SCRUM in Five Companies    The first

302,training-dataset/product/1298.txt,product,Product Management Career Ladders at 8 Top Technology FirmsIndependence  Product Scope  Leadership  Slides  Product Management Career Ladders One of the areas I often mentor product managers on are the career paths available to them within the profession  Since there isn t a lot of discussion about this out there  I wanted to share what the career ladders look like for product managers at 8 top technology firms as well as some of the key dimensions upon which advancement in the profession occur Product organizations tend to be a small proportion of technology firm s overall R D teams  with ratios of up to 1 product manager to 10 engineers as common  Given this  companies tend not to focus on developing the same formalized career ladders compared to their engineering counterparts except at the largest tech firms who have achieved the scale of hundreds of product managers within their organization  The 8 technology firms whose career ladders I ve showcased below have all achieved this scale and have thus invested in career ladders for their respective product organizations Across all product organizations  I ve found the most common dimensions of advancement are independence  product scope  and leadership At the earliest stage of your career in product management  a key dimension of your advancement is the independence you exhibit in the role  Associate Product Managers and Product Managers are often expected to operate with some independence  but with regular supervision and check ins with their manager  As you advance to Senior Product Manager and beyond  you are expected to operate in the role completely independently from such supervision  This certainly doesn t mean that you shouldn t leverage your manager as a coach to help you through various product problems and challenges that you run into  as the best managers are able to offer advice to take your capabilities to the next level regardless of your current role  But instead it simply means that such check ins no longer become required for you to successfully execute on a given product initiative Independence is usually earned through accumulating and successfully executing against a variety of product initiatives across all stages of a product s lifecycle  including early product planning  customer research and validation  roadmap planning  product development sprints  beta testing  product launch  metrics analysis  and post launch iteration  The key to advancement along this dimension is both exhibiting that you ve had such experiences across the product lifecycle and as you ve encountered such new situations you ve been able to tackle the various challenges that you are presented with ease and minimal required supervision I encourage folks at the earliest stage of their career to seek out experiences that enable them to gain breadth of experience across the various phases of the product lifecycle as quickly as possible  Fast moving product teams with strong execution velocity allow you to build up such experiences as quickly as possible  I also encourage folks to take advantage of the ability to rotate across products in large tech firms in order to gain experiences in all stages of the product lifecycle since the product they are currently working on may not afford opportunities to learn about other stages The second important dimension of advancement in product management is product scope  Product scope covers both the overall amount of product functionality that you drive as well as the complexity of the product offerings you are responsible for  For example  a junior product manager may be responsible for feature enhancements to an existing feature in the product  Whereas a more seasoned product manager may be responsible for an entire feature area or product  including brand new product offerings that haven t existed before You typically see product scope increase from features  to feature areas  to a product  to multiple products  and potentially to suites of product offerings  You see complexity of product increase from incremental improvements to existing functionality to ownership of more complex product offerings  for example  Facebook News Feed  Google Search  etc  as well as to responsibility for innovation in new product categories I encourage product managers to first focus on exhibiting mastery of the given product area that they are responsible for  Such exhibited mastery will build the trust within the team that you can add more product areas to your scope  Once you ve been able to do so  it becomes important to find ways to find such increased scope  Proactive managers will help you find logical adjacencies that you could easily take on with ease  But it s equally the responsibility of product managers to seek out such opportunities and have meaningful conversations with their manager on what those could be I ve seen product managers increase their product scope by taking on existing product adjacencies  but also by tackling new product categories that the company is not yet involved with or simply leveraging the success of their existing product area to increase the product s ambition  Some of the fastest advancement I ve seen is in fact with folks who leveraged this last strategy Product management is largely a leadership role and it represents the third dimension of advancement in the profession  Initially this involves exhibiting mastery of the core dimensions of product leadership within your feature team  strong written and verbal communication  ability to articulate and evangelize your product area s vision and strategy  and your ability to drive the team to achieve it s shared objectives As you grow in your role  your scope of leadership influence expands beyond your feature team  the specific designers  developers  testers  etc that are implementing your features  to broader sets of folks within the organization  This includes cross team and cross disciplinary leadership  executive leadership  and customer leadership  The best product experiences span across individual product manager s ownership  therefore making it incredibly important that product managers can drive alignment with other product managers through strong cross team product leadership  Similarly the actual product only speaks to a part of the customer s journey with a given product  so it s important to develop strong cross disciplinary leadership across marketing  customer service  sales  and more  Executive leadership  or ability to manage up to the executive team within your company  becomes critical to evangelize investment in new product categories as well as accelerate investment in existing product areas  And finally  customer leadership involves the ability for product managers to directly engage with and influence customers of your product An independent aspect of leadership that becomes critical for advancement in the profession is your ability to lead and manage a team of product managers  You ll find that most career paths in product management ultimately branch into two paths  one for the individual contributor and the other for a people manager  Individual contributors continue to increase their product scope and leadership as described above  People managers  on the other hand  increase their leadership through mentoring  coaching  and driving results through a team of product managers that report to them  While most product organizations allow advancement for individual contributors to very senior levels such as Principal Product Manager or equivalent  the highest level roles within the profession remain reserved for those along the people management path  Those along the people management path exhibit their mastery through their ability to effectively mentor and coach their team  their ability to drive strong operational results through team members  and their ability to coalesce and align the team along a broad vision encompassing all of the individual product areas The above slides showcase the specific product management titles and career paths of 8 top technology firms  including Amazon  Facebook  Google  LinkedIn  Microsoft  Salesforce  Twitter  and Uber  You ll notice many similarities between many of the firms  as the titles and levels have evolved together over time and also allow mobility between organizations  You ll notice a few notable exceptions though  including Facebook that has chosen a very flat title structure compared to other organizations  though internal leveling within each title allows for them to compensate and reward individuals more specifically  Amazon has also taken a different approach with their more senior roles  which can be more cross functional in nature I hope this gives you a sense of the career ladders most common in product management roles as well as some of the key dimensions of advancement that you ll need to master as a product manager to accelerate your own success in the role,"[302 1092 24 1340 98 1365 356 192 605 802 121]"

338,training-dataset/product/711.txt,product,Balancing product impact and seniority in a PM careerOff the Rails Balancing product impact and seniority in a PM career  I enjoyed this interview with Hunter Walk about product management career paths  Hunter describes his journey toward an increasing recognition that  seniority and title or who you managed doesn t necessarily translate into immediate impact on the product    I too recognized some years ago that I was happiest when I had the most direct impact on the product  In more senior roles  such as director and up in big companies   your product impact counterintuitively might be reduced  Sure  you have considerably more leverage across the organization  a more direct connection to senior executives  and more power when it comes to wielding resources  But day to day  the PMs who work for you are making the decisions that will determine the success or failure of the products  Your job is mostly about helping them  not the product   This matters because at most companies the product management career path is on rails  toward expanding managerial responsibilities  general management  and eventually to becoming a CEO  Unlike in engineering where there is often a dual path that rewards individual contribution  the default assumption is that product managers want to become CEOs and should keep advancing  Some years ago I recognized that I wasn t so interested in being a CEO  and that I wanted to stay as close to the metal as possible when it came to building products  I enjoyed mentoring other PMs  but not managing managers  nor the interdepartmental politics and endless meetings that result  It took me some years to find my perfect balance for me it was having only 3 5 direct reports at the group product manager level at Google   Ask yourself where you want to be in five years  and then in ten years  Will you be a CEO  A director  A founder  A general manager  Or still a product manager but with elevated scope and impact  You re always free to change your mind  of course  but how you answer should shape how you approach the next several years of your career  You ll be pushed toward general management unless you take steps to aim in a different direction   CEOs and founders should also broaden the career opportunities they provide for their PMs  My hope is that as product management matures  companies will embrace a dual ladder career track for PMs much as they do for engineers  This would give strong contributors an alternative to reluctantly moving into management  Letting people go where they ll be happiest and contribute the most serves everyone   As Hunter says   Ultimately  if Google had created a product track that gave me a chance to influence the product s future direction  without necessarily having to be responsible for three dozen people and the politics associated  maybe I would have moved into that role as opposed to leaving    Good Reads   I think ultimately most companies will adopt more and more machine learning over time because it is going to be powerful and transformative for their business   Check out this interview with the legendary Jeff Dean about ML at Google  TensorFlow  and the future of machine learning    The more powerful you are  the less you should assume you re right   That s the advice from Stanford GSB professor Brian Lowery   Think of  power  as fire  It s useful  but it s also dangerous    A day without meetings  How my GV partner John Zeratsky wiped  cleaned  and defragged his calendar   If you want to know how the smartphone has affected the PC and tablet industry  you need only glance at the chart in this article   Product Jobs  Subscribe to the newsletter to see these job listings   Previous newsletters,"[338 236 802 46 98 1365 302 24 22 1092 776]"

existing experience    To ensure the new experience is better  ensure statistical significance of the A B test results  The area I most often get asked to help product managers on is preparing them for their upcoming product management interviews  Given that I ve evaluated hundreds of product management candidates  I wanted to share a set of sample interview questions I might ask and what I m specifically evaluating on to discern whether they are a great product management candidate Keep in mind that while these were common questions I personally asked product managers that I interviewed at LinkedIn  there is no standard set of questions nor interview template at LinkedIn  Every interviewer is encouraged to ask whatever set of questions they felt appropriate to help them evaluate the core competencies they were testing for  So don t expect to receive these specific questions  but instead this should help you understand the competencies that are typically being tested for in product management interviews I always start my interviews by giving a quick overview of who I am  what team I m on  and my role to give the candidate a sense for who they are talking to Extra credit for folks who use this opportunity to tell me something about me  mutual friends we have  common past employers  congrats on a product launch  etc  to indicate they did their homework and researched me prior to the interview While I ve already reviewed their resume prior to the interview and am familiar with their background  what I m interested in seeing is if they can provide a compelling narrative of their own background in a succinct summary  It s a great way to understand how well the candidate can present and convince others of their ideas  so I m evaluating for communication and leadership competencies here  Negative points for rambling answers or for simply presenting a laundry list of their experiences with no clear rationale for the career transitions they ve made to date I ll take one of their past roles that they either described above or I saw in their resume and drill into the specifics of their roles and responsibilities  I want to understand how much of the product development process did they actually drive  I ll go in depth into the specifics of the products they have worked on to understand which of the following PM responsibilities they were directly involved with  Given every product role differs at each company  it s important for me to understand where their experience and strengths lie  The more senior the role  the more of these experiences I expect PMs to have had in their career  But not having participated in every single one is not necessarily a blocker either If they were previously in engineering  marketing  consulting roles  or straight out of college  I want to make sure they understand the product management role and responsibilities  I m looking for them to relay many of the core PM responsibilities back to me I m looking for passion for LinkedIn s core product  I also use this as an opportunity to ensure they understand the consumer value proposition of LinkedIn Sometimes I also ask for a feature suggestion for LinkedIn  I use this to see at what level they think at  some people provide a detailed feature suggestion based on their existing usage of LinkedIn  Others suggest a brand new product area that LinkedIn should add to it s offering  I want to make sure that the level of their feature suggestion is appropriate for their level  And I ll also ensure that the feature suggestion is aligned with our strategy  I ll usually get into a discussion of how they would evaluate prioritizing this feature suggestion against the existing LinkedIn roadmap to understand how they think through a prioritization exercise I m looking for the candidate to relay LinkedIn s 3 revenue lines  1  talent solutions  2  marketing solutions  and 3  premium subscriptionsI m also looking for them to detail the different user segments our free and paid products address  consumers  recruiters  sales professionals  job seekers  marketers  etc I also ask where they think the biggest growth opportunity lies amongst those businesses  Here I m not looking for their analysis to match LinkedIn s internal assessment of growth drivers  I m simply looking to see if they can self identity potential growth drivers and their rationale for relative growth differentiation between the businesses Here I m looking for them to pick an app from memory that they believe is truly well designed  I want them to detail the problem the app is solving  and why they believe it is well designed in solving it  I m looking for depth of insight into the design  whether it s interaction design  overall user experience  certain app mechanics  clever uses of the mobile form factor  how they differentiate from alternative offerings  etc I typically also ask what would they add to the app if they could to see how critically they think about the apps that they use on a regular basis Negative points for the following I spend the bulk of the interview going through a case question  The goal is to get the candidate to think about a product design challenge and walk me through how they would think about defining success  improving the product  and then ensuring they met their earlier stated success metrics  I rotate between a few case questions  Here is an example of such a case question LinkedIn s home page has a social stream similar to other social sites on the Internet  Our goal is to provide relevant updates on your connections as well as professional insights to enable you to be great at what you do  We may present to you articles shared by your network relevant to your industry  Or what s going on with your network  including job changes  promotions  and more The exercise I want to discuss is how would you go about improving the personalization and relevance of LinkedIn s social stream  Let s start with how you would measure success  what potential improvements you would suggest  and how you would go about determining if those improvements worked For the success metrics  I m looking for them to break down the high level goal of a more relevant and personalized home page to specific measures that can easily be tracked to ensure we are achieving that high level goal I m looking for some subset of the following When they come up with ideas for improving the relevance and personalization  I m looking for them to provide insight into the various user signals that can be leveraged to improve recommendations that apply generally to improve recommendations and personalization for most consumer websites While the specific suggestions vary widely  the following are the classes of signals I m looking for them to identify via their suggestions We ll usually go in depth on one specific suggestion to understand whether the candidate knows how they would go from idea to bringing the improvement to life After they have implemented their suggestion  I m looking to make sure they understand how to properly run a test to ensure that the new experience is indeed better I m looking for them to identify the following The candidate should always have questions prepared  Hearing them will give me a sense for what they are most interested in  what concerns they have  and their depth of understanding of the product role  company  culture  and more I encourage anyone interviewing for a product role to also check out these excellent

381,training-dataset/product/1197.txt,product,FI co  How to Build a Product People LoveBuilding a product that people like is hard  but building a product that people love is even harder  However  regardless of how challenging the product development process is  it is possible to create an offering that resonates with a wide audience  if somewhat improbable  Luckily  this blog post features a wealth of product building insights from Evernote co founder and executive chairman Phil Libin  from what makes a great product to getting feedback on you product to and more   What is a Great Product   Defining a great product is a daunting task  but there are at least a couple key characteristics that all great products have   Great products have a point of view  Great products aren t neutral  meaning they are created by people who have a specific point of view of how the world is supposed to work through this product  Great products don t rely on the user to do anything  It isn t the user s job to do anything  so a great product should reduce   or eliminate   the amount of work a user needs to do get stuff done   How Do You Convince Your Team to Love Your Product   Put simply  the best way to make your team members love the product they re building is to make sure they love their job  For many  if not most people  work is merely a means to an end  a way to pay the bills and put their kids through college  And if you re in a managerial role  it s next to impossible for you to force more and better work from unhappy employees   Happiness in the workplace not only defines the current product your company is building at the moment  but every product you build in the future  especially during the product development life cycle  Therefore  it s important for company leaders to take the time to prioritize employee morale by creating a comfortable  creative environment that is as stress free as possible  but in the startup world  there are bound to be stressful times   Also  be sure to instill in your team the importance of the product they re working on  as well as the direct effect that the product has on the world   Another tip to help motivate your employees is to  as Phil Libin puts it   make the product for yourself   This means that if you continuously build a product for a market or customer base that you don t care about or are not interested in  your company will remain in product market fit mode  But if you and your team build a product with yourselves in mind  iteration cycles will take far less time and the work will be more fulfilling for everyone   If you re honest with yourself and you re making a product for you  you can know when it s getting better  You can know when you re really being in love with certain features  You can know when it s going backwards  You can know because you re the target audience     Phil Libin  How Do You Test Your Passion for Your Product   This is a pretty simple answer  If you are building a product for an industry that you re interested in and yet you have to force yourself to become excited about it  you should probably do something else   However  if you are genuinely excited about working in a specific industry and you feel like you re the world s foremost expert in your field  even if you re not   then you re most likely on the right track   What Do You Do When You Have an Idea for a Product   Most  if not all  entrepreneurs are familiar with the thrill of coming up with or stumbling upon what they think is an amazing idea for a product  But too many of them get so caught up in the idea that they do little to bring it outside of the artificial world that exists in their own minds   While the obvious choice is to get as much feedback as possible from industry experts and potential co founders  this may not always be the most constructive idea  either  as outside influences can often serve only to fan the flames of excitement  And because of this  founders become more excited about the idea of launching a company rather than build a meaningful product   So  if you have an idea for a potentially great product  what should you do then  The answer  get feedback from people who have not stake in the product or company you re trying to build  as they will give you the most honest feedback  That means meet with people who aren t startup mentors or potential co founders or industry experts  as these types of people will most likely give you biased feedback  Remember  if the average person has trouble understanding how your dream product works  many others probably will  too   How Do You Remain Objective When Getting Different Kinds of Feedback   While maintaining some sense of objectivity is important when creating your product development plany  sometimes it s good to just follow your passion and see where it leads you  Think of it this way  anybody who thinks that quitting their job and launching a startup is a good idea should not quit their job and launch a startup  because it is incredibly risky and may very well ruin whoever tries   But  with the odds stacked against you  your secret weapon is your undying passion and unconditional love for your idea  Your best bet is to talk to as many people as you can and  after getting considerable feedback  determine if you re still interested in your idea  If you are  then go for it  However  if you start finding ways to defend your idea s viability to yourself  then find something else to do   Don t Invent the Hammer Before Finding the Nail  Yet another mistake that both beginning and experienced founders make during their product development strategy is that they build a technology   The Hammer   before they determine what problem   The Nail   that technology is trying to solve  This is just another way that entrepreneurs become so enamored with the thrill of launching a company that they delude themselves into inventing a problem that either doesn t need a solution or just doesn t even exist   The best way to cognitively prevent yourself from inventing a problem for your product is to focus less on dreaming up an amazing piece of innovative technology  and focus more on a widespread problem that many people experience  And not only must the problem be prevalent enough to ensure a large user base  it also has to be one that customers would be willing to pay money for and put in the time and effort to adapt to their current routine or process   How Do You Determine if People Care About Your Product   While there are numerous metrics that a founder can employ to measure a user s love for their product  one of the most important metrics  if not the most important metric  is customer retention rate  In fact  retention rate is much more important than other common metrics like growth rate and conversion  because if customers aren t sticking with your product on a long term basis  all of your other metrics will drop because of that   Anybody can fall in love with a brand new product that promises to solve their problems  but but few people actually care enough about a product to continuously use it  and upgrade to newer models  In short  if you re product can not only attract users but keep them  you ve just built a product that people love   There are two main types of retention that founders should test after they ve launched their product   Short term  Depending on the type of product you ve built  it will take some time for a customer to familiarize themselves with it and decide if they like it  This may be a few hours or days or longer  If customers continue to use your product after that initial trial period  then you re off to a good start  Long term  Once your customer has decided to use your product  find out if they are still using after considerable time has passed  like weeks or months later  Remember  the longer they continue to use your product after trying it out  the better the retention rate  Of the two retention types  this one  of course  is the most important    Business team work building puzzle symbolizing working together finding solutions to a problem image by Shutterstock,"[381 1116 692 423

and continued to mature  It was also a year when an awful lot more of you started to read our blog more regularly   we ve ended the year with an awesome 30  year on year growth in our readership  But what did you all want to read and learn about  Was it insight  opinion  guidance on how to get the best out of colleagues or to make your voice heard  career advice  best practices  or something more fundamental  I think what marks out the following is that they all deliver practical and actionable advice   advice which can be applied by anyone at any stage in their product career   Here s a look at what we learned in 2016 based on our most read posts during the year   Scope of the job  Lots of us are still trying to work out what the scope of a product management role should be and how it should be applied within their organisations  A ProductTank presentation  Product Management Fundamentals  from Dag Olav Norem looked at why the role of a product manager exists  He gave an overview of what the role involves and what you need to focus on to be successful in the role  He counsels us to learn to love the hard parts  as our  role is not to create value directly  but to enable everyone else to    One of the challenges with being a PM is that you are supposedly responsible for so many things  yet you are not the boss of anyone    How do you stretch yourself and get the most out of your role  Make yourself uncomfortable was the advice of Ken Norton from Google Ventures  speaking at our San Francisco conference this year  In his talk Product Managers  Please Make Yourselves Uncomfortable  Norton urged us to get uncomfortable through a music lesson  specifically a lesson in jazz  Norton draws a number of valuable analogies between jazz and product management and urges us to  get uncomfortable  listen carefully and let everyone solo   And perhaps listen more to Miles Davis   I ended up buying a record player and Kind of Blue on vinyl after this talk   Get the Best out of Others  Product Owners  How to get Your Development Team to Love you was a post from Daniel Elizalde with some relationship advice  product management style  via a ProductTank presentation from former Apple Product Manager and industry veteran Ron Lichty  Ron is someone who knows how to  make software development hum  and has an  an eye for what keeps teams from achieving clarity out of chaos   How do product owners get their development teams to love them  It s about partnership when all is said and done  and  nothing breaks the partnership model like micromanagement   from any source  But nothing beats partnership for synergy and unexpected brilliance    Organise around customers  Ways to improve the user experience was as big a theme in 2016 as ever and in The Experience is the Product  another talk from the San Francisco conference  Peter Merholz spoke about the need to focus on the user experience  It s important to understand that we who are building these products and services know things that our users don t  A digital product is made up of a user experience  wrapped around some business logic  wrapped around some data  Perhaps product management is becoming a misnomer  Instead we should be focused on the experience  and on the service that delivers that experience  And to deliver a coherent service experience we need to rethink how we structure our teams   instead of aligning our product and design teams around features or products  we have to organise ourselves around customers   Practical Advice on Tools and Methodologies  Several of our most read posts of 2016 are practical guides  full of advice and the hard won experiences of product experts   Two came from Suzie Prince  head of product at Thoughtworks Studios  and focused on continuous delivery and devops  Why Continuous Delivery and DevOps are Product Managers  Best Friends looked at why product managers should care about continuous delivery and devops  There s a multitude of reasons   continuous delivery is transformative to businesses  it will help you get feedback sooner  it reduces waste and risk  and it facilitates the creation of higher quality products  It also makes for better teams  And our top post of the year was Prince s Product Manager s Guide to Continuous Delivery and DevOps  This opens up and demystifies these practices with definitions  examples  easy to understand diagrams  and suggestions for further reading  Suzie s post both educates and entertains and is full of practical advice and  as Suzie says  its point is  to empower you and inform you about technical practices that are meant to be business relevant    Ramon Guiu s post From Waterfall to Agile  A Product Manager Transition clearly chimed with many in the community  He looked at his journey from Waterfall to Agile  the pros and cons of each approach and how his role as his company s first product manager changed as the company grew and his expertise developed  The Day To Day Product Management Toolkit  a ProductTank presentation in Oslo from one of my cofounders  Janna Bastow  focused on really practical advice   what tools product managers should use and how they should use them  It s a hands on guide that looks at what tools Janna has used or still uses with tips on which to use for different product management tasks   My own clarion call  Product Requirement Documents Must Die  asked that we should once and for all stop wasting our time by writing product requirement documents and focus instead on a more efficient  collaborative and iterative process for product development  Whether you re doing user story mapping  design sprints  or any other technique  collaboration will yield faster  clearer results because they were achieved in conversation with each other  Prototypes   whether they are user flows in post it notes  a page sketched up on paper  or a functioning interactive prototype   are essential because they showcase the actual experience and can generate discussion internally  Then once you have some prototypes in place  test them   over and over again   to refine not just the user flow and usability  but also the desirability of the product  and thus its feasibility in the market   Product Management is Ownership  The London conference round up  What we Learned at Mind The Product 2016  was one of our top five posts in 2016  It was a day full of inspiring and entertaining talks from product leaders  so there was much to absorb and learn  Many themes emerged as fundamental aspects of a product manager s role   storytelling  listening to customers  building teams that can work effectively to name a few   but the one overarching theme was that of ownership  We saw that building great products is ultimately about ownership  whether it is ownership of the problem  the solution  the story  the process  the discipline  or the action  Most importantly this is ownership by the team as a whole   not solely the product manager   More Reading  Top 10 ProductTank and Mind the Product talks of 2016  Top 10 Guest Posts on Mind the Product in 2016  Keeping an Eye on the Future  Next week we ll

shrinking  customer demands that are always increasing and a supply chain system that is getting more complex  As a result  bringing winning products to the market has become quite challenging  It s now very essential to achieve operational excellence and this is only possible through the use of proper life cycle management systems  Among other things  the systems enable businesses to   Achieve target margins  Ensure regulatory compliance  Shorten cycle times while at the same time maximizing product pipeline throughput  All these aspects are essential if the business is to remain

your business  The system tends to be more effective if it s built upon a scalable  secure and standards based open architecture platform  This ensures quick and cost effective implementations that will help the business to thrive   Managing the Enterprise Product Record  Any business expert will agree that products define the profitability  competitive advantage as well as the long term growth of major businesses  An enterprise product record is the important intellectual asset that has the information that defines a product at each and every stage in its entire lifecycle  All the information required to design  build  source  conceptualize  sell  dispose and even service products is contained in the product record  An agile lifecycle management system should be able to accurately highlight   Customer relationship management systems  These are used to manage the records of all customers   Supply management systems  These are used to manage the records of the suppliers   Enterprise resource planning  These are used to manage all financial records   Human capital management  These are used to manage all employee records   Some of the key industries that the lifecycle management system can be able to spearhead include   High technology  Life sciences  Automotive industry  Defense and aerospace  Industrial manufacturing  Consumer goods  Optimizing the Global Product Network  Some of the priorities of a good product lifecycle management system include the management of product information as well as creating a single enterprise product  It is however important to go further and look for a broader solution that enables your business to improve the management of cross functional product lifecycle processes in the business  This should happen across all product networks worldwide  There s no doubt that complex enterprises could definitely benefit from this system as it has been built very uniquely from the ground up   Accelerating Time to Market  This is a very delicate part of any business and you wouldn t want to have any setbacks here  The ideal product lifecycle management system should enable your teams to efficiently collaborate

accelerated   Minimizing Cost  It s always important to minimize costs whenever a product network extends all around the world  The product lifecycle management system makes this possible by streamlining and formalizing all the cost management processes  The system gives managers enough analytical power as well as the tools and information they need to apply their good business insight  Their skills are essential to cost management and this can only be improved if they work with a system that improves their ability to do so   Improving Product Quality  Managing the manufacturing and design aspects of a growing company is not easy  However  with the product lifecycle management system  it becomes easier to put the necessary product improvements that are required to improve customer satisfaction as well as the quality of the products dispatched   Ensuring Regulatory Compliance  The system makes it a lot easier to manage compliance processes and documentation across your entire product network  across all the countries that you re in business  You can easily be able to manage efficiency  compliance and lifecycle processes of your auditable products  This ensures that

 The lifecycle management system enables all your teams across the globe to be able to collaborate in real time thus improving the innovation in your business   Driving Strategic and Operational Decisions  If your business is to become successful  you need to be able to leverage analytical capabilities and decision support systems  A well designed product lifecycle management system will provide your business with out of the box support systems for all decisions  These will include comprehensive analytics  capabilities for advanced custom reporting as well as standard quality reports

419,training-dataset/product/75.txt,product,How do you make sure your new PM is successful Three    Two    One    Go How do you make sure your new PM is successful   After much discussion  your startup   or division at a larger company   has decided it s time to hire its first product manager  You can finally breathe a sigh of relief  How do you make sure they re successful   I ve written about the first days at a new company from the PM s perspective  but what about from the other side  These early weeks are pivotal  and can determine whether your new PM is a success or a failure  Here are some do s and don ts  Although directed toward product founders  CEOs  and general managers hiring their first PM  this advice also applies to anyone adding a PM to the team  at companies of any size   Do   Regular Mind Melds  Your PM needs to understand your vision for the product and everything you ve learned about your customers  Eventually your PM should be able to channel you when you re not in the room  they ll develop instincts for what you d say if you were there  What are you most passionate about  what irks you  and where are the third rails of your product   Remember how Spock could touch someone s face and share their thoughts telepathically  This was the topic of my newsletter a couple weeks ago  This isn t just a one time brain transfer but something that needs to be done regularly to ensure there isn t drift between your vision and the PM s vision  Nothing else matters if you and the PM aren t on the same page   Decide on a review process  With your PM  determine how you ll handle launch approvals and staying involved in the day to day decisions  You ll probably want to institute a lightweight product review process that doesn t slow down the team or leave them in the dark  What kinds of decisions do you want escalated  It doesn t need to be unnecessarily bureaucratic  but everyone needs to understand it  Be clear  and write it down  Eventually a good PM will be skilled at recognizing when to make a spot decision and when to escalate to you  but it might be rocky in the beginning   Early on  a weekly product review with the team and a weekly one on one with your PM are good guidelines  Keep in mind that your off the cuff opinions and suggestions can be interpreted as gospel  Many a Product CEO has tossed out a half formed idea and been surprised to discover their team dropped everything and worked through the weekend to make it a reality   Reinforce their authority  Shortly after I started as the first PM at a startup  one of the engineers walked over to our CEO s desk and asked him to make a decision on a small product feature  The first thing the CEO said was   Has Ken already seen this   Small actions helped establish my authority  and avoided randomizing the rest of the team  Understand that the team has collective muscle memory to come to you directly for product decisions  That certainly doesn t mean everyone now has to go through the PM to talk to you or get your feedback  just that your PM needs to be in the loop   Dedicate some time to think about the future  Take this opportunity to refresh your long term vision for your product  Spend some time thinking about the future  reading  and brushing up on new products and technology  This doesn t need to be a full fledged Bill Gates  think week   it could be as simple as blocking out a morning on your calendar  Share the ideas that take shape with your PM and then write a document or prepare a presentation for the company   Don t   Hand off janitorial work and keep the fun stuff  You re a Product Founder  and it s not going to be easy for you to step away from day to day stewardship of your product  Sometimes it s tempting to let the new PM take over tasks like managing the bug queue and writing documentation  but keep all of the exciting product decisions to yourself  Being a PM is certainly part janitor  but if you treat your new PM as a glorified task manager  you ll drive them away  and you won t accomplish your goal in hiring them  to give you more time for the rest of your job    Check out of the product completely  You re not handing off the product  you re moving from day to day PM to owner of the product vision  One of the worst things you could do is walk away from the product completely and leave your new PM blowing in the wind  As Ben Horowitz says  if  you cannot let go a little without letting go entirely  you should consider a CEO change   Publicly undermine them  If you disagree with your PM s decision  take it up with them privately first  If you re seen to overrule them the team will in short time decide that the PM s opinion doesn t count for much  and they ll wait to hear from you directly on every decision  This is why weekly one on ones with your PM are so important  it gives you an opportunity to review progress and share your concerns without airing the laundry in front of your team  This is another recommendation that will evolve over time  It s a sign of a healthy team to be able to disagree and debate in the open  But in these early days you can completely undermine a PM s authority   One of my favorite articles on this topic is by Ben Horowitz  Why Founders Fail  The Product CEO Paradox  After the Product Founder CEO steps back from day to day stewardship of the product  Ben argues that their essential responsibilities must include   Keeping and driving the product vision  Maintaining the quality standard  Being the integrator  Making people consider the data they don t have  Once again  Ben s advice doesn t only apply to founders   it s useful for anyone reducing their involvement in day to day product decisions   What s worked for you  and what hasn t  Share your stories with me   email protected   Go Forth    It s not a human move  I ve never seen a human play this move  So beautiful     Fan Hui  professional Go player and AlphaGo advisor  Win small or lose big  We ve been enthralled watching a computer finally beat a human master in the 2 500 year old game of Go  AlphaGo  from Google s DeepMind unit  beat South Korea s Lee Sedol four games to one  If you re like me and know little about Go  you ll enjoy this Wired article that helps us understand the historical significance of this moment   When humans play games  we tend toward moves that will help us win big  That means we might favor an action less likely to help us win by a larger margin over one more certain to help us win by a single point  For example  an American football team might go for the touchdown to get seven points and run up the score when the surer three point field goal would increase the likelihood of a win  The psychology is fascinating  and combines pride  loss aversion  retaliation  and innumeracy   We also draw analogies to the physical world as a simplifying technique  which may further weaken our abilities    AlphaGo is immune from these weaknesses  What s fascinating about AlphaGo is that it doesn t care how much it wins by  just that it wins  The margin of victory is irrelevant  So AlphaGo slowly builds up the probability of a win while the human observers think the game is too close to call  like a cat toying with its prey   Lee Sedol s victory in the fourth match in some ways is the exception that proved the rule  Sedol won by playing a move that was so completely unexpected it introduced new complications and forced AlphaGo to make a mistake   Read more about that here and here   When Lee Sedol entered the post game press conference

423,training-dataset/product/884.txt,product,Product design is a team sportDear client   Know that your product is of utmost importance to us designers  We want it to be exceptional  we want it to be successful  and we want it to evolve as time goes by   More than anything  we want to do everything in our power to serve your product   But here s what prevents us from doing so  loneliness   Not the kind that makes us cry into our pillows  It s a whole other kind of loneliness the kind where we end up attached to a development team like a fifth wheel to a coach   Useful  sure  but slightly uncomfortable  A lone product designer on a team will do their best  but not the best that could be achieved in a given situation if they had company   Related  How to build trust with your team  We re writing to you now to address this problem  In short  open your pockets a little wider and work with 2 or more product designers on your team  you beautiful  business savvy  clever person  you   Why  Well  we ve prepared 5 handy exercises that ll help you determine how many designers are or will be necessary for your project  All we ask in return is that you be honest with yourself   Life is like a role playing game  designers assign their skill points to specialize  This isn t obvious  but product design involves a whole bunch of different skills  So it makes sense that a person responsible for making a product successful needs to know about business strategy and UX research and they should have some experience with prototyping  visual design  animation  and   Yeah  no  It does not make sense   Most product designers probably do have an extensive skill set  but why would you want someone who is only  adequate  at interaction design to be in charge of designing your interactive application  You wouldn t   You d most likely prefer to pay money for a professional grade of service   Professional  meaning excellent in every way and meeting all your needs  including the ones you don t know about   Adequate  just doesn t cut it   Building a team of experts with varying skill sets might save your product from failure  This is especially true if your product requires specialized technologies or approaches   Think about it  Do you really want to make compromises and sacrifice your vision because your team doesn t have the necessary experience   At the very least  make this early choice when you re fully aware of the consequences   Problem solving  If only designers could be upgraded with extra brains  Do you have any idea of how very human designers are  We make mistakes  Our designs aren t always as good as we think they are  We try we really do  But sometimes we don t spot all the faults in our work   It s an easy trap to fall into  Sometimes  we just don t have the brain capacity to understand everything about your product  remember about everything that s important for its success  and think of every possible way in which users might interact with it   Do you know what would help  Someone to talk to  And no  our spouses  children  and pets won t solve the problem   Sure  user testing is an absolute must anyway  and isn t that a fantastic opportunity to socialize  But we re talking about early stage design and everyday work at the office  We re talking about brainstorming sessions  attention to detail that rivals that of Hieronymus Bosch  and fast  furious  essential feedback   Mutual design critique helps us see those nasty little things we stumbled over during the design process we tell each other what s good  what s bad  and what needs improvement  Fast feedback  from a person as knowledgeable about the product as we are  means we don t get stuck when something isn t quite working properly  Attention to detail is built into our brains by now  but do you and should you always trust your brain completely   We are your team  We want the same thing  smooth  fast  efficient product design  Consider how much this means to you   When the product is not ready to be ready  There comes a time when the product needs to be released  Thrown to the wolves  Pushed out of the nest   Sometimes  this is a good thing  When the product is as mature as it can be with a team of developers and one designer fussing over it  it ll benefit from experiencing the real world  If all goes well  it ll keep growing and engaging more and more users  More on that in a bit   Related  7 free resources every product designer needs  Other times  though  the product isn t ready  The product won t even be in the vicinity of ready for a really long time  And yet  the product gets released   Launch  Speed to its death  Crash  Goodbye   Who would want that  Nobody wants that especially the designer responsible but you know what  This designer simply stuck by the first viable solution because there was no one there to help him or her explore other options  The designer did his or her best  okayed the product for release  then crossed their fingers   We call this trap premature commitment  It s the common cause of death for new products   You know what that feels like  the moment you finally think of a solution to a difficult problem  It seems perfect in every aspect  so you rush to implement it and move on to the next challenge   How exciting   But the solution probably has hidden flaws  These flaws will likely come to the surface when fixing them will involve an enormous cost  unless you sidestep this pitfall by letting people criticize your ideas early on  Investing in another perspective is worth it when compared to the cost of failure   Product as a new form of life it s born  it grows  it lives   Repeat after us  design is a process  A constant  glorious struggle to make the product better  And better  And better still   Leaving the product as is after launch would be like looking into the watery blue eyes of your newborn child  declaring it has reached its full potential and throwing it to a bunch of random strangers   Good business people won t do this because they re aware that product continuity and product ownership are important  They accept the fact that the devices and technologies through which users interact with their product will change and that their users now and their users in a year might have very different needs and habits   It s fine  We have a way to deal with this constant stream of chaotic change that is the reality   Our secret  Not making a product dependent on the continued engagement of a single person   Designs need to grow with time  Otherwise they become useless relics of the past  People might still pay them some attention as curiosities  but that s not what you want your product to be   You want to solve users  problems  You want to be relevant  So make sure your product has ample room to grow   Who reads summaries  anyway   Key things to take away from this letter   One designer probably doesn t have all the skills necessary to make your product a hit Designers work better in pairs and teams Premature commitment is caused by growing your product in an unfriendly environment that is  under the care of only one designer Design is a process  so let your product live  We re confident you ll apply this knowledge by finding yourself a merry bunch of product designers  so that both you and they can live without the fear of sudden failure   We d wish you luck in all your business ventures  but you don t need any   With love   Lonely product designers  More posts about product design,"[423 142 381 990 426 776

426,training-dataset/business/575.txt,business,Find  Vet and Close the Best Product ManagersTodd Jackson has been a part of product organizations across some of the best companies in the Valley  from Google to Facebook to Twitter  after it acquired his own startup  Cover  Now VP of Product and Design at Dropbox  he s worked with hundreds of product managers   and hired dozens   over the course of his career   When Jackson was at Twitter  the company surveyed its engineering  product and design teams  asking what they thought and knew about each other s areas of expertise  While everyone was clear on what engineers did  write code   and the majority could describe the responsibilities of designers  less than half of respondents knew what product managers actually did  This seemed like something the product team  and Jackson in particular as Director of Product Management  should dig into   Unsurprisingly  it turned out the PMs knew exactly what everyone else did    As he asked more people what they thought PMs did  he realized that everyone had different answers   I think that s because the PM role needs to be purposely flexible  almost by design   he says   A PM basically sits at the center of UX  technology and business  You may have heard the quote   The PM is the CEO of their product   I think that s pretty accurate  but it also means they have to do a lot of diverse things well  and good ones are extremely hard to find    In this interview  Jackson explains how startups can define the type of PMs they need  source candidates  ask the right interview questions   and  perhaps most importantly  convince them to come work for you   WHAT MAKES AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT MANAGER   The best product managers do three things   Articulate what a winning product looks like   Rally the team to build it   Iterate on it until they get it right   Doing this well no matter what you re building or environment you re working in requires a specific set of qualities  Jackson breaks them into three categories  Must Haves  Good To Haves and Bonus Qualities   Outstanding intellectual ability and the ability to synthesize information both help a PM identify what a winning product will look like  and how it will succeed strategically in its market  Excellent communication  leadership and effectiveness within the company culture are required to articulate the vision for that product and get others excited to devote their time and energy   I ve never seen a truly great product manager that did not have all four qualities in the Must Have column   Jackson says   In the Good To Have column  technical background and entrepreneurial spirit will help a PM gain the loyalty and credibility they need to motivate the best work from engineers and designers  Analytical and strategic thinking are necessary for constant  smart iteration  Most well known tech companies like Dropbox will only hire PMs who have both columns A and B covered   The bonus features  like writing code  creating mockups  and running their own analysis is what you might look for in an early hire or on a small team  They ll maximize your productivity per person  At larger companies  you tend to have more people to specialize in these tasks so PMs don t usually need to  It s always nice to have them  They re just more critical at some times than others in a company s life  The extra effort should be made for a first product hire  Jackson says    This definition of what a PM needs to be and have is probably 70  right for most companies   he says   But if you re a SaaS company with a huge sales team  you might have a different archetype in mind than if you re a 40 person social app company   So think about what s core to the success of a PM at your company and then what the more  elective  attributes might be that are tailored to your industry and product in particular  Actually write the list  It makes a big difference to see it laid out visually when you start talking to candidates   FINDING THE RIGHT CANDIDATE  As you search for a PM  you ll get a blend of proactive applicants and referrals  but it s also a good idea to source candidates yourself on LinkedIn  The latter will give you a more refined sense of who s out there with what experience and how that maps to what you need the person in the role to do   While there is no single successful PM archetype  Jackson likes to think there are a handful of PM personas that can work well  All five of the anonymized profiles below are representative of amazing product managers he knows personally  and show the breadth of diverse backgrounds that can make great PMs   It s important to look for diverse experiences and backgrounds   Jackson says   Your users and customers are likely a diverse set of people  so your employees should be too  This can actually be a big competitive advantage over other companies that think too rigidly or homogeneously about their hiring    The Classic Choice  This is the resume with a more conventional PM background   Computer Science undergraduate degree from a school like Georgia Tech  Brown  Rice or University of Illinois   schools with great CS programs  Founded a non profit community summer program in college  Product Manager at a large tech company  worked on advertiser facing products and then video products   I like the range of experience here   says Jackson   Experience working on advertiser and publisher facing products  as well as consumer facing video products around search and discovery  Plus she had the initiative to start a non profit  This is someone you definitely want to talk to    The Rookie Prospect  Robotics undergraduate degree from Olin College  Course Assistant for a History of Technology Class  Product Management Intern at a large tech company   Whenever you re talking to someone who has no full time work experience  it s a very high risk  high reward prospect  So you have to do your best to look for evidence of their capabilities  The number one sign I have here is that they went to Olin College  which some folks might not have heard of  but I know by reputation produces great product managers   says Jackson   The PMs I ve known who went to Olin were all very technical but also creative  Their course assistant work is a touch of the humanities  It s a technical background married with creative user facing experience  Definitely worth a phone call    The Management Consulting Refugee  Psychology degree from Emory  Data Analyst at a startup developing search technology  including web crawling and document processing tools   Senior Business Analyst at a well known consulting firm   You see this profile pretty often these days   people who want to get into tech from consulting or finance   says Jackson   And a lot of them would make great product managers because they have the analytical thinking and strategic mindset  But you have to make sure they have a true passion for technology and solving user needs  Also  are they going to be willing to collaborate effectively with engineers and designers or just provide directives and assume their instructions will be followed  These are the two most common pitfalls I see when hiring people from this background    The ideal version of this profile includes what this sample resume has  some experience working in technology  Technical background is a good indicator of problem solving ability and a desire to build things  But even then  the culture at some consulting shops conditions people to lead through force or command and control methods rather than excitement and influence   When you talk to these candidates  always ask them about how they lead   and you want to hear them to talk about how they lead through example

has  a strong interest in usability and likes direct interaction with users     I love this type of profile because you know if this person actually has the product skills you re looking for  they re going to be great at working with the engineers or designers on the team   says Jackson   If someone s entire experience is in engineering  you want to look for other signs that she is a product thinker  Here it s in the person s summary  but not every engineer will say something like that    In the absence of a clearly stated interest in or experience with product  you want to look for evidence of the person taking on steep learning curves and growing fast  Did she teach herself new programming languages to work on a project  Did he rise swiftly in an organization  Those actions indicate that they re entrepreneurial enough to flexibly shift into a product role   Marketer Biz Dev Turned PM  International Business and Marketing degree  Cal State Poly  Co founder  a startup focused on developing social ads and products  Business and Corporate Development at a large tech company   This one can be challenging because many great marketing and biz dev people can dazzle you   they are really good at talking about tech products  but you have to be careful   Jackson says   Can they really build stuff  Have they built anything in the past    Let s say that while at their last company they led deals where they had to understand technical and product integrations   that would be a positive indicator  Also  as a co founder  this person built and launched products from scratch    You can see that a CS degree isn t always required   he says   But it does help  If they don t have a technical background  then they should have impressive entrepreneurial experience mentioned elsewhere in their past roles    Todd Jackson  Dropbox s VP of Product and Design  THE IDEAL INTERVIEW PROCESS  The typical PM interview has three stages  phone screen or coffee  the one on one in person hiring loop  and the panel presentation   The screening process is mostly about finding mutual fit  If you re hiring for a startup  roughly half the time should be devoted to convincing the person to come in and talk to the rest of the team  The caliber of the people you go after and the fact that your startup is probably unknown means you re mostly in sell mode   When it comes to the one on one hiring loop  who you choose to include from your side depends on the size of your company   Let s say you re at a small startup with less than 100 people  You ll want the top PM candidates to speak to your founders  the other PMs on the team  if any   your engineering lead  a design lead  and a business lead   If you re at a large company with more than 500 people  let s say  the rules change  You want these candidates to talk to your VP Product  two to three other PMs on the team  the engineering lead  design lead and business lead   These are the stakeholders that will probably interact with the person on a daily basis  and they ll illuminate different aspects of their experience and personality  In all of these conversations  the goal should be to see how well the person fits this list of criteria   Intellectual ability  Communication  Leadership  Effectiveness within the company culture  Knows what users want  Strategic Analytical Thinking  Technical background  Entrepreneurial spirit  Below  Jackson lists some of the questions he s found to be the most valuable when interviewing product management candidates in person  what he believes good answers sound like  and the responses that should give you pause   QUESTION 1  Product Sense   Name a product that you think is exceptionally well designed   ideally a non electronic product  Tell me what makes it well designed   Testing intellectual ability  communication  and whether they know what customers want    WEAK ANSWER  Something superficial or clich    If they don t go into a lot of detail and say something fluffy like   My electric toothbrush is so great  it s won a bunch of design awards   that s a strike against them    GOOD ANSWER  First  the candidate will get excited to talk about a product they admire  and it will show   One of the best answers I heard was about the Micro Kickboard scooter for kids   I remember the candidate getting really excited telling me all the details   I recently noticed how thoughtfully designed my niece s scooter is  It s the mini scooter that you see a lot of kids riding lately  It s got two big polyurethane wheels in front and a third small one in the back  so it goes over cracks and bumps smoothly and prevents faceplants  Also  instead of handlebars that turn  it has a  lean to steer  design which is really intuitive for kids  teaching them how to steer by shifting their weight  And it s also just super easy to assemble and disassemble basically just two parts that click together     Particularly strong candidates will look at the product from the user s perspective and talk about the problem it solves  In the above example   the candidate spoke about how the users of the product  kids  are actually different than the customers of the product  parents  and all the product design and marketing ramifications of that  which I though was quite insightful   The candidate will have a lot to say and will be very enthusiastic as they speak  especially about the very small details that provide a finished and delightful experience   That s how you know the difference between a passionate product person and someone who just wants a job    To take it up a notch  you can follow up with the question   What would you improve about it   or  If you were the CEO of the company that produced this product  and you wanted to sell 10X as many  what would you do   Look for educated guesses or reasonable assumptions about the market for the product  who the target buyer is  how the market could expand  the constraints of production  etc  Those are the components that should drive the next best step for the product  it shouldn t just be a random idea   Note  It can be easy for PM candidates to prepare for this question  You can make sure they re thinking on their feet by constraining the space they choose from  For instance  the example must be a physical or non electronic product or one they have at home   QUESTION 2  Technical Skill   In as much detail as possible  tell me what happens when I type yahoo com into my browser and hit enter   Testing intellectual ability  communication skills and technical background    WEAK ANSWER  Their response might be rudimentary or confused  You could get an answer like   I see the Yahoo homepage  right    GOOD ANSWER  Something like   Your browser generates an HTTP request  A DNS lookup gets the IP address of the host  The server receives the request  checks for cookies to see if you re logged in  and eventually generates an HTTP response containing the content you should see  Your browser receives the response  parses the DOM and starts to render the page  CSS  images and Javascript are loaded to modify the page    The strongest candidates can answer this question in good detail  taking about five minutes to walk you through the process  This is a good level setting question for product managers so you can see where they stand technically  They don t have to hit every single action that happens  Watch out especially for candidates who say they ve programmed in the last few years but are clueless about this question  That s definitely a red flag   If you think that candidates may have prepared for this type of question  you can mix it up by drilling them on specifics at various junctures of their response  Or you can ask them similar questions about the fundamentals of iOS or Android programming if they have a lot of mobile experience   QUESTION 3  Leadership   Tell me about a time when you disagreed with engineers and designers on your team  What did you do   Tests communication  leadership and effectiveness within the company culture   WEAK ANSWER  There will be allusion to finger pointing  or mention of blame  The tone of their response will be generally negative  and you might see a dip in self awareness  complemented by a spike in defensiveness  They ll be more concerned with smoothing over their role in the confrontation than sticking to the facts   GOOD ANSWER  They ll demonstrate leadership by diagnosing root causes of the conflict  They ll show humility   One candidate told me she couldn t agree with her engineering and design team on one feature   they all wanted to build it and she didn t  She said   Okay let s time bound it  We ll do the idea  but if it doesn t pay off in four weeks  we re going to change it to this other idea   I thought that was a great solution to avoid gridlock   The candidate knew when to push back and when to disagree and commit   A candidate who ends their response by saying what they learned from the situation and how they applied these lessons going forward should get serious bonus points   QUESTION 4  What are all the implications of self driving cars   Tests strategic and analytical thinking and entrepreneurial spirit    WEAK ANSWER  A response that is boring  cursory  or disorganized  They might throw out some obvious answers  like unemployment for taxi drivers  or self driving big rigs  But they won t go deeper into the ripple effects in other industries that will create a whole new wave of businesses  They ll stay in the inner ring of cause and effect   GOOD ANSWER  Showing vision and imagination  they ll paint you a picture of what could happen  Maybe car seats will be arranged in a circle around a coffee table  No one will own cars anymore  which means no one will have garages anymore   I got an amazing answer to this one the other day   Google will open source the software for self driving cars so that any manufacturer can build them  the way they offer Android    says Jackson   I have no idea if that will be true or not  but I thought it was pretty creative    Most importantly  the answer should come packaged in some sort of organizational framework  Maybe they ll say how life will change for drivers  and then the auto industry  and then urban planning  Ideas should be presented within themes  not as a free association jumble   QUESTION 5  What aspect of product management do you find the least interesting   WEAK ANSWER  A PM who complains about doing nitty gritty work  e g  taking notes  scheduling meetings  and implies that these things are beneath them   GOOD ANSWER  A great PM understands that they need to lead from the back  and they relish their role as an unsung hero  The candidate doesn t have to say they love the tough nitty gritty stuff  but they should get points for acknowledging the grungy parts of PM work and why it s important to be in service to the team and mission their supporting   QUESTION 6  Why do you want to work at this company or on this product   WEAK ANSWER   X industry company is getting a lot of buzz  Everyone is talking about it  It s really hot right now    GOOD ANSWER  Clearly passionate about the industry  company or project  Look for specific ideas and plans for what they d want to do and how they want to make things better  This indicates that they really did their homework and have thought deeply about the company  In particular  keep your eyes peeled for long term thinking  which indicates commitment to the industry or type of product  For example  is the person talking about what robots or drones will look like in 5 or 10 years  Or do they just talk about how robots and drones are exciting now  Here are some examples   I ve always wanted to work in X industry  I ve done Y and Z in the last couple years to really prepare for this career move   Company X has a huge competitive advantage because of Y   I have been using product X for a while  and I really like feature Y  I think feature Z could really improve growth engagement monetization and here s why     You want people who are excited about the space  not just this one opportunity   Panel Presentation  After a candidate has made it through all the one on one interviews  you should stop and evaluate  You have the chance to save everyone a ton of time if they re not a good match  So make sure that it s a good fit on both sides  and that everyone s equally excited  before proceeding to the next phase of the process  The panel presentation    I like to ask candidates to come and give a presentation in the office around a conference table for 8 to 10 people   says Jackson   This is a good way to see how they do in a group dynamic  how they present their ideas  and how clearly they express themselves    The prompt he gives them is pretty complex   PART 1  What product or service has launched in the past two years that you believe is particularly revolutionary  What does this product improve for its customers  What about it is well designed  How will the product impact market conditions and the competitive climate in its industry   PART 2  Identify three areas of the product that could be improved  Explain how you would change the product to address these issues and how you d test whether these changes had a positive impact   Candidates are asked to present for an hour with 15 20 slides    I ve seen some really great presentations   says Jackson   A really memorable one was about Class Dojo  which is educational software  The candidate actually set up the environment like a Class Dojo classroom so all the people on the panel got gold stars when we asked good questions  It was really entertaining and interactive  But really you re looking to see how deep the person goes in their thinking  How fluidly do they communicate  Presentation matters  Most importantly  how do they deal with Q A on the spot  because PMs have to be able to handle a constant flow of hard questions    Bottom line  You want PMs who are spokespeople  They have to be able to represent themselves  their work and the work of their teams every day  Their job will be good communication  They have to be clear  organized in their thinking  and quick on their feet   CLOSING THE CANDIDATE  Once you have a candidate you love  it can be tragic to lose them  The close is like a gymnast sticking their landing  It s really what matters in the end  Ironically  the close process starts at the very beginning of your interaction with a person   First and foremost  You need to over communicate and remain in frequent contact with all candidates  They should never feel confused or unsure of where they stand  Be hands on  Don t delegate this to recruiters  Stay involved and available  There s nothing more damaging to candidate experience than someone feeling like your company doesn t care about them   This seems obvious  but there are a few closing tricks that are specific to PMs    I like to think about the reward centers in the PM brain   says Jackson   There s several big ones I can think of  having impact  delighting users  sense of purpose mission  having autonomy  getting recognition  financial outcomes  learning growth  etc  In my experience  more than other disciplines  PMs tend to care most about impact and autonomy    This is unique  Engineers are often motivated by really interesting technical challenges  Designers can be motivated by craftsmanship and feeling of community  Of the reward centers that are important to PMs  one will stand out more for a candidate  It s different for everyone  but you want to figure out what that one  most influential factor is  You can even ask a candidate to stack rank them in order of importance   Once you know what drives them  describe in detail how that will manifest in their role at your company  For example  if autonomy is most important  talk about the opportunities they will have to lead projects on their own  If user delight is most important  talk about past releases that have gotten enthusiastic reception  If impact is most important  talk about how what they ll be doing rolls up to move the needle on a company wide objective    If you can honestly describe to them how they ll get the reward they want most  you ll close some great candidates   says Jackson   Just make sure you deliver on whatever you promised  The only thing more important than hiring the best PMs is keeping them,"[776 426 471 802 1116 46 170 423 24 1092 340]"
433,training-dataset/product/759.txt,product,Measuring KPIs for a Platform vs a Revenue Generating Product44 Flares 44 Flares    There are some important differences between managing a solutions vs a platform product  in terms of providing product value  I wrote about becoming a platform Product Manager recently for Mind the Product   One of the key differences is how you determine and track valuable key performance indicators  KPIs    What are KPIs and how do you Choose Them   This post focuses on the differences for managing KPIs not just for platforms overall  but for content management systems   products used by web sites to build their content  which include the tools that editors use to publish content to the site   There are lots and lots of helpful articles on what KPIs are  and how to best determine which KPIs are best for your business  including this one  this one  and this one   So here is just a quick overview of what KPIs are and how you can go about choosing them   What are KPIs   KPIs are a set of measurements meant to indicate whether or not a product is successful   How do you Choose KPIs   Because so many other articles have written on this subject  this is a quick  oversimplified  plan for one way you could go about choosing KPIs from your product   This plan borrows ideas from the product innovation model used by Netflix  see its blog post here  and many other product companies to quickly determine success for product innovations   Remember  once you choose your KPIs  you should stick with them for a while  This could be a good way to at least get you started    Plan   Start with your goals  Don t try to paste another product s goals onto your product  Your product and business is unique  Come up with a hypothesis for what metrics might allow you to prove that you re delivering value  according to your goals  Brainstorm ways to cheaply implement a test for whether or not the metrics you chose will consistently test for value  Repeat the test until you find metrics that work for your product  Remember  measure metrics that reliably reveal cause and effect  See more on this important point here  Measure only the most important things  Keep the list small  try three items per category   Once you ve found metrics that reliably test whether your product is providing value  track those metrics over time to see if your product efforts improve  or maintain  success  Re check every so often that your KPIs are still the right indicators of your product s success   KPIs for Solutions Products vs Platform Products  Okay  That s done  Moving onto the differences between solutions products and platform CMS KPIs   Because a  solutions  product is something you sell and a platform is common infrastructure that you build products on  their goals and therefore the ways they define success are  naturally  pretty different   For instance  solutions products often focus on revenue growth and customer growth as key drivers of product success  so they are measured via KPIs such as increased MRR  monthly recurring revenue added in a given month  or the rate at which prospects are converted to customers  See more metrics ideas and suggestions here   Platform CMS products are not usually directly involved in generating revenue  so many of the KPIs that solutions product managers might measure are not relevant  That  however  does not mean that platform or CMS products do not have an impact on a business s bottom line   So what are some good KPIs for a CMS product manager to think about  For our product  we break our goals into four categories  financial goals  systems goals  user  customer  goals  and innovation goals   Financial Goals  Because I work for a media company with thousands of editors producing content for websites  one of the goals of the CMS is to drive efficient production or publication of the words  images  videos  and other media that make up the site s content   Some KPIs for increasing efficiency of content production include   Percentage decrease in time to publish  Reduction in cost  in employee hours  to program pages  Reduction in cost  in employee hours  maintaining pages and doors  Increased number of new published content items per week   month  Also  CMSes  particularly enterprise CMses  are often implemented to save costs   i e  in order to not have to pay vendors to handle tasks the company can handle on its own  and to drive efficiency   A simple way to test whether the CMS is saving costs is to determine the cost of a hosted solution vs the cost of the staff and third party services  Of course  this cost must also be set against the opportunity cost of allowing for greater custom innovation  see below    Reporting these KPIs to stakeholders who are funding the CMS  or other enterprise platform  keeps them up to date on the value of their financial investment   Systems Goals  Much of what matters to the users of the CMS and to the business depends on the efficiency of the platform   A CMS product team must work with the engineering management team to quantify data quality  integration efficiency  infrastructure reliability  and other systems related concerns   To drive efficiency  a CMS product manager may work with an engineering manager to determine the metrics such as the following for the following categories   Data quality Percentage decrease in reported bugs Percentage increase in specific types of log errors  Release efficiency Decrease in number of bugs created in QA or after release Decrease in integration costs  in engineering hours  spent on releases  Reliability Percentage decrease of time outages occur Percentage decrease in MTBF  mean time between failures  Percentage decrease in MTTR  mean time to repair     i e  consider which failures matter most to users and stakeholders and measure how often they happen  and how long they take to be repaired    Working with engineering management to determine and report on KPIs is a vital piece of a CMS or platform product manager s role   Innovation Goals  Another key reason to use an enterprise CMS is to create custom solutions to support innovative content   To measure whether or not a CMS is enabling greater innovation  the product management team can measure the percentage increase in the revenues from custom features vs  the cost of producing the feature   Also  if the goal is that the CMS allows readers on the end site to experience more innovative content  this article suggests that product managers can  measure reader s attitude to published content    i e  intentionally track reader sentiment or behavior related to custom features enabled by the CMS   User  Customer  Goals  As Jody Roberts says  we  can t talk about measuring the success of a CMS  without talking about measuring the success of that CMS  consumers   As with all products  the users of that product should be satisfied  or more  with the product  CMS product managers can use simple surveys to measure customer temperature tests over time  are they unhappy  neutral  happy  or very happy with your product   Then  of course there s the handy Net Promoter Score  Even in the context of an internal CMS  product managers can ask users whether they d recommend the CMS to new employees  or would encourage the business to continue funding the product    Conclusion  Though the definition of success might be different for solutions vs platform products  a CMS  like any product  needs to provide value for its users  customers  and the business  and be measured against metrics that prove its value   To do so  a product manager must understand their goals  work with their engineering counterparts and stakeholders to determine the right KPIs to track those goals  and then continually review whether or not the KPIs are really enabling them to report valuable insight on the success of the product   Whether your platform goals are to increase efficiency  increase data quality  or delight users  it s key to think of KPIs that will track and show value for your unique product,"[433 1149 121 381 692 605 140 984 409 688 66]"

465,training-dataset/product/247.txt,product,Universal Studios vs  DisneylandWho doesn t love Disneyland  besides parents  mid twenties  seniors  people who hate waiting in line   But then why again do we always say  I m going to Disneyland  after you accomplish something  win a Superbowl championship  which I ve obviously done  or anything else of magnitude  One of the various reasons is their product management  Disney has a wonderful product and they know how to manage it  and manage themselves well   Universal Studios is one of their main competitors and for good reason  Universal is also in the entertainment industry  and not only do they produce movies but there is also a Universal Studios theme park in Hollywood  Miami and Singapore  While Disney may be the original  Universal Studios has become serious competition  which is due to how they have changed their product and their marketing   As a product manager I started noticing that Universal was starting to do something right  More and more of my friends were going to Universal Studios theme parks instead of Disneyland  I think there are several reasons for this   Know Your Target  Universal understands that their product is different than Disney s  Universal markets for teenagers  parents with older kids  and the generally older crowd  while Disney has its target base as children  kids that are growing up with their cartoons  animated movies and television shows  This is what a product manager should know  You need to know what your target is  because if you don t you re in trouble  Your product is specifically designed for a target group   Don t Worry About It  Don t worry about other similar products if they are targeting a different group  while on the same note  if you have heavy competition within the product market you re launching then maybe you should target a different audience  Many theme parks tend to be pretty close to each other and there s a reason for it  Putting Universal next to Disneyland increases both their chances of customers  Universal knows that maybe people will be on their way to Disneyland and decide to come to Universal  because after all  their product targets a different audience  They don t stress about Disney s theme park being near them  rather they embrace it   Stay Relevant  You know when Facebook decides to update their  wall  and their user interface and it just drives people crazy  Do it  I know  I know  As the saying goes  If it isn t broken  don t fix it  but frankly I just don t believe in it  You need to keep your product fresh  more importantly you need to stay relevant and you also need to have people stay interested in you  Every time  but honestly every time  that Facebook changes their layout  people talk about it  and that s important  Universal did the same thing with their Harry Potter World  Something that wasn t necessarily a part of the Universal brand in the beginning  has now become an essential part of the Universal Studios Orlando experience   As a product manager  you need to remember the products you have already produced and made ready and remember to update them if possible  If your product isn t necessarily a technical product it doesn t matter  Products can remain relevant as long as they are rebranded and made relevant to today   No matter where you look you can always learn a little bit about product management  even when you re waiting in line for a ride  watching animated characters come to life  and enjoying time with the family  Just don t forget to enjoy other peoples products as well,"[465 605 381 379 121 356 24 1032 46 1102 1365]"

469,training-dataset/product/593.txt,product,Can Product Squads Improve Your Agile Development Process Squads are a relatively new methodology for product development popularized by Spotify  Actually  popularized might be too strong a term for it  Since 2012  when Spotify restructured its development organization into functional  eight person squads   developers and a product owner   much has been written about this novel approach  But it seems few organizations have actually adopted it   There are several legitimate reasons why a product squad structure might not make sense for your organization  I ll discuss those below  along with the reasons it might indeed be a way to improve your product development   But first  let s take a step back to discuss how we got here  How and why has the process of product management and development evolved   From Waterfall to Agile to Squads  or Maybe Not   Waterfall is a very linear approach to creating products  Much of the work is done upfront  with product managers working in a clear sequence of steps  First  they plan  design and document essentially everything they can think of with regard to what will be needed for their product s development  When that is complete  they hand off this documentation to their developers for execution   And although it is still popular in some larger software organizations   primarily because it allows for strict deadlines and managerial controls   waterfall has several drawbacks   In many software organizations  waterfall product development has given way to agile   The agile development methodology emphasizes people over processes  and communication and testing over documentation  As the agile thinking goes  let s be collaborative and quick  And let s let the market itself tell us whether or not we re succeeding   rather than simply deciding we ve executed successfully because we faithfully stayed on track with our product roadmap   That s where the concept of product squads comes in   In a way  Spotify s squad approach is the next logical step in further streamlining the agile method   The way Spotify has set them up  each of these squads consists of a small team of developers and one product owner   usually  but not necessarily  a product manager  What makes these squads unique  A few things   First  squads are responsible for functional areas of the company s product line  they do not work across entire products or on ad hoc projects assigned by management  For example  one squad might focus on exclusively search technology  This allows the company to develop significant expertise and intellectual capital across each functional area of its offering  In other words  it can build teams of true industry experts  rather than a single large team of coding generalists   The second way squads deviate from traditional product development approaches is that they are given real autonomy  In fact  Spotify thinks of its squads as independent startups   What does that mean in practical terms  It means that a squad can select its own areas of functional responsibility to work on  Once it has taken on such an area   again  search technology  for example   it can update the production version of its product anytime  It can push work out to users without waiting for approvals from anyone outside the squad   So the basic idea is that product squads can lead to much more efficient product development  teams who are highly knowledgeable about the product s various functional areas  faster development cycles  and ultimately more successful products   Is the product squad approach right for your organization  It depends  There are benefits and drawbacks  and it isn t a clear fit for every organizational culture  Keep reading to get an understanding of whether or not it could work for you   Two Reasons the Squad Method Might Improve Your Product Development  1  It can generate true in house expertise   The product owner in a squad has a much greater ability to learn about his functional area than he would if he were responsible for an entire product  Sticking with search as our example  a product owner at Spotify can become an unrivaled expert on the technology   how search can be used to improve the overall user experience  best practices  and all of the latest industry improvements   If that product owner were responsible for the entire product  however  he would only be able to spend so much time on search   or anything else for that matter  He would also have equal responsibility for learning about partner channels  pricing models  securing music contracts  researching the latest developments on UX  and on and on   By assigning squads to complementary areas of functional responsibility across your product line  you can allow for tremendous knowledge among both your product owners and developers  In fact  this can be a key differentiator for your company  because your competitors will likely still be developing in the everyone works on everything model   2  It can speed everything  development  feedback and learning  and updates   Because squads are permanent  small teams  its members get to know each other well  developing a chemistry and a team shorthand that can speed the work   Also  because the squad has the authority to release its product updates directly to the market anytime it wants  it can more quickly learn what s working and what isn t  It can then autonomously make improvements and push right back out to its user base   The squad approach can in some cases be a perfect addition to an agile environment because it supports one of the most important agile principles    Working software is the primary measure of progress    The more quickly your squads are able to update the product and push those updates to market  the more quickly they ll be able to determine if they re working or how they can be further improved  Ultimately  that will generally lead to a more successful product   Three Reasons the Squad Method Might Undermine Your Product Development  But your organization might  for several reasons  not benefit from adopting the squad approach  In fact  for many types of companies this method can even harm your development efforts  Here s how   1  Your product line might not support this model   Remember  the product squad approach was developed  or at least popularized  by Spotify   a SaaS company  They obviously coded their product in a framework that allows for tinkering and tweaking here and there without negatively affecting any other parts of the product   Because their code is segmented to such an extent that they can modify the radio functionality without touching their search code  for example  the squad method of autonomous team updates makes perfect sense for Spotify   What if you sell multiple interrelated products and services  and they were constructed such that an update to one area of a product might affect everything else   You probably wouldn t want to restructure your development and product management organizations into squads  because you couldn t give those small groups the autonomy to update the live products  Otherwise their updates could jeopardize the stability of the rest of the product   Additionally  if your product has many components with interdependencies  you would often have instances where one squad had to wait for support from another squad  And this would remove much of the value of operating under a squad model in the first place   2  You risk breaking your in house product knowledge into silos   In an agile context  a product manager s primary role is to educate the developers on the product s personas and the problems the product should solve for those personas  In other words  product managers should have a comprehensive understanding of the product as a whole   But if you break your resources into squads responsible for functional areas  you are in effect dicing up the overall  strategic level product knowledge across several product owners  Although they might become unrivaled experts in their functional areas  these product owners likely won t have a full strategic understanding of the entire product  That s risky   Additionally  by making your developers hyper specialists in a few functional areas  without also allowing them to work at times on other projects  you risk isolating your company s coding talent from the big picture view of the product   So if your squads don t interconnect well and often  then you run the risk of information silos  Who at your organization will have full product knowledge  Which product managers  Which developers  Will any of them   3  You could lose some of the advocacy from both product management and development   A third reason squads might not work is that a product s success often depends on maintaining some distance and objectivity between product management and development  The product owner should be focusing on product vision  strategy  the what  They should then be communicating this to development  who should focus on the how   So it s not necessarily a bad approach to have a little tension between product management and development  Product managers should be looking to push boundaries  try new things  and implement themes that might not be so easy for development   Developers will be motivated to complete the challenges put before them as efficiently and quickly as possible  But the product manager will at times have strategic reasons for wanting to execute on an initiative in a given way   one that might be at odds with the development team s way of thinking   But if the product manager is on the same team as the developers  you run the risk that she won t ask for X because she knows that within her team s functional area of responsibility  the framework will make it easier to implement Y instead   Think of the embedded journalist problem  When war correspondents embed themselves with a military detachment and go out on missions under their protection  you can imagine how difficult it can be for those journalists to then report the facts objectively  particularly if their report would portray the military team unfavorably   The same potential problem exists with embedding a product manager on a development team   The product will likely enjoy more success when both product managers and developers are advocating strongly in favor of what they see as best for the product   even if doing so creates a bit of tension between both teams   Product Squads  Interesting Approach to Product Development  But Not Right for Everyone  Product squads seem to be a great way to build strong  knowledgeable development teams   They also offer perhaps the best development framework yet to allow companies to quickly and efficiently build and release products  and then improve upon them based on how their markets react   Moreover  they seem to be a logical extension of the agile philosophy  Indeed  one of the more important agile principles is   The best architectures  requirements  and designs emerge from self organizing teams    And remember  agile development itself is all about doing what works best rather than adhering to any process or development rule   If the product squad approach sounds like a fit for your organization  it might be worth a try   But if you re not sure to what degree your product can handle independent updates at various times  or you worry about sacrificing overall product knowledge to build up your organization s functional expertise  then you might want to investigate the squad method more deeply first  Implementing the wrong product development strategy can create more problems than it solves,"[469 192 302 1329 356 381 1287 24 1365 98 605]"
471,training-dataset/product/1086.txt,product,The 10 most important hiring questions for Product Managers The 10 most important hiring questions for Product Managers   Arghhh  good Product Managers are hard to find in Europe  UK included   A good PM can bring back customer focus and efficiency in the development process but I ve a higher chance of hiring a bad one and my engineers may hate me forever   I started my career as a product designer and advanced pretty quickly into product management  I ve always loved the technical challenges of engineering but didn t have the abstract mindset to be good at writing code in the text editor  I like mapping and solving problems  I have a strong sense of purpose and collaboration  I love to move from the strategy to the technical details  so I naturally gravitated into product management   Applying the framework used to hire Designers for PMs has been working decently so far  It is not perfect but I m constantly improving it from the lessons I ve learnt from interviewing any PM   Last week a good friend asked for some help in hiring a PM   I cannot find any decent test to validate if a Product Manager is really good at his job  How can I be 100  sure I m in front of a good candidate  How do I know this is the right one for my team   The simple answer is that you cannot because there is no code repository or design portfolio to look at  and previous successes are not necessary a differentiator   There is no infallible way to build hit products  just as there is no infallible way to check if the PM has the right skills to succeed in the mission   In the long run a good PM makes the difference between a winning or losing product but in the short term ask yourself   Why do I need a Product Manager   The need for product management is difficult to perceive and common objections to it include the fact that you don t want to relinquish control of your product until you are too busy making major corporate decisions   A PM is expendable and anyone can somehow fill the gap  it is a job that companies can get along fine without   I need engineers to build   I need salespeople to sell   I need visual designers to draw     I rarely feel the need for a PM   Forget about PM weakness and start focusing on the strengths   PM isn t a domain specific job and the candidate doesn t always need experience in this sector   Experience in the same industry rarely matters  in fact the correlation with past experience and future success is very rare   The technology continues to change at a rapidly increasing rate and knowledge is less important than ability to learn fast   The role is different at every company and is unique to each specific company  I ve seen tons of definitions for what a PM is  what they do and who they report into   Do I need a PM with previous developer background  Ultimately  Google requires it   A PM doesn t need to be a former developer  Technical knowledge definitely helps to initiate conversation and raise the respect of engineers but they don t need to take the final technical decision  There is the risk of commoditising features if you are hiring a PM driven by technology    We ll use technology to produce commodities and we ll make experiences in order to avoid becoming a commodity ourselves   The Inevitable  Kevin Kelly  Patterns and heuristics to look into when hiring a PM    We start with the customer and we work backward  Amazon mantra  I love to write lists  here s the ultimate set of skills I m looking for in a good PM   Customer driven mindset  Rationale  there is a product because customers use it   Rationale  there is a product because customers use it  Inquisitive  curious  resilient and highly adaptable  The context is always changing and the ultimate goal is to survive  In order to do this the PM must quickly change approach when data indicates the reality is contrary to a hypothesis   The context is always changing and the ultimate goal is to survive  In order to do this the PM must quickly change approach when data indicates the reality is contrary to a hypothesis  Passionate and able to distill complex problems into distinct technical components  A good product comes from collaborative efforts   A good product comes from collaborative efforts  Focuses on the process and constantly explores better ways to build products  There is not only one way to do things right   There is not only one way to do things right  Able to use research and data  Data has the power to make things tangible  it empowers teams to deliver success   The PM in action  The 10 questions to see the PM solving real problems   The default approach is to focus the interview on the PM s ability to articulate what they have done in the past or what they would do differently if they could do it again   This is the standard way to start a conversation  but what excites me more is to evaluate a PM s skills by looking at the PM in action  articulating narratives across design  analytical and leadership subjects   Product Design Skill  Because design is the main differentiator in a tech company  a good PM understands the principles of design and knows how to deliver a winning product in any category   1st Question  How would you redesign the salt and pepper dispensers   Designing an everyday object is the way to understand how the PM identifies and verifies customer problems and potential solutions  A good PM uses design thinking  prototyping  mapping models  evaluating affordances and feedback   2nd Question  Tell me about a product you like and use frequently  e g  gmail   Why do you like it   A good PM analyses the product in detail  using lateral thinking to highlight possible problems  They don t jump to conclusions because they are aware of what it takes to deliver a successful product   3rd Question  Choose something you are passionate about  Can you create an application in real time on the whiteboard   A good PM starts by representing the problem and making assumptions  defining a general solution and then entering into the prioritisation process  highlighting the solutions that make the bigger impact   Analytical   Cognitive Skills  A good PM has critical thinking skills and needs to apply their intellectual horsepower in the context of common business problems   4th Question  What is the total annual revenue of the London underground   The good PM is able to quickly make assumptions and generate back of envelope estimates  Hypothetical market sizing is one of the most common ways of assessing this skill   5th Question  Choose a product  e g  Medium   Can you talk about the business model behind it and the metrics its company would track   The good PM is able to reverse engineer a product into the business model canvas  They capture the market and value proposition  they state the product pillars with richness of detail and validate the product market fit   Leadership Skills  Lead great engineers  make tough calls  handle conflicts  to succeed  the PM needs great interpersonal skills and strong discipline   6th Question  Can you tell me about a time when you had to say no to a stakeholder  customer  engineer  designer or sales person   A good PM can influence stakeholders and earn their respect and trust  The good PM embraces collaboration  they know good ideas can come from anyone but at the same time they have clear goals and communicate clearly and explicitly when an idea is not inline with the goal  Do they stand by their opinion or do they quickly back down   7th Question  How much more productive is a great engineer versus average engineer   A good PM highly values and respects engineers  they have worked with great teams and thinks of engineering bandwidth as the most valuable resource on the planet  A great engineer is 10 times more productive than an average one   A good PM refines the product development process so that the engineering team has everything they need to build the product as efficiently as possible  This means that required documentation is done in advance  concepts are validated with prototypes or other low impact tests prior to investing time in full builds  the real data and assets needed are prepared prior to the development team needing them  You won t always achieve this level of preparedness  especially if working in an agile process  but the bar should remain high   8th Question  What did you do that made it easier for the sales team to sell the product   A good PM understands what it takes to sell products and can work effectively with the sales team  Good PMs are loved by the salesforce  A good PM will be known personally or by reputation by at least half the salesforce  Good PMs know that salespeople have a choice of products to sell and  at a higher level  companies to work for  and selling a particular product is optional  Good PMs know that if the sales force doesn t like the product  they will fail  Good PMs understand that salespeople are under a lot of pressure to meet their monthly target and that s about it   9th Question  Based on your company org chart  who do you want to work with    No matter how smart you are  to be successful you need a team of great people   Steve Jobs  People need recognition  The good PM empowers others to maintain strong ownership  A good PM pushes engineers and designers to show off their work  has feedback systems in place to receive feature suggestions and ideas from anyone   It is very common that PMs have tonnes of responsibilities and no authority   A good PM must provide leadership  advocacy and support to the executive team and any other stakeholders in the company  The good PM leverages the entire organisation and uses whatever intensity is required to close conflicts and critical issues   10th Question  Can you recommend any good product managers to me   A good PM is always trying to learn and improve because they assume that the answers lie outside their own brain  and are open to criticism of their ideas  The good PM has mentors and a list of inspiring people  they demonstrate humility and recognise value in other people  It is an absolute no when a PM suffers the syndrome of Dunning Kruger and is unable to recognise value in others   Most importantly  try to find some time to read

487,training-dataset/product/591.txt,product,How Tough Product Managers Pick FightsHow many times do people  ping  you at work each day  For product managers  the answer is probably something like   Oh  I ve stopped counting   Feedback comes in from so many different channels   internally and externally   that those pings can start to feel like a series of jabs   Of course input from teams across the business is important   even essential   for building a great product that customers love  But ultimately  one person has to own the plan and the direction of the product roadmap   Visionary product managers build brilliant products because they are adept at cutting through the noise to fight for what they know is right  And how do they know what s right  Strategy guides them   Yet it can be tough for product managers to maintain that  true north  perspective when navigating a cacophony of opinions  interests  and needs   from internal teams  partners  and customers   As a former product manager  I know this well  And as the co founder and CEO of Aha   I speak with hundreds of product managers each month who are often struggling to corral the contradictory feedback and requests from different teams   Many product managers have another contender in the ring  You know  that person who makes sure their voice is the loudest and that their projects move ahead  Often these people are found in sales  but I once knew one who came from operations  They can lurk anywhere   Strong product managers push back   hard   against voices that derail  no matter where they come from  That s part of the responsibility that comes with leading a product   Here are five tactics that can help you fight those product battles   without damaging yourself or the team in the process   Tie work to strategy  Taking a goal first approach reduces the likelihood that you will not be able to explain why you are doing something  or not doing something else   When you can demonstrate that decisions are informed by strategy   not a gut feeling or internal politicking   you will find stronger footing in your argument   Avoid surprises  It s your job to share information and keep cross functional teams informed  Schedule consistent status meetings across teams to eradicate back channeling  Set an example   be open with the team and demand the same level of transparency from everyone you work with   Maintain objectivity  Everyone has their pet feature or the new idea they think is worth pursuing  Staying objective will help you fight for what truly matters  Create an objective metric  like a feature scorecard  so that you show feature A and feature B are measured by the same standard  that ideally ties back to your strategic initiatives    Be direct  but respectful   Innovation does not happen when you toe step around people s feelings  But it also does not mean you bulldoze over colleagues  Be firm  direct  and   most important   listen and be kind   Know when to fight  Before you go out swinging  weigh today s battle against the long term vision  Learn to identify the things that are truly worth fighting for and save your time for those  Don t exhaust yourself quibbling over every suggestion   There will be days when it feels like the never ending product battles are beating you down  But do not fret  stand firm on the foundation of your strategy and stand tall   you are fighting for your customers and what is right   Besides  emotion is a good thing  It means you care about what you are building and will not settle for anything less than the best   Developing the skills needed to effectively wield a visionary fighting spirit takes time  Make strategy your guiding star  share the  why  behind your decisions  and treat everyone with respect   even if it means picking the occasional fight   What product decisions have you had to fight for,"[487 1032 1116 9 381 98 1365 692 605 302 1131]"
504,training-dataset/product/865.txt,product,The Product Renaissance  Steven Sinofsky and Suhail Doshi in conversationLast night  Andreessen Horowitz board partner and former president of Microsoft s Windows division Steven Sinofsky joined Mixpanel CEO Suhail Doshi at Mixpanel s Office Hours to discuss the renaissance going on in product right now   Suhail and Steven discussed which skills have remained essential to product management  how the industries of old should adapt to product management  and how product managers should adapt to the established institutions   Here is a list of some key insights from the evening   Of course  it s better to get it straight from the experts  so we re re broadcasting the whole talk on Thursday  February 2 sign up to watch here        1  Software is still eating the world  Steven started the evening by echoing the words of a16z founding member Marc Andreessen  Software is eating the world  Since the dawn of industry  people have been building products  whether they ve been called that or not  But with that newer distinction  product managers have come to the forefront and data is coming along with them  Steven said      Everything that gets made has some sort of notion of a product manager  even if they didn t always call it that  Now  everything that s made is software or has software  Everyone I talk to  Even if they make hardware  Their competitive differentiation is product management for software  In order to be a relevant company today  you re building technology  but fundamentally what you re doing is making products  What s going to happen is you have to make the right products    2  Product management   part science  part art  Suhail said that there s room for intuition in building products  so long as you know when to let data drive you  Great product managers know when to lean on intuition vs  data  And when it s that latter category  PMs should welcome data as a substitute for intuition the process of experimentation is rewarding in its own right  Suhail said    Product is one part science  one part art  When you think about your v1  information is limited  So  you probably have to figure out which way to go on your own  But as PMs  it s really important to iterate  iterate  iterate  If you don t have Steve Jobs like intuition  you know product is a science  and it s about iterating  The other benefit of metrics  It s actually really cool to figure out whether you re right  There are few fields where you do your job  guess  and then actually know whether you re right or not    3  People have done this forever with less  and facts beat opinion  There was a time when people made products without data  and it didn t really work  At Windows  Steven and his team hacked together a way to collect data at scale  even though it was incredibly laborious  Even in the pre internet era  though  it was a powerful experience to witness data  Steven said    When we were building the first release of Microsoft Office  before the internet there was a time   we built a word processor ourselves  But we were a bunch of programmers who didn t write books  so we decided which features to put in  based on our limited experience  The way we solved our problems was with arguing we called it testosterone based engineering      Then  some brilliant people on the team decided to make a special version of Word that had instrumentation in it  There being no internet  we had to sign up volunteers  and then we would put the special version on a bunch of floppy disks and mail it  The volunteers would install  and then we would have to get on a plane and visit the computer that had version and to take all the data    All of the sudden we realized we were killing ourselves putting in fifty different templates  but everyone was using the default mode  OR  for one thing  we had just figured out that all Word Documents had the same typos in them  That s where Autocorrect came in   We instrumented  And it was a fact  It wasn t an opinion anymore    4  Only innovate and you ll lose  Everybody wants to ship a bleeding edge product that changes the world  And there s time for that  Indeed  without it  you d have no company  But to only do that isn t just unwise it s suicidal  Suhail reflected on why the impulse to build  shiny stuff  was often a misstep  He said    When we work on products  we generally care about building the most innovative thing possible  After a year or two  you want to keep making innovative stuff shiny stuff  One hard thing about product planning is to actually say no to the shiny stuff and to grind through the versions that you need    Guess what happened as  co founder  Tim  Trefren  and I kept building shiny stuff  We started to lose  We started to lose customers constantly  It took us about a year to come back and double down on product and iterate  iterate  iterate  There s a product almost all our customers use Funnels  We re on the ninth version    5  Product management s next big opportunity  The old guard  When Suhail and Tim founded Mixpanel in 2009  even Silicon Valley was still looking at outdated  vanity metrics  But then startups began to wake up and track the meaningful actions associated with their products  Now  other industries are waking up  Steven agreed that those companies would build out product management organizations  but that they d have carefully balance what was right for customers and the established systems  Steven said    They re all worried about how their products differentiate them from existing competitors  In the banking world  for example  it turned out that having more branches was not interesting to millennials  But having an app where they can do all the same services at eleven o clock on a Wednesday is  And having that data to drive that app well is a huge competitive advantage    All of these companies  existing customers want a mobile app from them  That sounds easy  but ten usually their mobile app looks exactly like their org chart  Step One is recognition of this problem  They have to bring in someone who can look holistically at the customers and the constraints that you already have internally    It doesn t matter whether you re a leader in a lightning fast startup or in a major titan of industry     For both  product management is the competitive difference in today s market  What all product managers have to learn is a discipline of data  That doesn t mean letting data govern every decision  but knowing where it fits in your organization s decision making and having the patience to build something that meets your customers where they live,"[504 1116 990 24 381 356 1131 1340 802 98 1365]"
507,training-dataset/product/493.txt,product,9 tips from TED speakers on successful product management166 Flares 166 Flares    Being a product manager is not easy  After all  a product or a complete product line is under your full responsibility   from launch through to sales  and every milestone in its lifecycle included   If you re already a product manager and in search of new information  ideas  and insights on product management to help you improve your work performance  or if you aspire to become one  then TED Talks videos and the like can be great sources of inspiration and motivation  Here we ve picked out some nuggets of product management wisdom from nine product managers and business leaders   1 Be a Team Leader  https   www youtube com watch v PVKhoFcTpsI  Josh Elman  former Twitter product manager who has also worked with Facebook and LinkedIn  and currently a partner at Greylock  defines a product manager as someone who helps the team and company in shipping products to its users  Debunking the notion that product managers are CEOs of the product  he emphasizes that they are more of a team leader   They help and guide the team in the ultimate goal of delivering the product to people who will actually use and benefit from the product  He further notes that what makes product managers great is their ability to balance getting the products right and getting it out the doors   2  Lead Through Inspiration  https   www youtube com watch v RNmOml4thdw  Former Wealthfront CEO and VP for Product at LinkedIn Adam Nash expounds on Elman s image of product managers as team leaders when he commented in this Google Ventures hosted talk that good product managers understand the bigger picture and long term goals   Good product managers know that their accomplishment is achieved through holistic effort from the team  and not solely from individual performances  Craig Walker  founder of  dialpad that made UberConference and Dialpad  adds that product managers deal with a lot of people from engineers  designers  marketers   As such  it is essential that a product manager inspires and motivates everyone involved in the product to be on the same page and get the product moving in the right direction   3  Know Your Product by Heart  In the same talk with Nash and Walker  former Google Now VP and present Android VP Johanna Wright discusses the need for product managers to really understand their product  and its users   It s not about just knowing what makes up a product  its features  its specs  all those technical information  Product managers should know  appreciate  and understand their product by heart  It would be even better if they also are actual users  which would help them connect more with their target market   4  Anchor Your Product on its Purpose  https   www ted com talks simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action  In his TED Talk  marketing consultant and best selling author Simon Sinek discusses his idea of the Golden Circle  a three layered concept that deals with a company s or business   why  at the center  followed by the  how  in the second layer  and lastly   what    Sinek posits that what makes a company a cut above the rest is that it builds its business from the core out to the outer layer  The answer to its  why  becomes the company s fundamental value   As Sinek puts it   People don t buy what you do  They buy why you do it   It is the raison d etre the purpose of a company that sets everything about the business into its place   Product managers  and aspiring ones  must keep this in mind when they deal with an assigned product  Know why your company and its product exist  Treat it as the heart and soul of your product  and let it shape how you manage your account   5  Determine how Your Target Market Makes Choices  http   www ted com talks sheena_iyengar_on_the_art_of_choosing  Pepsi or Coke  Regular Coke or Coke Zero  Take your pick   Psycho economist Sheena Iyengar makes an interesting discussion on choices and how people arrive at them  She challenges three American notions regarding choice  that it is best to make your own choices in life  the more choices you have  the more likely you are to make the best choice  and never say no to choice by weaving in cultural specificities and examining the art of choosing under that perspective   Product managers may find Iyengar s insights valuable when it comes to consumer behavior  After all  your consumers come from a specific cultural background  and understanding those backgrounds gives you knowledge of why they buy your product or how likely they are to buy the service you offer   An understanding of your consumer s behavior and the impact it has on their decision making can give you insights on how you can market your product  It enables you to analyze what approach you should use to convince your consumer that your product should be their pick   6  See Limitations as Assets  and not Liabilities  https   www ted com talks navi_radjou_creative_problem_solving_in_the_face_of_extreme_limits  Innovation is often borne out of a need  But in his TED Talk entitled  Creative Problem solving in the face of extreme limits   innovation strategist Navi Radjou says innovation is borne out of a need coupled with limited resources  He talks about Jugaad  a Hindi concept of improvised fixes and clever solutions born in adversity   There are three key points from Radjou s lecture that product managers should take note of  First  keep it simple  Second  leverage off existing services  and lastly  think horizontally  These tips can drive you to create more value despite limited resources   Frugal innovation pushes you to perceive limitations positively  treating them as opportunities rather than obstacles to overcome  Echoing Tim Harford s talk at the last London  mtpcon  Radjou says   Frugal innovation is not about making do  it s about making things better   His discussion stresses that there are always moments for value creation at lower costs  for doing more with less  At the end of the day  consumers consider the value they get from a product and service more than how it was created or what it is made of   7  Be a Purple cow  https   www ted com talks seth_godin_on_sliced_bread  No matter what your product is  or what added value it promises for consumers  if people don t know about it  it does not exist   Seth Godin  an influential entrepreneur and marketer  tells story of the sliced bread and how for 15 years since its invention  no one bought it because the market did not know it existed  He also points out that people today face too many choices  but have too little time  and this forces them to ignore these choices  So  in order to get noticed  you have to be a purple cow amid the ordinary cows   Three nuggets to take away from Godin s discussion  and deliver to your product management team are  create something remarkable  very good is boring  and sell to people who are listening  They all speak to the importance of spreading your ideas and reaching your target clients   8  Handle Small Details Carefully  https   www ted com talks margaret_gould_stewart_how_giant_websites_design_for_you_and_a_billion_others_too  When Facebook s VP of product design Margaret Gould Stewart talks about designing for scale  she notes that there is no such thing as a small detail   A case in point is the redesign of Facebook s Like button  which took the designer over 280 hours to get right  Stewart also reminds designers that  it s not about you or your portfolio  it s about the people that you re designing for  and how your work just might help them live better lives    9  Bridge the gap Between User and Product  https   www youtube com watch v uzNxs2vLK0s  Not a TED talk this one  but a really interesting talk from Intercom product manager Michelle Fitzpatrick about how different users perceive and understand a new product  Different users have different mental models of how a product works  and product designers  manufacturers  and product managers must take this into consideration when making or launching a new product

530,training-dataset/product/1286.txt,product,Top 5 Common Mistakes to Avoid in New Product DevelopmentIs your company working a new product  The process is more risky than you might think  In this guest blog post  writer Brenda Cagara outlines what missteps to avoid during the product development stage   Succeeding in the development of a new product is one thing  but avoiding the inevitable pitfalls that can let your brand business down is entirely different  Annually hundreds and thousands of new products are launched  but do you see all of them disrupting global marketa  Not really  and the major cause of this downfall are the mistakes that the new product manufacturers and launchers make in the process   After going through several investments return reports of various brand products  I have found a way to avoid the downfall  But before we act upon these discoveries  we need to acknowledge the mistakes that we unintentionally make during the development of a new product   Are you interested in keeping your business alive and prosperous  Even if you aren t among those who make mistakes  which don t exist   go through the ones mentioned below just as a reminder of not ever crossing this line  Happy reading   1  Not doing your market research homework   We have our own reasons to keep this mistake at number one  You might have gone through other websites and found this one there too but it s only because of the significance it holds when it comes to starting a new business   Every country or city s market has its own worth  Before you launch  in fact before you start developing a product make sure you have done a thorough market research  A market research helps you understand the demand of the customers in the area and whether they ll appreciate and buy your product or not  Weigh out the pros and cons  profit and loss of developing and launching the new product in the area you are living  Will it be beneficial to stay here and work or shifting to another area might help increase the ROI  Is your product idea perfect or does it have room for improvement  A good market research will answer all such questions for you   2  Thinking that launching the product was the biggest step   Launching a new product is the simplest task to conduct while doing business  Many developers have the wrong impression that launching a product is waving goodbye to the hard work  In reality  it s just the beginning and you need to prepare for the journey ahead   The smooth launch of the new item is followed by its publicity  expert digital marketing services  timely shipping and influential sales  All this work needs to be done by the developer and his hired team  Thus  before you get started  make sure you know the plan you ll be following ahead   3  Focusing too much on advancement that you forget all about the customer s ease of use   We bet your new product would be different  innovative and according to the guidelines of the latest technology  right  Well  we hope it s not too innovative that the customers find it difficult to use and are forced to explore their options   Designing  manufacturing and launching the product should support and attract a huge amount of customers  This is only possible if you ensure them that this new product will change their life and by change you mean ease it up a bit more  Accordingly  as a developer whenever you are working on something new  work on the principles of simplicity  handiness  and invention  Come up with new products but try to keep it modern yet easy to use  Make sure it benefits your end users more than it attracts the customers   4  Not keeping track of the timeframe and budget   Late for the business meeting and your boss will show you your way out  Late to arrive at the office every day and you ll soon be fired   Correspondingly  while working on the manufactured good  take care of the planned development schedule  Performed the desired task as scheduled  collect your shipments and deliver your orders in a timely fashion and keep yourself up to the minute on your daily progress report  Delay a single service to be performed and you ll find yourself buried in a mess  Working incompetently on the budget management issue would result in a similar situation   5  Not finding the right price for your product   This ultimately means that you ll either put a high price on the new product or sell it at a low cost  Either way  your customer is not going to buy it  People tend to look for moderation when it comes to buying a product especially when it s new in the market  Get the right price for your new product which neither puts it in the lavish products shelf nor results in the bankruptcy of your financial accounts   It feels good to work hard and see your new product rising  As a developer  you know all about behind the curtain efforts  Are you willing to risk it all  The favorable answer will be in denial which is why you need to know about the mistakes that you must avoid in the process   About the Author Brenda Cagara has been writing for websites  articles  and blogs for five years now  She has had a fair share of writing on variety of

533,training-dataset/product/395.txt,product,A Map of White Space for Product Managers   Startup Grind   MediumIn reading Facebook  now Instagram  product director Peter Deng s answer to the Quora question  How Can I Learn to Be a Good Product Manager   I was struck by this idea   I once heard an analogy that product management is like filling in the white space between the different roles  I think it s a really important attitude to have  You are the owner  Either do it or delegate it  If you don t  no one else will  Product managers are in the service industry  your role is to serve the teams  and no task is too menial or trivial   The notion of  filling white space  stuck in my head and became one of the primary ways I describe my job as a product manager to those unfamiliar with the role  But what does filling white space really mean  While the term resonates with experienced product managers  is it actionable to those new to the craft  Imagine someone being told this at their first product management job   Ok  figure out the important stuff nobody else is doing and do it  Fill the white space   Where does a product manager look for this critical white space that needs filling  This article strives to answer this question by providing a map   Let s start by getting clear on what  white space   in general  refers to  Wikipedia offers this definition   White space is a process management concept described by Geary A  Rummler and Alan P  Brache in 1991 as the area between the boxes in an organizational chart where  very often  no one is in charge  It is where important handoffs between functions happen and it is where an organization has the greatest potential for improvement as things often  fall between the cracks  or  disappear into black holes   resulting in misunderstandings and delays  Managing white space entails improving an organization s process performance   This definition is pretty straightforward and aligns with Peter Deng s explanation above  But what does white space precisely mean in the realm of software internet product development  Let s look at the people and entities that are necessary for shipping software  The below graphic is a diagram of what I call  The Product Network   figure 1   the fundamental elements of a software product s context  Many aspects of a product and the people who build or use it are variable  but the below elements always must be present   Figure 1  The Product Network   At the heart of the product network is the product itself  The Product  in a software company  literally consists of code deployed to an environment where people can access it  All products are connected to three things  developers  users  and a business   Developers  or engineers  are the people who can write and deploy code  Companies usually have people working on the product that aren t programming  but the people updating the code are the only folks on the team who are strictly necessary which is why they are the only company role included as fundamental element in the product network  Developers can perform all company duties  while not always effectively    Users  or  less broadly   customers   are the people who either use the product or might use the product  All products have the goal of being used  on some level  by people   The Business is the entity that funds and hopes to benefit  e g  profit  from the product  Whether the organization is for profit or non profit  there is a bank with a finite amount of funds   It is possible for a product to exist in a network with only the minimum set of elements in The Product Network  A company can be founded with developers  some form of financial persistence  and a dream of building a user base  But this leaves white space   White space  can be conceived of as missing links in the product network  roles that  if filled  lead to a better functioning product network  and  consequently a more successful product  Specifically  there are three regions of white space indicated by A  B  and C in Figure 2 below   Figure 2  White space regions   White Space A  Region A is the white space that exists between developers  the product  and users  Developers and users have different mental models of a product  Developers  on the one hand  can use the product they build  but their mental model is imbued with knowledge of how the product is implemented  Therefore  when considering potential enhancements  hard working  talented engineers have a natural bias towards solutions that are relatively low effort and don t add ugly complexities to the code base  Users  on the other hand  only know a product through how they interact with it on their screen  They may be able to formulate educated guesses for how it works under the hood  but they don t know and usually don t care  Users want to use products because they re gratifying or solve their problems  regardless of how expensive it was to build or the code s aesthetics   While there are engineers who can effectively see a product through the eyes of its users and fill this region of white space  growing businesses require dedicated brains to bridge the divide between users and developers  The role of a designer is the clearest example  Designers are responsible for understanding the mental models of users and devising user interfaces accordingly for developers to implement  But many other dedicated roles fill this this white space  web analytics  marketing  editorial  usability research  information architecture  technical support  community management  and quality assurance  to name a few  Some of these roles are focused on building a development team s understanding of users  others are focused on communicating more effectively about the product to existing users and attracting potential new ones   White Space B  Region B is the white space that exists between users  the product  and the business  It s where the the value that people find using the product is  hopefully  converted to profit  or other benefit  for the business  The complexity in the region is largely dictated by whether  the users of the product are paying directly for it  or user attention is attracted to sell to advertisers   Examples of  1 are eCommerce or subscription based products  In this case  the duties of white space region B are to effectively use company funds to attract potential customers  e g   through traditional advertising  search engine marketing  or sales   extract as much revenue as possible from each user  and guide expansion of the product into the most lucrative markets   Examples of  2 are social networks and media companies  This case is complex because you have to divide the  Users  node in the product network into two branches   A  the ostensible users of the product  e g   the person posting on Facebook or reading the New York Times  and  B  the advertisers who pay to reach those users  In this case  the role of players in white space region B is to maximize value to advertisers by influencing the product design to extract information about user preferences  demographics  behaviors  and interests  They also must must market the product to potential advertisers and design pricing models to optimize profits   There is  perhaps  a third case of venture backed startups that are trying to grow a user base first and monetize later  In this scenario  there is still a need for people to fill white space B  The duties involve keeping the investors happy and growing vanity metrics  unique users  page views  that signal to the world that the product can be monetized in the future   White Space C  Region C is the white space that exists between the business  the product  and the developers  This is where the company decides where funds and development effort is focused  At a high level  this entails the formulation and communication of a business vision that can serve as a guiding light for projects  sometimes owned by the CEO   At a low level  this entails the prioritization of specific engineering features  chores  or bug fixes  sometimes owned by a project manager   It also involves answering hard questions around  buy versus build  when it comes to filling technology needs  Region C is where the company translates ideas to execution   As a reference  I ve included Figure 3 below to provide examples of the roles that fill each region of white space  It is by no means a comprehensive list   it is intended to quickly convey the flavor of what each region is all about   Figure 3  Examples of the roles that fill each region of white space   So now what   If you want to understand the white space around your product  you can make your own map and act on it  Here s how to do it   Start by printing out the diagram of an empty product network  figure 1   For each non developer team member who contributes in some fashion to the product  draw a line for them in the appropriate white space region  A  B or C   Ask yourself  what crucial links in the network are missing for your product  Then  of course  it s your job to fill the white space  or enlist someone to do what needs to be done   Here are some examples of white space maps  If you make one for your product  I would love to see it   Note  I m expanding and refining the ideas found here on my web site  Product Logic,"[533 381 192 24 98 1365 692 138 423 302 356]"
580,training-dataset/product/3.txt,product,Great Product Managers Have an Amplifying Effect120 Flares 120 Flares    After all these years designing digital products and services at Clearleft  we ve finally realised the secret of our success  and it has nothing to do with us  Well  maybe not NOTHING  but our most satisfying client engagements all have one thing in common  as do our least satisfying engagements   and that s client side product management   Catalysts  Enablers  and Informed Negotiators  When we have a dedicated client side product manager who understands modern digital design practices  and is committed to delivering a great solution  we re able to focus on solving the problem at hand without worrying about organisational friction  Decisions arise and are dealt with almost immediately  helping maintain momentum  More tricky challenges are removed from the process and dealt with in a separate branch  being folded back into the project at the appropriate juncture  A good product manager acts as a permanent champion of the product  as well as a surrogate for organisational decision making   By comparison  when we find ourselves in the situation of having little or no client side product management  progress is slowed as we try to navigate the internal political terrain  and clear the barriers ourselves  The process becomes a series of gates we need to navigate  where stakeholders with little day to day involvement in the project attempt to get a clear enough picture of the landscape to make critical decisions  This tends to reduce both momentum and the quality of decision making   The Missing Ingredient  This was brought home to us recently when working for two very similar organisations in the same sector  One project was led by a full time product manager who understood Agile and had the authority to make decisions without referring them up the chain  Because of this  issues were addressed on a continuous basis  and both momentum and quality remained high  Everybody enjoyed working on the project and the initial engagement has led on to future work   The other project also had a product manager assigned to it  but they lacked prior PM experience  We suggested agile product management training but were assured that this wasn t necessary and their team  got Agile   It quickly became apparent that they didn t have a handle on things like backlog management  so we ended up making decisions around priorities and resource allocation that should have been made by the business   When larger decisions needed to be made  they were passed up the ranks  often losing touch with the original problem along the way  The process would invariably take several weeks to resolve  drawing important resources away from the project  With nobody owning the process from the client side  or filtering feedback  the results often clashed with strategic objectives made by other stakeholders  causing lots of political wrangling along the way   Intangible Yet Essential  None of this is unusual  and it s all stuff our project managers and design leads are more than capable of handling  Still  where one project felt smooth and efficient the other felt challenging and fraught with compromises  where one team felt energised by the experience  the other felt exhausted  where one project focussed on solving problems and delivering solutions  the other focussed on clearing paths and building understanding all important things  but all things that come as standard with a dedicated product manager   We ve seen this experience replicated a few times  so we re going to encourage our clients to appoint a dedicated product manager from here on in  Somebody who can give the product the attention and focus it deserves   This means clearing the decks  handing Business As Usual  BAU  tasks over to other people  and making yourself available for the duration of the project  Ideally it will involve some form of co location as it s difficult to be party to the day to day decisions if you re out of the room  So embed yourself in the team  own group decisions  and champion the resulting product around the organisation   It s still possible to deliver amazing projects when this doesn t happen  It just takes more time  effort and resources three things that clients often find in short supply  As a result we re going to be a lot more caution working with clients that lack experienced and dedicated product management  and will adjust our approach accordingly,"[580 1099 468 1116 356 1131 142 802 1365 98 46]"
600,training-dataset/product/1360.txt,product,Build Strong Product Teams by Hiring Graduates23 Flares 23 Flares    Last October I took part in Digital Wave  a conference in Bournemouth that brings together over 1 000 young people between the ages of 14 and 19 to learn about the opportunities offered by a career in the technology sector   I attended the conference to represent product careers  a project I launched last year to raise awareness of Product Management as a career path  with a particular focus on undergraduates and graduates  I started the project in response to challenges I had recruiting entry level product managers for Crowdcube  It had become clear to me that there is little awareness of Product Management as a role among students in the UK   It was inspiring to speak to so many young people at Digital Wave for whom Product Management resonated as a career option   once they understood it  This has also been my experience when visiting universities to speak to students about Product Management over the last year  Many graduates are keen to work in a startup or technology company  but are not aware of the existence of the Product Manager role  and that it is ideally suited to them   Graduates Need Opportunities  However raising awareness among students is just one half of the challenge  In order to build a strong pipeline of up and coming Product Managers  it s equally important that there are employment opportunities available to them   Large technology companies such as Google  Facebook  and Yahoo  all offer graduate recruitment and training programmes for Product Managers  but their annual intake is small  and mostly outside the UK  As a result  most Product Managers move into the role part way through their career  They either discover the role by working alongside Product Managers within a company and pursue a career change  or are courted by existing Product Managers who recognise their potential   Consequently the majority of technology companies are not in the habit of offering graduate level positions  or recognising the student community as a potential source of new Product Managers  This also leads to a lack of placement and internship opportunities for undergraduates   The Benefits of Hiring Graduates  I worked alongside graduates who were part of Google s Associate Product Manager programme for many years  and was consistently impressed by their passion and productivity  This perception has only been reinforced since I started introducing graduates into my own team  which has delivered a number of benefits   Energy  Young people have boundless energy and enthusiasm  and have grown up with technology woven through their lives  They have a healthy disrespect for the impossible  and are looking to make a positive impact on the world   Diversity  Graduates have not yet put down roots  and are open to roles around the country  which increases the size and diversity of your pool of qualified candidates  Young people also increase the age diversity of your team  offering new perspectives on technology trends   Affordability  Salary expectations for an entry level role are significantly lower than for an experienced candidate  For a startup keeping a tight rein on its burn rate  well mentored graduates can be a very cost effective way of building a highly effective product team   Self Improvement  Graduate level Product Managers start out as a blank canvas  and will need mentoring to develop into a great Product Manager  As the hiring manager  this requires you to keep your skills and knowledge up to date  so that you can train them in current best practices  In larger organisations  graduates also provide mentoring opportunities for your existing team   Graduates are an Investment  It is important to understand that hiring graduates is not just cheap labour  It s a commitment and a responsibility  You are sculpting this person s career  and the value you extract from them in the long term will be a direct reflection of the effort you put into training and mentoring them  Hiring graduates is an investment that can reap significant rewards over time  but you must be willing to dedicate the time and energy needed to coach them  and help them establish themselves as a Product Manager   For example  we ensure that all new graduate Product Managers in the team attend an introductory course  such as the Product Management Essentials workshop run by Mind the Product  We set them a small introductory project that is low risk  and pair them with an experienced developer who can coach them on working with software engineers  We provide training in areas not covered by their academic background  such as technical skills  problem solving  or public speaking  and we encourage them to participate in community events such as ProductCamp  or in public hackathons   Choosing the Right Graduates  As with recruiting into any Product Manager role  it s important that you choose carefully when filling a graduate position  Graduates may not have a track record of product delivery  are less likely to offer references from previous employers  and will be unfamiliar with the  language  of Product Managers such as KPIs  OKRs  and Sprints  You must therefore focus your hiring process on selecting the candidates who most strongly demonstrate the character traits of a successful Product Manager   They must be intelligent  positive  self motivated  a good communicator  and have the humility to listen and learn  It s not necessary to limit yourself to recruiting from technical degrees  but you do need people who are passionate about technology  and recognise its potential as a force for good  Students now live their lives   both social and academic   online  so set them exercises to critique one or two apps and services they use  discuss opportunities for new products  and debate the impact that up and coming technology will have on our lives   Often the most promising students are those who have demonstrated leadership  initiative  or entrepreneurship  They may have managed a student society  edited a student newspaper  started a company  built an app  participated in a startup weekend  mentored other students  or performed charity work   Strengthen Your Team and the Ecosystem  If you re looking to grow your team  I highly recommend that you consider offering one or more graduate positions  By offering Product Management roles to graduates and mentoring those you recruit  you re not just building a stronger and more diverse team  You re also contributing to the health of the technology ecosystem  and paving the way for the next generation of product visionaries   If you re not in a position to recruit right now  but would like to help raise awareness of Product Management among graduates  please get in touch  Introductions to contacts at UK university societies  careers services  and academic departments are particularly valuable  Plus I m always looking for Product Managers willing to contribute to our growing library of video interviews  and inspire young people to explore Product Management for themselves,"[600 24

605,training-dataset/product/844.txt,product,Becoming an Industry Agnostic Product Manager172 Flares 172 Flares    General Skills  As a product manager  you are at the epicentre of the wider product team  the glue holding all the pieces together  What I ve realised in my years of managing product across multiple sectors is that this role does not deviate or change significantly  regardless of industry  whatever product you produce  or for whatever type of end user  In fact  I d say that the role of a product manager is industry agnostic  You can transfer the skill set and experience of a good product manager anywhere and see great results   I ve been a product manager in several industries  and for a wide range of end users  I ve managed websites  produced interactive TV games  iPad newspaper broadsheet apps  digital marketing SaaS for B2B professional services  event apps  news desktop software and mobile apps for financial professionals  and more  In each of these roles  I ve had to learn the market  start from scratch in knowing my customer  and work very closely with technologists  But not once have I had to change my overarching product management methodology or had to waver from using my toolkit of best practice approaches to product management  as they did the job perfectly well in each context   The Transition Challenge  I ve used several tools and skill sets to manage the transition across several industries and product types  these I refer to as the core best practice methodologies  competitor analysis  stakeholder management  product knowledge  market understanding  product requirement writing  good communication and relationship building   I believe the first step for anyone in a new role is to get to know the lead developer  Find the person who understands all aspects of the product  front end  back end  technical architecture and so on and spend as much time with them as you can  asking them all about the product  its history  limitations  present day challenges and where the dev team think it should go  Then talk to the product team or your peers to get their input from a product perspective   what s good about the product  what s not and how do they think the product or set of features should evolve   The second critical step is to spend time with your customers  Be as immersive as you can  either by talking to them directly if possible  or by talking to sales and support staff  or both  and of course by looking at all customer research  reports  and online survey results  In my last role I spent three months with customers  client specialists and the research team before I was ready to begin producing a product strategy   Lastly you need to know your stakeholders  from the people in your business that you are accountable to  to business owners and industry experts  If you get to know your key stakeholders   what they think of your product  what their challenges are  what they need to achieve   and curate a plan that will ensure they also achieve their goals  you will be on to a winner  For more on stakeholder analysis and tools to manage your stakeholders check out this guide  Pragmatic Producteer   Stakeholder Mgt   Of course the conversations above depend on the organisation  start ups and early stage products vs  enterprise   legacy products  the people available to you  or the status of the product itself  play a part in how much knowledge you can garner from these conversations  But customers will always give you valuable insight  developers and engineers will have thoughts worth hearing and your key stakeholders KPIs are intrinsic to the success of your product  If you nurture these relationships you will create a solid foundation upon which you can begin to build a viable product roadmap strategy   Essential Mantras of Product Management  I ve found the following invaluable   Communication  clear  consistent and regular  what s the last update you gave to your key stakeholders  keep pivotal players in the loop at all times   Relationship building  identify your key peers and stakeholders and work with them well  know what drives them  what they are trying to achieve   Customer knowledge  spend all the time you can spare with your customers and research team  Commission surveys and research projects as much as is necessary to ensure you are constantly in touch with how your customers are interacting with your product   Analytics  learn to LOVE your analytics tools  product reports regularly and if you don t have a BA  Business Analyst  become one  Product Knowledge  know your product inside out  learn its history and the product team themselves   how they have shaped and changed the product before you got there  Business Strategy  understand your product s place in the business strategy  is it following it or driving it   Competition  know your competition  understand how you ll become better than them and know what is good as well as what s bad about what your they have to offer  Tech Stack  understand the technology as much as you can   you don t have to be an expert  just know where the limitations and challenges are  Market Landscape  know what lies ahead in your industry  its driving factors and core players  not just the competition but all relevant players and tech and usage trends  User Experience  be a UX evangelist   work with internal UX experts or agency UX teams to ensure you know the best user experience you could provide your customers   and then work towards delivering it  Position yourself to become an industry agnostic product manager  I think any good product manager can choose to widen their scope when looking for that next challenge  If you believe that you could apply the methodologies and mantras I ve described to another product or industry  then all you need to take that leap is confidence   Even when the job spec calls for prior knowledge or industry experience  you can reduce the gap between yourself and other candidates if you have this confidence  If you can go to an interview having done your research  and learnt the key aspects of the industry you are interested in and taken the time to get to grips with the market  tech and competition  then any prospective employer will see the value you could bring to the role as a solid product manager  You ll be seen as someone hungry to

631,training-dataset/product/1432.txt,product,How Product Managers Can Avoid Design by CommitteeWe have all heard of Design by Committee the most frustrating of situations where too many opinions need to be heard and too many egos spoil what could have been and excellent product or project  It is something that Product Managers must deal with as they work to get their product approved by the required executive channels   The first step in getting past this in each product discovery effort is the identification of a trio of key people  These are the three people who will keep the product on point and moving in the right direction  The product development lead  the user experience lead and the product manager  It is imperative that they closely collaborate in order to in order to properly resolve issues in useful and new ways  Ultimately when they are working on gaining approval from upper management the product manager will be the one to take the lead  The product manager will bring forth the knowledge regarding the requirements of upper management alongside the responsibility of ensuring that the product still has value   The product manager must understand that they are the representative of the business owners  customer support  finance  legal  product marketing  sales and company executives  In many cases this means that they must be careful of entertaining any opinions outside of the product development process so that the the product development ideas do not become a perpetual brainstorming session  It is never ideal for the product manager to allow for the project to be taken over by those who have agendas outside of the natural flow of business  For example a customer service manager might make suggestions that would ease the pressure on their agents knowing that suggestion might ultimately harm the product  It is crucial that the team remain as small as possible   According to Gartner analysts   The challenge of keeping track of what your staff knows and what they are really capable of has become considerably more complex  Organizations are more geographically dispersed than ever before and the trend is toward more virtual offices and transient teams    Innovation will not truly occur within the presence of a large group setting  This type of setting will do little more than create a situation where the product manager will be bouncing through a plethora of large and small decisions and discussions as progress is drastically slowed down  With a smaller non design by committee setting  you will be left in charge of a small  empowered and driven team that will be able to remain on track with all objectives  tasks and deadlines   The true key of avoiding the pitfalls of design by committee is to keep the team empowered  Your team will need to feel and be empowered to properly represent stakeholders and make critical decisions  This does not result in the team having a blank check  decisions will need to be reviewed by various stakeholders with adjustments being made as they are necessary   Gartner Analysts issue this warning   Never underestimate the importance of ego in driving knowledge sharing    In order for the trio model to work outside of the committee setting  the team will need to be entrusted to give their very best effort as they keep the needs of the stakeholders in mind  It has been consistently proven that the utilization of a small group of motivated and talented people results in great and profitable products that are able to thoroughly satisfy stakeholders   As companies grow  some executives believe that development teams need to grow as well  This is far from the truth  Avoiding design by committee is once instance where less is will truly deliver more,"[631 692 356 98 1365 1032 605 302 1329 142 121]"
688,training-dataset/product/565.txt,product,Six Effective Process Hacks from Top Product LeadersEach month at General Catalyst  we host functional leaders from high growth startups across New York for a discussion on a relevant industry theme or challenge   Our most recent working session  led by former CTO   Digital Product Lead of Birchbox Liz Crawford  centered around structuring product teams and best practices for product management  When Crawford first joined Birchbox  the startup had just 15 employees and thousands of subscribers  During her five years as CTO  Crawford helped scale to a 300 person company with offices in four countries and a million monthly subscribers   Crawford s perspective was complemented by Chief Product Officers from Classpass  BarkBox  Oscar Health  Abacus  Squarespace  and more  Hailing from startups ranging from a few to a few hundred employees  from seed to growth stage  and representing both enterprise and consumer businesses  these CPOs shared shortcuts with wide applicability   1  Institute planning processes across the organization  When starting a new project  dedicate time to outline milestones and stakeholders  and align the team around clearly articulated goals  By frontloading this work  you can anticipate issues that may arise and address them ahead of time   Here are some of the best practices the group uses in product planning   Maintain a problem driven rather than solution driven approach to development  Build a  hypothesis roadmap  ahead of each project   Keeping a broader team aligned around the problem at hand prevents folks from getting wedded to a single approach for solving it and allows for more autonomy   Sarah Schwarzbeck   Senior Director of Product at Plated  says   Senior Director of Product at Plated  says  1stdibs has adopted Amazon s famous  press release  approach to product development planning  which involves having developers draft a hypothetical press release or news article covering the product  before writing even a line of code  This backwards approach ensures products are customer driven rather than PM driven and encourages developers to articulate the product s broader impact  Xiaodi Zhang  Chief Product Officer at 1stdibs says    Define a project s metrics for success in advance  That way  you know when to kill it   Idan Cohen  CEO   Co founder of Grow  says   One of the worst things that can happen to an organization is if you get too committed to something that isn t working    2  Build institutional memory  Documenting and sharing best practices across the organization enables teams to learn from the past  better understand customer behavior and preferences  and avoid repeat mistakes   While the benefits of routine knowledge sharing may not be immediately realized  these lessons prove a vital resource when scaling from one product to two  onboarding new employees  or when opening a second office   Here are some of the procedural hacks the group uses for effective knowledge sharing   At Classpass  product managers send company wide updates following every major meeting  recapping key decisions made and highlighting relevant documents  These communications are then pasted into a Google Doc  so the entire process is documented   If you re new  you can just click on the  customer acquisition  section and see how we arrived at what we re doing today   Justin Chang  Head of Product Management at Classpass  says   At Flow  product managers share pre launch briefs with the entire company and follow up with true  transparent testing results  Whether you work as a back end engineer or at the front desk  this helps everyone in the company build a comprehensive understanding of their customer and the processes that work best  Andrew Chen  SVP Product Management at Flow  explained   Abacus runs Net Promoter Score  NPS  results through a company wide Slack channel  Posting these results sparks productive side conversations across teams   The good ones feel really good and the bad ones feel really productive   Co founder   Design Lead Ted Power says   3  Structure your team to own different points of customer experience  When building your product organization  consider aligning teams around different stages of the customer journey  Jeremiah Zinn  Chief Product Officer at BarkBox  divides product into two subteams  The first focuses on getting a customer to their site to subscribe  The second focuses on retaining customers for as long as possible  Zhang s team at 1stdibs separates product into user acquisition centric and conversion centric teams   Whatever the structure  be sure each team is oriented around relevant KPIs  Crawford emphasized  This way  it s clear which team drives and owns each metric of success   4  Team structure isn t one size fits all  As companies scale  products and goals scale too  The product team s structure should evolve to reflect these shifting goals   In the early days  product strategy is driven by urgency  As your business scales  thoughtful product strategy becomes really important  and a bigger part of your job   Crawford says   The hiring criteria for product managers often change as your company transitions through various stages  Crawford notes  In the early days  startups rely on managers with versatile skills that can support operations across the organization  As you enter the growth stage  teams become more specialized allowing for strategic hires   What defines  early  vs  growth  and how can you anticipate this transition   Jeremiah Zinn of BarkBox suggests an 80 person team is the breaking point where infrastructure becomes essential   At that point  you no longer have everyone sitting in one scrum asking  what s the most important thing to do next     Zinn says   When your customer base has scaled and you have a bigger organization suddenly you can and need to focus on more infrastructure oriented projects like billing  inventory or user authentication   The  DACI   Driver  Approver  Contributor  Informed  model to product management helped Classpass successfully navigate this transition  Chang  explained  This taskforce esque model includes creating groups comprised of at least one representative from each role involved in the project  This group meets regularly throughout the project and is involved in all major decisions from planning to launch  The DACI model increases accountability and ensures all relevant parties are informed throughout the process  Chang said   5  Don t underestimate the importance of internal PMs  As companies transition into the growth stage  developing the infrastructure to support high velocity product development is essential   Having an internal product or platform manager can prove really effective  especially for companies that leverage third party services  Zinn says  This is someone dedicated to building software product to make internal operational workflows more efficient   Managing internal PMs alongside external PMs requires thought  Crawford highlights  because their projects  goals  skills and concerns are often very different   6  Don t build anything   dramatic pause  yet   The best advice Zinn has ever received came from one of BarkBox s earliest advisors  a founder at Urban Outfitters  who said  making their first store perfect almost prevented us from openning a hundred more     The best opportunities are ahead of us   Zinn says   We risk missing them if we overbuild what we have now,"[688 66 692 1131 1116 121 802 98 1365

692,training-dataset/product/474.txt,product,What Highly Effective Product Teams Are Doing DifferentlySomeone asked me recently   What makes an effective product team    Good question     ProdPad has been a product focused team from the start   after all  ProdPad is a product for product managers to do their product management  built by product managers   It s so very meta   But as our team grows  it s helpful to look back at what s helping us stay product oriented so we can double down on what s working for us   Here are my observations   1  An effective product team makes product discussions accessible to everyone else at the company   One day  a deeply annoyed Elon Musk sent all of SpaceX a memo titled  Acronyms Suck   It was an executive order to stop using acronyms in the workplace because it was hindering basic communication among employees    Excessive use of made up acronyms is a significant impediment to communication and keeping communication good as we grow is incredibly important  Individually  a few acronyms here and there may not seem so bad  but if a thousand people are making these up  over time the result will be a huge glossary that we have to issue to new employees  No one can actually remember all these acronyms and people don t want to seem dumb in a meeting  so they just sit there in ignorance    He was right  When you start to speak in your own language  in team speak  others can t meaningfully participate in the conversation   The product mindset requires everyone at the company to be able to discuss the product in terms everyone can understand   A truly effective product team communicates with sales  support  marketing  development  QA and so on  in a way that is meaningful to each of those teams   We do two things to keep our product conversation open to everyone on the team   We give everyone access to our product backlog  Everyone can drop in ideas  suggestions  and comment on existing ideas   We review and respond on an ongoing basis   We don t accept ideas without a short 1 2 sentence business case  a high level argument for moving that idea forward  This filters out frivolous ideas   This process forces everyone to think about their suggestions in terms of business value rather than personal preferences   What problem are we trying to solve   What value would it provide if it were solved   Essentially  if you want something done to the product  you have to defend it in terms everyone understands  If you re suggesting something that doesn t move the needle  then is it worth suggesting  Is it worth taking up several people s time to work on   These kinds of questions are now baked into our company culture   2  Effective product teams use high level product and business goals to drive their team level work  Call them what you want   OKRs  KPIs  objectives   but effective product teams assign high level product goals that everyone else can contribute to   Any of these are tangible enough to work   Increase trial to paid conversions by 15   Reduce new user churn by 3   Increase trials to 500 per month  When we decided to increase our trial to paid conversions  each of us took off to complete our own set of tasks   Our CPO went into our analytics to dig up user behavior during the trial period   That told us which actions our most successful users were taking before they became paid customers   Our Head of Growth designed an email drip that would convince new customers to take those actions right away   Our Head of Customer Success created a set of masterclass videos to visually teach new users how to take those first actions   Meanwhile  we got together as a team to redesign our entire onboarding experience   The actual nature of the objectives will differ per product team  as they are usually tied to the product itself   For SaaS metrics  get this cheat sheet from Chartmogul    But the principle remains the same   if you want to keep everyone aligned around your product  set goals that are tightly wrapped around your product   3  Effective product teams give company wide access to customer feedback and support tickets   Slack gets all my love for this one   We ve set up a Slack channel to send us incoming Zendesk tickets so that all of us are in on them   In companies where customer support is considered a separate function  everyone else misses out on the stream of raw customer feedback  comments and questions   As far as I m concerned  this is as good as gold   Our Head of Customer Success also ropes all of us into doing customer support when she needs us  Rather than pinging us separately  ask how to answer  and answer the ticket herself   she assigns us the tickets that we re better positioned to answer   We also use our own Slack ProdPad integration to send all our customer feedback into our backlog  Rather than make an informal comment over lunch  X customer just told me she hates our new rollout   we collect them in ProdPad   Here  they become a formal part of our product process  So long as we put our notes back into ProdPad  they will be seen  tagged and they will be considered when the time comes to address that issue   The alternative is that the customer feedback we field we re on the road meeting customers  at conferences  and so on just disappears into thin air   4  Effective product teams invest in making users feel badass  People use products that make them feel badass  and they invest time and energy in products that make them feel badass   That s developer evangelist Kathy Sierra s message to product companies  make your users feel awesome  badass and good at what they do   Sometimes  this means thinking beyond the product itself   We take our cues from companies like Unbounce  a company whose marketing strategy is to create and give away the most useful digital marketing knowledge possible  Their resources are so well produced  thorough and genuinely useful that it hardly qualifies as marketing in the traditional sense   I see it as effectively a companion product to its landing page tool   a growing library of webinars  courses  e books and posts that is helping users become really confident marketers   This collaboration of marketing and product  which don t always cooperate as they should  is a clear victory for the company   Where are customers struggling  What do they want to learn more about  What would make them more confident at work or in life   There s your sweet spot   Similarly  our own marketing revolves around helping our users become better product managers   For example  when we saw one of our blogs  How to Build a Product Roadmap Everyone Understands  start to attract significant traffic  we doubled down the topic  Now  our free  in depth e course on the same topic has become the go to resource for building a simple and agile product roadmap   Is it marketing  Is it customer success  Based on my experience  just say no to labels and do whatever makes your users feel smart and ready to take on the world    5  Effective product teams put the final decision and or veto power in the hands of a single product manager   Sure  there are risks to giving one person the power to decide what stays or goes but the alternative is death by committee   and it s hard to recover from a culture like that   Product decisions made by committee result in compromise  and compromise is how Windows 8 happened   Leave the back and forth shuffling and the mealy mouthed product decisions to a less imaginative product company  It takes a single bold product leader who has the power to insist to catapult products into first place  There is one caveat  before making that final call  product managers should ask their colleagues what they think   One of our customers Ajay Dawar  VP of Product Management   Design at Everstring  does this in a really interesting way   First  he talks to the CEO and exec team about what they believe the product direction should be  Then  he poses the following question to each team leader    Over the next 90 days  what s the most important thing for us to do    Based on those discussions  he curates a set of ideas from an otherwise long product backlog for them to stack rank  Stank ranking effectively forces his colleagues to assign their priorities a numbered list   no ties allowed   A committee might be tempted to say   Can we squeeze in both   But he has the full support of the company to makes the final decision   Speaking of final decisions  the other caveat is this  No decision has to be final  Any good product team is always testing  learning and iterating based on the results   Every product decision should be subject to change,"[692 1116 381 1365 98 1131 423 990 356 24 1032]"

776,training-dataset/product/1104.txt,product,Find  Vet and Close the Best Product ManagersTodd Jackson has been a part of product organizations across some of the best companies in the Valley  from Google to Facebook to Twitter  after it acquired his own startup  Cover  Now VP of Product and Design at Dropbox  he s worked with hundreds of product managers   and hired dozens   over the course of his career   When Jackson was at Twitter  the company surveyed its engineering  product and design teams  asking what they thought and knew about each other s areas of expertise  While everyone was clear on what engineers did  write code   and the majority could describe the responsibilities of designers  less than half of respondents knew what product managers actually did  This seemed like something the product team  and Jackson in particular as Director of Product Management  should dig into   Unsurprisingly  it turned out the PMs knew exactly what everyone else did    As he asked more people what they thought PMs did  he realized that everyone had different answers   I think that s because the PM role needs to be purposely flexible  almost by design   he says   A PM basically sits at the center of UX  technology and business  You may have heard the quote   The PM is the CEO of their product   I think that s pretty accurate  but it also means they have to do a lot of diverse things well  and good ones are extremely hard to find    In this interview  Jackson explains how startups can define the type of PMs they need  source candidates  ask the right interview questions   and  perhaps most importantly  convince them to come work for you   WHAT MAKES AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT MANAGER   The best product managers do three things   Articulate what a winning product looks like   Rally the team to build it   Iterate on it until they get it right   Doing this well no matter what you re building or environment you re working in requires a specific set of qualities  Jackson breaks them into three categories  Must Haves  Good To Haves and Bonus Qualities   Outstanding intellectual ability and the ability to synthesize information both help a PM identify what a winning product will look like  and how it will succeed strategically in its market  Excellent communication  leadership and effectiveness within the company culture are required to articulate the vision for that product and get others excited to devote their time and energy   I ve never seen a truly great product manager that did not have all four qualities in the Must Have column   Jackson says   In the Good To Have column  technical background and entrepreneurial spirit will help a PM gain the loyalty and credibility they need to motivate the best work from engineers and designers  Analytical and strategic thinking are necessary for constant  smart iteration  Most well known tech companies like Dropbox will only hire PMs who have both columns A and B covered   The bonus features  like writing code  creating mockups  and running their own analysis is what you might look for in an early hire or on a small team  They ll maximize your productivity per person  At larger companies  you tend to have more people to specialize in these tasks so PMs don t usually need to  It s always nice to have them  They re just more critical at some times than others in a company s life  The extra effort should be made for a first product hire  Jackson says    This definition of what a PM needs to be and have is probably 70  right for most companies   he says   But if you re a SaaS company with a huge sales team  you might have a different archetype in mind than if you re a 40 person social app company   So think about what s core to the success of a PM at your company and then what the more  elective  attributes might be that are tailored to your industry and product in particular  Actually write the list  It makes a big difference to see it laid out visually when you start talking to candidates   FINDING THE RIGHT CANDIDATE  As you search for a PM  you ll get a blend of proactive applicants and referrals  but it s also a good idea to source candidates yourself on LinkedIn  The latter will give you a more refined sense of who s out there with what experience and how that maps to what you need the person in the role to do   While there is no single successful PM archetype  Jackson likes to think there are a handful of PM personas that can work well  All five of the anonymized profiles below are representative of amazing product managers he knows personally  and show the breadth of diverse backgrounds that can make great PMs   It s important to look for diverse experiences and backgrounds   Jackson says   Your users and customers are likely a diverse set of people  so your employees should be too  This can actually be a big competitive advantage over other companies that think too rigidly or homogeneously about their hiring    The Classic Choice  This is the resume with a more conventional PM background   Computer Science undergraduate degree from a school like Georgia Tech  Brown  Rice or University of Illinois   schools with great CS programs  Founded a non profit community summer program in college  Product Manager at a large tech company  worked on advertiser facing products and then video products   I like the range of experience here   says Jackson   Experience working on advertiser and publisher facing products  as well as consumer facing video products around search and discovery  Plus she had the initiative to start a non profit  This is someone you definitely want to talk to    The Rookie Prospect  Robotics undergraduate degree from Olin College  Course Assistant for a History of Technology Class  Product Management Intern at a large tech company   Whenever you re talking to someone who has no full time work experience  it s a very high risk  high reward prospect  So you have to do your best to look for evidence of their capabilities  The number one sign I have here is that they went to Olin College  which some folks might not have heard of  but I know by reputation produces great product managers   says Jackson   The PMs I ve known who went to Olin were all very technical but also creative  Their course assistant work is a touch of the humanities  It s a technical background married with creative user facing experience  Definitely worth a phone call    The Management Consulting Refugee  Psychology degree from Emory  Data Analyst at a startup developing search technology  including web crawling and document processing tools   Senior Business Analyst at a well known consulting firm   You see this profile pretty often these days   people who want to get into tech from consulting or finance   says Jackson   And a lot of them would make great product managers because they have the analytical thinking and strategic mindset  But you have to make sure they have a true passion for technology and solving user needs  Also  are they going to be willing to collaborate effectively with engineers and designers or just provide directives and assume their instructions will be followed  These are the two most common pitfalls I see when hiring people from this background    The ideal version of this profile includes what this sample resume has  some experience working in technology  Technical background is a good indicator of problem solving ability and a desire to build things  But even then  the culture at some consulting shops conditions people to lead through force or command and control methods rather than excitement and influence   When you talk to these candidates  always ask them about how they lead   and you want to hear them to talk about how they lead through example    Engineer Designer Turned PM  Senior member of technical staff at successful SAAS company  Software engineer at a small startup focused on productivity software  States in her LinkedIn summary that she has  a strong interest in usability and likes direct interaction with users     I love this type of profile because you know if this person actually has the product skills you re looking for  they re going to be great at working with the engineers or designers on the team   says Jackson   If someone s entire experience is in engineering  you want to look for other signs that she is a product thinker  Here it s in the person s summary  but not every engineer will say something like that    In the absence of a clearly stated interest in or experience with product  you want to look for evidence of the person taking on steep learning curves and growing fast  Did she teach herself new programming languages to work on a project  Did he rise swiftly in an organization  Those actions indicate that they re entrepreneurial enough to flexibly shift into a product role   Marketer Biz Dev Turned PM  International Business and Marketing degree  Cal State Poly  Co founder  a startup focused on developing social ads and products  Business and Corporate Development at a large tech company   This one can be challenging because many great marketing and biz dev people can dazzle you   they are really good at talking about tech products  but you have to be careful   Jackson says   Can they really build stuff  Have they built anything in the past    Let s say that while at their last company they led deals where they had to understand technical and product integrations   that would be a positive indicator  Also  as a co founder  this person built and launched products from scratch    You can see that a CS degree isn t always required   he says   But it does help  If they don t have a technical background  then they should have impressive entrepreneurial experience mentioned elsewhere in their past roles    Todd Jackson  Dropbox s VP of Product and Design  THE IDEAL INTERVIEW PROCESS  The typical PM interview has three stages  phone screen or coffee  the one on one in person hiring loop  and the panel presentation   The screening process is mostly about finding mutual fit  If you re hiring for a startup  roughly half the time should be devoted to convincing the person to come in and talk to the rest of the team  The caliber of the people you go after and the fact that your startup is probably unknown means you re mostly in sell mode   When it comes to the one on one hiring loop  who you choose to include from your side depends on the size of your company   Let s say you re at a small startup with less than 100 people  You ll want the top PM candidates to speak to your founders  the other PMs on the team  if any   your engineering lead  a design lead  and a business lead   If you re at a large company with more than 500 people  let s say  the rules change  You want these candidates to talk to your VP Product  two to three other PMs on the team  the engineering lead  design lead and business lead   These are the stakeholders that will probably interact with the person on a daily basis  and they ll illuminate different aspects of their experience and personality  In all of these conversations  the goal should be to see how well the person fits this list of criteria   Intellectual ability  Communication  Leadership  Effectiveness within the company culture  Knows what users want  Strategic Analytical Thinking  Technical background  Entrepreneurial spirit  Below  Jackson lists some of the questions he s found to be the most valuable when interviewing product management candidates in person  what he believes good answers sound like  and the responses that should give you pause   QUESTION 1  Product Sense   Name a product that you think is exceptionally well designed   ideally a non electronic product  Tell me what makes it well designed   Testing intellectual ability  communication  and whether they know what customers want    WEAK ANSWER  Something superficial or clich    If they don t go into a lot of detail and say something fluffy like   My electric toothbrush is so great  it s won a bunch of design awards   that s a strike against them    GOOD ANSWER  First  the candidate will get excited to talk about a product they admire  and it will show   One of the best answers I heard was about the Micro Kickboard scooter for kids   I remember the candidate getting really excited telling me all the details   I recently noticed how thoughtfully designed my niece s scooter is  It s the mini scooter that you see a lot of kids riding lately  It s got two big polyurethane wheels in front and a third small one in the back  so it goes over cracks and bumps smoothly and prevents faceplants  Also  instead of handlebars that turn  it has a  lean to steer  design which is really intuitive for kids  teaching them how to steer by shifting their weight  And it s also just super easy to assemble and disassemble basically just two parts that click together     Particularly strong candidates will look at the product from the user s perspective and talk about the problem it solves  In the above example   the candidate spoke about how the users of the product  kids  are actually different than the customers of the product  parents  and all the product design and marketing ramifications of that  which I though was quite insightful   The candidate will have a lot to say and will be very enthusiastic as they speak  especially about the very small details that provide a finished and delightful experience   That s how you know the difference between a passionate product person and someone who just wants a job    To take it up a notch  you can follow up with the question   What would you improve about it   or  If you were the CEO of the company that produced this product  and you wanted to sell 10X as many  what would you do   Look for educated guesses or reasonable assumptions about the market for the product  who the target buyer is  how the market could expand  the constraints of production  etc  Those are the components that should drive the next best step for the product  it shouldn t just be a random idea   Note  It can be easy for PM candidates to prepare for this question  You can make sure they re thinking on their feet by constraining the space they choose from  For instance  the example must be a physical or non electronic product or one they have at home   QUESTION 2  Technical Skill   In as much detail as possible  tell me what happens when I type yahoo com into my browser and hit enter   Testing intellectual ability  communication skills and technical background    WEAK ANSWER  Their response might be rudimentary or confused  You could get an answer like   I see the Yahoo homepage  right    GOOD ANSWER  Something like   Your browser generates an HTTP request  A DNS lookup gets the IP address of the host  The server receives the request  checks for cookies to see if you re logged in  and eventually generates an HTTP response containing the content you should see  Your browser receives the response  parses the DOM and starts to render the page  CSS  images and Javascript are loaded to modify the page    The strongest candidates can answer this question in good detail  taking about five minutes to walk you through the process  This is a good level setting question for product managers so you can see where they stand technically  They don t have to hit every single action that happens  Watch out especially for candidates who say they ve programmed in the last few years but are clueless about this question  That s definitely a red flag   If you think that candidates may have prepared for this type of question  you can mix it up by drilling them on specifics at various junctures of their response  Or you can ask them similar questions about the fundamentals of iOS or Android programming if they have a lot of mobile experience   QUESTION 3  Leadership   Tell me about a time when you disagreed with engineers and designers on your team  What did you do   Tests communication  leadership and effectiveness within the company culture   WEAK ANSWER  There will be allusion to finger pointing  or mention of blame  The tone of their response will be generally negative  and you might see a dip in self awareness  complemented by a spike in defensiveness  They ll be more concerned with smoothing over their role in the confrontation than sticking to the facts   GOOD ANSWER  They ll demonstrate leadership by diagnosing root causes of the conflict  They ll show humility   One candidate told me she couldn t agree with her engineering and design team on one feature   they all wanted to build it and she didn t  She said   Okay let s time bound it  We ll do the idea  but if it doesn t pay off in four weeks  we re going to change it to this other idea   I thought that was a great solution to avoid gridlock   The candidate knew when to push back and when to disagree and commit   A candidate who ends their response by saying what they learned from the situation and how they applied these lessons going forward should get serious bonus points   QUESTION 4  What are all the implications of self driving cars   Tests strategic and analytical thinking and entrepreneurial spirit    WEAK ANSWER  A response that is boring  cursory  or disorganized  They might throw out some obvious answers  like unemployment for taxi drivers  or self driving big rigs  But they won t go deeper into the ripple effects in other industries that will create a whole new wave of businesses  They ll stay in the inner ring of cause and effect   GOOD ANSWER  Showing vision and imagination  they ll paint you a picture of what could happen  Maybe car seats will be arranged in a circle around a coffee table  No one will own cars anymore  which means no one will have garages anymore   I got an amazing answer to this one the other day   Google will open source the software for self driving cars so that any manufacturer can build them  the way they offer Android    says Jackson   I have no idea if that will be true or not  but I thought it was pretty creative    Most importantly  the answer should come packaged in some sort of organizational framework  Maybe they ll say how life will change for drivers  and then the auto industry  and then urban planning  Ideas should be presented within themes  not as a free association jumble   QUESTION 5  What aspect of product management do you find the least interesting   WEAK ANSWER  A PM who complains about doing nitty gritty work  e g  taking notes  scheduling meetings  and implies that these things are beneath them   GOOD ANSWER  A great PM understands that they need to lead from the back  and they relish their role as an unsung hero  The candidate doesn t have to say they love the tough nitty gritty stuff  but they should get points for acknowledging the grungy parts of PM work and why it s important to be in service to the team and mission their supporting   QUESTION 6  Why do you want to work at this company or on this product   WEAK ANSWER   X industry company is getting a lot of buzz  Everyone is talking about it  It s really hot right now    GOOD ANSWER  Clearly passionate about the industry  company or project  Look for specific ideas and plans for what they d want to do and how they want to make things better  This indicates that they really did their homework and have thought deeply about the company  In particular  keep your eyes peeled for long term thinking  which indicates commitment to the industry or type of product  For example  is the person talking about what robots or drones will look like in 5 or 10 years  Or do they just talk about how robots and drones are exciting now  Here are some examples   I ve always wanted to work in X industry  I ve done Y and Z in the last couple years to really prepare for this career move   Company X has a huge competitive advantage because of Y   I have been using product X for a while  and I really like feature Y  I think feature Z could really improve growth engagement monetization and here s why     You want people who are excited about the space  not just this one opportunity   Panel Presentation  After a candidate has made it through all the one on one interviews  you should stop and evaluate  You have the chance to save everyone a ton of time if they re not a good match  So make sure that it s a good fit on both sides  and that everyone s equally excited  before proceeding to the next phase of the process  The panel presentation    I like to ask candidates to come and give a presentation in the office around a conference table for 8 to 10 people   says Jackson   This is a good way to see how they do in a group dynamic  how they present their ideas  and how clearly they express themselves    The prompt he gives them is pretty complex   PART 1  What product or service has launched in the past two years that you believe is particularly revolutionary  What does this product improve for its customers  What about it is well designed  How will the product impact market conditions and the competitive climate in its industry   PART 2  Identify three areas of the product that could be improved  Explain how you would change the product to address these issues and how you d test whether these changes had a positive impact   Candidates are asked to present for an hour with 15 20 slides    I ve seen some really great presentations   says Jackson   A really memorable one was about Class Dojo  which is educational software  The candidate actually set up the environment like a Class Dojo classroom so all the people on the panel got gold stars when we asked good questions  It was really entertaining and interactive  But really you re looking to see how deep the person goes in their thinking  How fluidly do they communicate  Presentation matters  Most importantly  how do they deal with Q A on the spot  because PMs have to be able to handle a constant flow of hard questions    Bottom line  You want PMs who are spokespeople  They have to be able to represent themselves  their work and the work of their teams every day  Their job will be good communication  They have to be clear  organized in their thinking  and quick on their feet   CLOSING THE CANDIDATE  Once you have a candidate you love  it can be tragic to lose them  The close is like a gymnast sticking their landing  It s really what matters in the end  Ironically  the close process starts at the very beginning of your interaction with a person   First and foremost  You need to over communicate and remain in frequent contact with all candidates  They should never feel confused or unsure of where they stand  Be hands on  Don t delegate this to recruiters  Stay involved and available  There s nothing more damaging to candidate experience than someone feeling like your company doesn t care about them   This seems obvious  but there are a few closing tricks that are specific to PMs    I like to think about the reward centers in the PM brain   says Jackson   There s several big ones I can think of  having impact  delighting users  sense of purpose mission  having autonomy  getting recognition  financial outcomes  learning growth  etc  In my experience  more than other disciplines  PMs tend to care most about impact and autonomy    This is unique  Engineers are often motivated by really interesting technical challenges  Designers can be motivated by craftsmanship and feeling of community  Of the reward centers that are important to PMs  one will stand out more for a candidate  It s different for everyone  but you want to figure out what that one  most influential factor is  You can even ask a candidate to stack rank them in order of importance   Once you know what drives them  describe in detail how that will manifest in their role at your company  For example  if autonomy is most important  talk about the opportunities they will have to lead projects on their own  If user delight is most important  talk about past releases that have gotten enthusiastic reception  If impact is most important  talk about how what they ll be doing rolls up to move the needle on a company wide objective    If you can honestly describe to them how they ll get the reward they want most  you ll close some great candidates   says Jackson   Just make sure you deliver on whatever you promised  The only thing more important than hiring the best PMs is keeping them,"[776 426 471 802 1116 46 170 423 24 1092 340]"
787,training-dataset/product/79.txt,product,My Favorite PM Interview QuestionMy Favorite PM Interview Question  I m going to share here one of my favorite interview questions  even though that means I won t really be able to use it anymore  But I ve got lots of others  and I think this is valuable for all product managers to consider where they stand on this  and why   One of the most polarizing topics in product  for many years now  is this notion of whether or not the product manager is  the CEO of the product   and if it s even a good metaphor   In truth  I ve always been conflicted on this question myself  because  oddly enough  some of the very worst product managers I have ever known absolutely love this metaphor  yet it s also my experience that a disproportionate number of the very best product managers I have ever known love this metaphor   And then of course there are many people that absolutely despise the metaphor  and cringe when I even ask them what they think about it   What makes this such an interesting  and I think revealing  interview question are their reasons   Over the years  I ve found that people generally fall into one of three categories   Power  The first group loves this metaphor  because when they hear the phrase  they imagine power  fame and fortune  or at least that s what I think I see in their eyes   They want to be the one that make the calls  They want to be in the room where it happens  Most candidates know that the other members on the team would not actually be reporting to them  but what appeals to them is the influence that they believe  wrongly  comes along with the title   Fear  The second group of people have a viscerally negative reaction to this metaphor because when they hear the phrase  they immediately imagine the pressure the CEO is under  and they want none of it  They say they absolutely don t want the responsibility of being  the decider   They re certainly willing to share their opinion  but to them  either  the team  decides or leadership decides  If being the CEO of the product means they have to handle that much stress  then no thanks   Consideration  The third group doesn t have the visceral response  To them  well  it s complicated  There are some aspects of the CEO role that are very relevant  and others not so much   The obvious way it s not like a CEO is the lack of authority   But they understand that the product manager does need to take responsibility for decisions and they see that as similar  albeit they are usually lesser impact decisions   Most also appreciate that the product manager s job is to understand and balance the many  often competing  needs of users and customers  sales  marketing  finance  customer success  legal  business development  engineering  design  and more  That s probably the most relevant and meaningful part of the analogy  This is actually what I hope people think of when they hear the phrase  It s also  not incidentally  an area where so many product managers come up short   Many candidates will admit to me that they aspire to be a startup CEO one day  or at least a VP Product  and so they  rightly  view the product management role as a proving ground  They think of it a bit as a practice area where the stakes are smaller  but many of the challenges are similar   I still remember the best answer I ever got on this  where the candidate told me that  it really depends on whether we re talking about a strong CEO or a weak CEO  If in your mind  you re imagining a power hungry  dictatorial CEO  then it s not a helpful analogy    So I ve learned that what matters is what s in the candidate s head   I want them to be ambitious  and hungry  and I want them to be confident enough in their abilities to take responsibility for decisions  and I want them to understand they need to worry about all aspects of the business  but I also believe strongly in the importance of humility for a product manager  and I need to make sure they re not thinking the title gives them anything beyond a shot at earning the respect of their team,"[787 1365 98 426 776 1116 802 1131 419 471 909]"
793,training-dataset/product/1020.txt,product,Q A  Can non technical product managers be successful People come into product management from a variety of paths  including design  engineering  customer support and customer success  But are all paths equally successful in transitioning into product   This week we were asked    Can non technical product managers be successful    I don t think there s such a thing as a  non technical product manager    No good product manager is hiding in the corner and hoping all the technology works without ever bothering to learn it  There isn t a good designer that doesn t know anything about engineering  there isn t a good engineer that doesn t know anything about design  and there isn t a product manager who isn t curious and doesn t want to learn new things   As a product manager  90  of your time is spent asking questions  You re trying to learn the perspective of your customers and then actually deliver a solution they re interested in  Whether or not you come from a technical role  it s important that you don t bring in your own perspective and force that on another person  Projects that focus on a single perspective   business driven  technology driven and design driven   have major weaknesses   Design driven  It s going to work beautifully  but it may have no revenue stream  and it might be technically tough to support   It s going to work beautifully  but it may have no revenue stream  and it might be technically tough to support  Technology driven  You re going to come up with something really cool  but people might not be interested in or excited to use it  and again  it may not have a revenue stream   You re going to come up with something really cool  but people might not be interested in or excited to use it  and again  it may not have a revenue stream  Business driven  It may build your numbers  but it s never going to do something like build your brand  and it s never going to be exciting  You re not going to be innovative in this environment   The role of product managers is to blend these three approaches together  Regardless of your background when you transition into a product role you have to give up some of the perspectives you previously championed  You can t have a horse in the game of which is more important  engineering or design  The ultimate focus is the user  Having a perspective driven by curiosity rather than any particular discipline can make parts of the job easier  Focusing on the user will guide you to the right tools for getting their job done  if you focus too much on any one discipline  you will lose sight of more obvious or innovative opportunities that exist in other domains   There are levels of expertise that aren t worth getting  The 10 000 hour rule gets thrown around a lot as an estimate of the time it takes to achieve mastery of a discipline  How should product managers spend 10 000 hours  Spending 10 000 hours learning to code doesn t add to the skill set of my team  I want to spend my 10 000 hours being better at the product discipline  which is about strategy and business  Effective product managers  from all backgrounds  focus on understanding customer problems  how teams work and how to help people communicate better  As a product manager  I focus on the three skills that product managers are uniquely positioned to support   research  collaboration and communication   which ensure that my team is set up for success   Research  To solve your customers  problems  you need to ask the right questions at the right time to help your team identify meaningful opportunities and iterate towards the best solution   To solve your customers  problems  you need to ask the right questions at the right time to help your team identify meaningful opportunities and iterate towards the best solution  Collaboration  Innovative teams continuously share feedback and ideas  integrating divergent perspectives throughout strategy  design  and implementation  You need to help your team learn the most effective ways to get involved at all phases of the project   Innovative teams continuously share feedback and ideas  integrating divergent perspectives throughout strategy  design  and implementation  You need to help your team learn the most effective ways to get involved at all phases of the project  Communication  Authentic  clear communication is the secret sauce of an effective team  paying dividends both within the team and with external stakeholders  Within the team  strong communication creates a safe space for ideation and learning  with stakeholders  it fosters trust and autonomy   Improvements in these areas are a better investment for my team than more specifically technical skills   The most successful product teams I ve been on included people with very complimentary but not shared skill sets  Those teams are great because everyone adds a different perspective  It s one of the reasons product management is of interest to such a wide swath of people  from so many different perspectives and divergent backgrounds   and a hugely positive part of product culture,"[793 1113 142 1131 1345 1116 423 692 381 605

802,training-dataset/product/1255.txt,product,When should you hire your first PM Product Manager Zero When should you hire your first PM   How do you know when it s time to add a product manager to the team  Startups fall into one of several buckets when it comes to product leadership   PM Zero   Product Founder CEO  A founder  usually  but not always  the CEO  is the sole product leader  Sometimes product ownership is shared amongst founders  but one founder is usually the decider  They are Product Manager Zero  Typical challenges  understanding the problem you re solving  getting to product market fit  interpreting customer feedback  balancing product role with other CEO responsibilities   PM One   First non founder product manager  A non founding PM is hired to take on day to day stewardship of the product  They could be a more junior individual contributor or at a VP level  but they ve rolling up their sleeves at this early stage  Typical challenges  knowing when to hire  establishing credibility with the team  the changing role of the Product Founder  relationship dynamics between founders and PM   PM Two   Multiple product managers  As the company grows  more PMs join the team  often reporting directly to the CEO  For the first time product responsibilities are being divided amongst PMs  Typical challenges  knowing when to hire and not over hiring  not slowing down  handling rapid growth  maintaining focus on what s important  figuring out how to divide product ownership   PM Few   Nascent product organization  A handful of PMs become several  now becoming a product organization  usually led by a VP of Product or CPO  Typical challenges  continuing to move fast  communication across product areas  finding the right leader  avoiding distractions   PM Many   Mature product organization  Large organization with PMs of different levels of seniority  often including those at a Group PM or Director level owning distinct product lines or surfaces  Typical challenges  avoiding politics and bureaucracy  the Innovator s Dilemma  maintaining hiring standards  mentoring and growing junior PMs   These aren t meant to imply a necessary progression  not every company needs to go through these phases  nor in this order  In future newsletters I ll tackle the challenges of each of these in turn  Today  let s look at the jump from PM Zero to PM One    The only thing that will wreck a company faster than the product CEO being highly engaged in the product is the product CEO disengaging from the product     Ben Horowitz  Going from Zero to One  In the early days  one of the founders is the de facto product owner  Usually this is the CEO  but not always  Product Founders need full reigns prior to finding product market fit   that s the single most important priority and anything else is a distraction  After you get to market you ll eventually need somebody besides the founder to be the day to day steward of the product  As Ben Horowitz puts it  Product Founders transition  to a process that enables you to make your contribution without disempowering your team or driving them bananas    Please don t think this implies that the founder is  handing off  the product  The best Product Founders will always remain deeply engaged with the product  think Mark Zuckerberg or Larry Page   Their role changes from being in the day to day weeds to being responsible for the longer term direction and vision  Rather than making countless tactical decisions  they re thinking ahead  ensuring integration and alignment across teams  and seeing patterns from their lofty point of view and bully pulpit   How will the Product Founder know when it s time to bring in the first PM  When do you go from PM Zero to PM One  Many of the founders I ve worked with are surprised when my recommendation is often not yet  Usually I discourage them from hiring until they ve found product market fit  But even when you re hitting your growth phase  the danger of having too many cooks in the kitchen exceeds the cost of being overworked  A starvation diet when it comes to PMs is preferable to being overstuffed   Surprisingly  your team may tell you when it s time  although not in so many words  Here are some signals they ll send    You re slowing us down   You have many other responsibilities for growing your business that take up an increasing share of your time   hiring  sales  fundraising  etc  Less time is available for daily product decisions  prohibiting your engineering team from moving quickly  Have mockups been sitting in your inbox for a week  Are you out of the office so much that the team can t get timely decisions  Would hiring a PM increase the team s velocity    You re detached from the details   The team has grown and you re not as connected to the bug queue  user feedback  and technical details  Your engineers and designers constantly need to rewind and start from the beginning when asking you for decisions because you keep falling off the bus to run the company    The rest of our business needs you   Some Product Founders have the opposite problem  they stay buried in the product to the detriment of the rest of the company  They spend too much time with the product and not enough with the business  The product might be cranking but your attention would be better directed elsewhere   hiring  business development  closing customers  marketing  or fundraising   These are symptoms that it might be time to hire that first outside product manager  or as my GV partner and former CEO Joe Kraus says  fire yourself  Since it can often take months to find the right person  better to start talking to candidates now than when these symptoms have become painfully acute  Whom do you hire  Do you go with an experienced veteran who can take on a VP level role  or with someone more junior who won t balk at the inevitable grunt work  How do you set them up for success  Those sound like great topics for future newsletters   Do you have stories  happy or sad  about hiring the first product manager  Let me know   Good Reads  The legendary Bill Campbell believes a product manager should be your first hire  In an interview  he said  you need to add  somebody who can really understand the dynamics of what goes on in a marketplace  apply technology to that marketplace  see how the technology can work  and continue to advise brilliant scientists so they can adapt their products to make sure customers are happy   You really should have that skill set on your founding team  but if you don t  you d better make it a priority   Ben Horowitz elaborated on the Product Founder CEO failure modes in Why Founders Fail  the Product CEO Paradox   Note that it is really difficult to back off of any non essential involvement yet remain engaged where you are needed  This is where most people blow themselves up  either by not letting go or by letting go    Hunter Walk shared his thoughts on when to hire that first PM in Seeking Captain America   Not Captain Crap  Hiring Your First Product Manager   A company who hires its first product manager runs the risk of seeing its culture and tempo slow  Meetings  debate and measurement become part of a previously lightweight decision making process    And finally  Steven Sinofsky weighed in on the topic in Hiring Your First Product Manager   Engineering resources are precious and timelines are always tight being the founder pm bottleneck is no way to iterate your way to product market fit    Following up on PMs and computer

909,training-dataset/product/477.txt,product,The Clever PM   Just Because You re Delighted by Your Product Doesn t Mean Your Users Are There are a lot of potential pitfalls that threaten our success as Product Manager   but by far the worst  in my opinion  is falling too much in love with your own ideas  whether those are problems  solutions  or even assumptions about the market and our customers  While I think they take it a bit to the extreme  Pragmatic Marketing does have a point when they say   Your opinions  while interesting  are irrelevant   It s in our nature to make assumptions and inferences from what we see going on around us   to create plans in the face of uncertainty and to identify potential opportunities that others are missing  But we do so at the very real danger of drinking our own product s Kool Aid and thinking that we have the one true solution and the one truth in the market  But in reality  that s never the truth  and we need to check ourselves every single day against this danger   Remember  YOU Are NOT the User  The single most important thing that every Product Manager needs to remember  and constantly remind themselves of  is that we are not the user   This is an absolute truth   There are no exceptions   I don t care if you were a user  or if you  use  the product in your day to day life  or if you founded the damn company  The minute you step behind the magic curtain  the minute you have an interest in the product as a business  the minute you start working on the product   you cease to be the user  Your interests almost immediately stop reflecting the day to day needs of your users  and rightfully so  As Product Managers  we have to make tough decisions about our products on a daily basis  and these decisions will almost always start to create a gulf between your interests and the interests of the customer and the user   We must be aware of this and maintain our perspective and the best way to do this is to ensure that you re keeping that perspective is by testing your ideas with actual users  Sure  stakeholders are a good proxy for users  and if you ve got a services team  they re a decent substitution   but nothing will give you the insights that you ll get from having real users review your ideas  your mockups  your prototypes  and your solutions while they re in progress  There s a reason there s such a focus on experience in this day and age   and we have absolutely no excuses for not getting real user feedback given all of the myriad options available to us   Don t Assume You re the Smartest in the Room  Another issue that many Product Managers have in relation to their products happens when we take our role as the  voice of the customer  too seriously   and without taking into account the actual voice of the customer  see above    I ve worked with a few Product Managers who took themselves and their role way too seriously  and refused to actually listen to what people were trying to tell them  missing the nonverbal cues that indicated the questions they needed to ask to dig deeper  and simply assumed that they were right and there were no other viable options   because they re the Product Manager   I hate to break it to these people  but obtaining the title of Product Manager  or Designer  or Planner  or whatever you call yourself  does not endow you with any special mystical powers or abilities  You do not automatically become some Oracle able to divine the future  You are not some wizard capable of creating something from nothing based solely on your will  You re a conduit for ideas  problems  and solutions that your users communicate to you  through whatever means you have available to extract them   We are not the only people with contacts in the market  we are not the only people who understand what our users need and want  we are not the only people who are allowed to come up with new ideas  Sometimes the best ideas and the best solutions come entirely out of left field  from people you might least expect   Identify Your Assumptions and Challenge Them  In my many  many years of being a Product Manager  I ve come to the conclusion that the greatest sin that prospective Product Managers might actually not be thinking that they re the customer  I know  I know   that sounds like a contradiction based on what I talked about above  but stick with me  The fact is  even when we act like we are the user and make decisions or judgments based on that context  we can still correct ourselves if we realize that we re making assumptions   and challenge those assumptions  This is the most important tool in our belt to correct behavior throughout the organization   but it starts with ourselves  Figuring out when you  or others  are making assumptions  and being very clear about what the basis of those assumptions is  allows us to be diligent in our decisions  It allows us to identify the things that we don t yet know or don t yet fully understand  It clarifies the questions that are actually important and separates them from those that are merely interesting   The better you can be about understanding when  how  and why you re making assumptions   and to challenge them and validate them with actual users  the better a Product Manager you ll be and the more invaluable you ll be to the organization   And not because you know everything  or because you re right all the time   because you know how to drive to the correct decisions   The Clever PM The Clever PM has been a B2B product manager for over 10 years in a variety of industries

works at IT Central Station as the VP of Product Management  Her areas of expertise include leading content  community and social teams in order to achieve their goals through optimal execution strategies  Lea prides herself in bringing inspiration and motivation to each and every one of her teams through her unique leadership methods and she was kind enough to share some of her success tactics with us   Q  Please share a little bit about yourself  your background  specialty  and what motivated you to enter the field of product management     A  I ve been in Product related roles for 16  years  I m currently VP Product Management at IT Central Station  leading platform for Enterprise tech reviews   Before that I was the VP Product at Roomer Travel and Fiverr com  and I was director of Product at BillGuard and Answers com  This list of companies expresses that I have experience in different types of industries  eCommerce  travel  FinTech  UGC and more   building great products on different platforms  desktop  mobile  tablets   for different types of customers  B2C  B2B    I entered this world as a web content editor  when the web was just about static HTML pages  I was fascinated by this new world called  The Internet   My Google handle is  hagoleshet  which I got way back then  which in Hebrew means  The surfer   from the days when we surfed the web  I was very involved in the websites we built  and later on learned more about building applications  and the rest is history   Q  As a product leader  what tactics do you like to implement in order to make sure that your team is as productive as possible during the development process   A  Communication processes will make or break collaborative work  I make sure that the Product team and R D have the right tools to plan and execute development as defined in the Product Roadmap and pre sprint planning  More importantly  I make sure that everyone is communicating effectively  regularly and empathically  We should all be on the same page in terms of Why and What we re trying to do  achieve company goals   They are accountable for the How and When   Q  What advice would you share with new product managers owners  What information do you wish someone had shared with you when you were first starting out   A  I actually wrote two relevant posts about this topic   What I did wrong as a Product Manager  and How to become a top 1  Product Manager   These posts highlight areas that I learned to notice the hard way  Being a product manager is an extremely difficult job  People from the outside tend to look at it as a fun job with lots of control  In fact to be successful as a PM you need to excel in many areas  both creative and analytical  You have to be goal driven but at the same time people driven as well  You can get lost in the chaos  being pulled in many different directions within your organization   I also think that people don t take their own professional growth into consideration as they get bogged down with work  Your growth is a win win for you and your organization  Don t forget to think about it and push for it  In most cases  your manager won t do it for you   Q  Where do you look to for inspirational and revolutionary ideas   A  The world is inspiring  You just have to open your eyes and ears to it  I read a lot  every day through sites and influencers I follow  I make sure to read about areas that are also different in industry and technologies  Innovation usually comes through making original connections  rather than expanding more of the same  I stay current in technology and marketing trends   This is part of what makes me excited about my current role where I help build the leading platform for marketing Enterprise tech through peer reviews and social activities  This is a marketing channel that is getting more and more attention from B2B marketers looking for new ways to connect with customers   Q  Please identify a few common mistakes you ve observed throughout your career made by product owners and their teams  and how they can be avoided    A  The biggest mistake I see people make in their role as Product Managers is focusing only on  Product  and less about being a  Manager   This is a leadership role even if you re just starting out  Your personal skills are the greatest tool you have to become a successful PM  You can easily learn and improve your technical skills   But without knowing how to effectively lead people on your team  lead developers who aren t on your team  and be perceived as a leader by your management team   you ll have to work very hard to build wonderful products  In addition you ll have to extra hard at becoming a product leader within your space  and you ll probably be stuck in personal conflicts and frustrations   Q  How do you ensure a successful product launch  What are some personal touches you like to add   A  A successful launch will happen when the process was effective  keeping all stakeholders in the loop early on and throughout the development cycle  When there is ongoing communication between everyone involved  clearly sharing when  what and how progress is made  Emails go out before  during and after for clear follow up   I make sure to include shout outs to relevant people who stand out  along with giving kudos to people who help make it happen  Recognition is important and helps people become motivated to be part of the team  It also helps management see who the key employees are who are mentioned often   Follow Lea on Twitter for

990,training-dataset/product/341.txt,product,Minimum Viable Product Manager   The Black Box of Product Management   Medium1  The Stack  When engineers refer to  the stack   they re talking about the layers of technologies that are used to provide functionality to your product  i e  make the thing work   From the moment a customer loads your landing page to when they delete their account  the technologies in the stack handle everything   Fastest way to learn   Ask an engineer to take you through the stack at a high level  Write down the names of each technology  Quick Googling of those terms will teach you some of the high level benefits and trade offs of each technology chosen  and how they work in harmony together  Stay at a high level because you can fall into the rabbit hole easily  add  trade offs   benefits   vs  to your search query   How does this make you a better PM    When engineers are discussing how to build something  terminology flies around the room  Knowing the stack means you can at least follow along  and over time you ll begin to understand what depth in the stack they re referring to  Generally  the more layers in the stack they need to touch  or the deeper the layer  the more complicated and risky a change will be  Knowing this may push you to re consider a different way to solve the problem   2  System Architecture  If the stack represents what technologies are being used  system architecture represents how those technologies are structured to work together to deliver the product  Whereas the stack is mostly about raw technical capability  the architecture of a product incorporates the customer s intended behaviour in its design   Fastest way to learn   Ask an engineer to draw you the architecture  You ll get something like this    Why are there only two of the thing called triple store    First  don t panic  Ask them to walk you through what each component  box  in the system does  Some will handle internet requests  some will house the  business logic   others still will hold the data that is saved  cylinders    Second  believe it or not  this is very useful for you   How does this make you a better PM   When you understand the architecture  you start to think of your product like a system  which is generally how engineers will as well  Having an understanding of how each component in the system contributes to the whole helps you make better decisions and trade offs   Generally  the components in the system that have the most connections are the most complicated to change because so many others rely on them for data or functionality  The more components you have to change in order to complete your build  the more dependencies you have  and the harder the project will be to execute   In larger companies  the number of components you touch is often synonymous with the number of teams groups you need to interact with  and the more alignment you ll need to gain to execute a project   3  The Data Model and its APIs  A data model organizes information used by your product and standardizes how pieces of that information relate to one another  By  information   we re really talking about things like Users  Products  and Credit Cards  which collectively are called entities  These entities can relate to each other in certain  structured ways  for example a User can have many Products  but only one Credit Card   The data model is closely related to the system architecture in that certain entities  live  in certain components  Your Users model may live in component A and so might the Products data  but because of its sensitivity  Credit Cards live in component B  If your feature needs to show which Users own a product in a list  that s pretty easy since they live in the same component  But if you need to know which of those users have a credit card stored  then component A needs a connection to component B in order to share the data  That s harder  and to accomplish it  they need an API  application programming interface    APIs are built on top of the data model and represent how any two components talk to each other and exchange information about their underlying models  Importantly  APIs also let you talk to external components  When you call an Uber from Google maps  the Google maps app is talking to a component from Uber  Most applications have Public APIs and Private APIs  which are usable by anyone on the internet  or just those you specify  respectively  Knowing your public APIs are critical to understanding how your product can interact with the outside world   Fastest way to learn   You should focus first on gaining an understanding of your Public APIs  They re usually easy to find  and often live on your website s developer docs  When you see them  you ll see code and that may or may not freak you out depending on your background  but if the documentation is half way decent  that should be irrelevant and you should be able to read it fine  The beauty of studying your APIs is that they often represent most of your underlying data model  so you get two birds with one stone   How does this make you a better PM    Knowing your data model expands your ability to know what information you can utilize to create better products  and how hard it may be to access that information  Knowing your APIs mean you understand what types of information partners and third party developers can get from your application  and therefore what types of integrations are possible  The extensibility of software is one of it s most valuable properties  and being able to work well with other products  that your customers are potentially using everyday  is quickly becoming table stakes   4  Where you shouldn t focus  Programming  Don t get me wrong  I love programming and it does help you be better  but unless it s a highly technical product  you just don t need it to be an effective PM  If you find yourself coding as a PM  you may need to ask yourself if you re actually doing high leverage work  or you re not sure what else you should be doing  That being said  I think it s a very worthwhile and fun experience to have built at least one app and shipped it to a production environment   1  Project Management  Boring  I know  I hate it too  but it is really important  If you can t run a project well you re never going to be a good PM  Period   Fastest way to learn   This one is hard  To be an effective project manager takes a lot of experience and time  You can read up all you want  but at the end of the day it s a human behaviour problem  It takes time to learn about the spectrum of personalities you ll end up working with  and any advice you ll find on how to approach it is often subjective to your personality  too   That being said  there are some software specific things you can invest in to accelerate your learning curve   Understand the basics of product development so that you can empathize with your team  Learn about version control  Git   collaborative programming  GitHub   Quality Assurance processes  and at a high level how and when code gets deployed to users in your product  Learn about the common problems that plague software teams  and the processes others have developed to try and solve them  You ll come across things like agile  scrum and kanban  There is value in learning the philosophies behind their approaches  whether your company uses them or not  Understand decision making at your company  and map out your stakeholders  These are often your customers  your boss  your team members  bosses  and other PMs  Find a way to ensure that everyone is aware of the status and direction a project is going at a level contextual to what they care about  you ll have to find that out too    How does this make you a better PM    You ll get more shit done with your team  and people will enjoy working with you because everyone hates a poorly managed project   2  Modelling Impact  Things that aren t measured rarely get done well  Every product should have quantitative goals that are tied to it s ultimate success  basic things like user growth  feature adoption  revenue  etc   When your team is debating the highest leverage thing you could build next  it s important that you can develop a model of how the product will move the dial on those metrics   Fastest way to learn   It s time to get your spreadsheet on  A good model clearly shows two things   The unit economics of a product and the assumptions that create them   How much does it cost to acquire a new customer   How much does it cost to serve the product   How much does a conversion move the needle on your goal   The forecasted impact and the assumptions that create them   How much does this product move the needle over the next year  The next three   How many people will we need to hire to enhance and support it   How are market forces like cost reductions  inflation  and competition accounted for in the long term  Gotta love that fake model growth rate      How does this make you a better PM    The exercise of building a model for your product is a great way to test your instinctual assumptions and ensure that your product has enough potential to make it worth doing  It makes your job easier too  by enabling you to justify projects in a way that resonates with your stakeholders  and by easily enabling you to compare the opportunity cost with other projects you could be doing   3  Gather   Analyze Data  Being able to independently gather data is vital to making quick decisions  For all but the most involved analyses  relying on someone else to get data for you is not only an inefficient use of their time  but it also doesn t lead to insights  because anyone who s been an analyst before knows that insights come through iterative exploration of data  not some perfect report you dream up   It also reduces your ability to make data informed decisions when they matter  Almost everyday  a decision about how a product should behave in a certain scenario will pop up  and having data to support a decision makes it easy for you and your team to feel confident in the right direction   Fastest way to learn   Your goal is data independence   Whether you need to write SQL queries or use a drag and drop interface depends on the data infrastructure at your company  Regardless of what it is  you need to invest in learning the tools available to you  Google them   How does this make you a better PM    When data is easily accessible to you and you re comfortable getting it  you will use it more and it will enable you to be more iterative  Whether you re considering what to build next  or you re seeing how your launch is doing  you will build a reflex to use data as an important input into your decision making   and better products will result   4  Where you shouldn t focus  Take this from someone with a business degree   don t waste your time making strategic business cases  3 year plans  and other MBA artifacts  I won t go as far as to call it bullshit  but it s not the way to succeed in software  Understand the vision  find a problem worth solving to achieve it  build a hypothesis to solve it  and then validate it as quickly as you can with real customers  Rinse and repeat   1  Know the design patterns of your product  Most products develop design patterns over time  whether planned or not  Patterns are the consistent use of the same visual and interactive components in your product  All text on buttons are font size 25px  all forms must be no more than 3 fields  every time an error happens we will make an explosion sound and send the user an email with the details   these are all patterns   Random example  Material Design on thenextweb com  Knowing your product s patterns are critical in understanding how users map your product in their minds  and how they can effectively be given new features over time  If you usually give users a green button saying  Add New Feature  when you launch something  and this time you switch to an orange button that says  Blow your mind   you will confuse the shit out of people   As a product grows  consistent use of patterns becomes even more important because they enable teams to work independently of each other but still build a product that feels cohesive   Design patterns are also usually developed in harmony with technical patterns  like style guides and components  which are basically libraries of re useable code that speed up teams because they don t have to re design or re implement the same functionality again   Fastest way to learn   Talk to your designer  they should know these patterns cold and  hopefully  be able to give you links to a style guide  Also talk to your front end engineers  they can equivalently give you links to a pattern library   How does this make you a better PM    Plainly put  designing products on pattern is far easier and faster  They let you stand on the shoulders of design decisions your team made in the past  decisions that result in a product that s easier for customers to use  If you ever need to break existing patterns   to be clear there sometimes good reasons to do so   be prepared with very good reasons why it s necessary for the long term health of the product   2  Know how to execute user experience research  PMs are supposed to be the voice of the customer  If you don t understand your users  you will never build great products  From interviewing a single person face to face  to quantitatively analyzing millions of user actions  understanding the basics of good research are imperative to your job   Fastest way to learn   Effective research is a very big field  so instead of sending you into the rabbit hole  I recommend you focus on understand the following   Understand Sample Size and how to calculate statistical significance  How to normalize your sample and why that s important  How to ask unbiased  non leading questions in surveys and interviews  How to synthesize results and avoid bad conclusions  How does this make you a better PM    By consistently and frequently testing your product with customers  you can take away a lot of the guesswork  and risk  in product development  Before a project even starts  you should be testing to validate that the problem you think you re trying to solve really is one  While you re designing and building  you should be testing that the product s design is easy to use and is likely to solve the customer problem  After launching  you should be validating that the problem was solved for the customers you wanted to solve it for   3  Know how to prototype your ideas  Prototyping in this context means being able to create visual mockups that can effectively express your ideas  They need to be good enough so that you can   Communicate a product concept clearly  It is incredibly difficult to communicate a product experience verbally or in writing  A prototype  something people can see and preferably interact with  you can do this without code   is 10x more effective   There are two reasons for this  first  it forces the articulation of the product in terms of what customers will actually interact with  and second  because humans naturally think visually  a prototype levels the playing field so that everyone on the team can speak the same language and give their points of view effectively   Unblock a team when design is behind or absent  In most projects  it is important that the product s design is ahead of development  Designers try to  stay ahead of the devs  because the switching costs for developers is much higher once they start building the product in a particular direction   Because so much of product design is iterative and done in parallel with the build  when there s a setback  e g  user research says the design is not effective  design can quickly fall behind  It s in those situations that a PM must be able to roll up her sleeves and be a  design intern  for the lead designer  helping to push pixels and ship mockups so the engineers can continue the build   Fastest way to learn   I won t spend time justifying this  but just start using Sketch  it s like MS paint and Photoshop had a baby and it s awesome   How does this make you a better PM    By prototyping and showing people what you re thinking instead assuming they understand  you will get better feedback from your team on your ideas  and reduce the risk that mis communication leads to wasted effort  Also  it s nice to be able to actually produce something tangible once in a while   4  Where you shouldn t focus  Don t focus on being a great visual designer  Your ability to make a slick looking interface is redundant and disempowering to someone who s spent a career learning the deep craft that is product design  Unless you re design savant  to be clear there are some   you also probably just think you re good  and you actually suck   MVPM  I don t want to trivialize learning all this stuff  It s not easy  and it takes a lot of time  so tackle it bit by bit and enjoy what you re learning  I hope this helps you

1013,training-dataset/product/239.txt,product,What is Product Management The role of product management in technology firms is a critically important one that is often misunderstood I ve done product management at Microsoft  LinkedIn  and various startups  though my product management experience during my years at Microsoft  where it s called program management  were the most formative and I continue to leverage those lessons to this day  especially when advising new product managers on how to think about their role and where they should be focusing their time Product management boils down to owning the vision  design  and execution of your product While the amount of time spent in each of these areas will vary by the company as well as by your seniority in the organization  the vast majority of your work will always fall into one of these areas  And while the scope of your product can also vary from a small feature to the entire product strategy for a company  the core discipline remains the same Let s take each of these areas in turn and talk about what exactly it takes to excel at them Owning the vision for a product involves clearly formulating and then evangelizing the audience you are targeting  the distinct problem you are solving  and your unique solution by which you will win the market To formulate a compelling vision for a product you need to have a deep understanding of the target audience  the existing solutions and competitors in the market  and a compelling thesis for why your solution provides a 10x improvement over the existing alternatives An important lesson that I learned early on is that formulating such a vision is only half the battle  The equally important aspect of your role is evangelizing that vision to your team  Before you can convince your team of your vision  you need to start by building strong conviction within yourself that your vision will win in the marketplace  Without that it will be impossible to convince your team  Once you have that  it becomes important to craft your vision into a compelling narrative that your team can get behind  And then you need to focus on delivering this message continuously to your team so they never lose sight of it Your strategy can change over time and it may require updating your vision  But it s important to stay and reinforce the course until new information becomes compelling enough to suggest otherwise  Constant flip flopping can be detrimental to team morale and your ability to inspire them to achieve a shared objective Owning the design for a product involves determining the right feature set to achieve your 10x improvement over existing solutions  working with designers to ensure the user experience appropriately delivers on the vision and principles by which your product will differentiate  and authoring detailed specifications that guide developers to efficiently implement the finalized design In many ways the hardest part of design is the prioritization exercise that requires determining exactly what is above the line for the next release  This requires an equal amount of art and science to come up with a compelling feature set and user experience  What I most often advise is to err on the side of fewer features for the benefit of getting the product out sooner to optimize for learning  And fewer features also enables you to spend the time to appropriately optimize the experience for the remaining features When working with designers  the most important contribution that you can provide is a deep understanding of the user s goals  sensibilities  and psychology  plus existing behaviors and tendencies that the user has already exhibited via an understanding of the existing product metrics  This enables you to ensure the experience is appropriately calibrated for the exact user you are going after Owning the execution for a product involves doing whatever it takes to ensure your product ships  This involves core project management responsibilities of breaking down the roadmap into concrete tasks  tracking the progress of these tasks  and triaging bugs and feature suggestions as they come up But most importantly  it also involves being resourceful in solving any blockers that come up for your team  This could be filling in the gaps on your team when needed  including design work  copy reviews  or even simple engineering tasks  Or it could be ensuring open product  design  and technical decisions get resolved in an efficient manner  Or it could be responding in real time to industry changes  competitors  or customer complaints It s equally important for you to constantly think of ways to improve the execution cadence of the team  This often involves process changes to how the project is managed  how decisions are made  and the environment in which the team gets it s work done  Optimizations in the execution cadence of the team often are the most fruitful way to ensure a greater impact for your overall product and as the product manager you are best positioned to optimize it So while the daily responsibilities of a product manager are often diverse  the role boils down to owning the vision  design  and execution of your product,"[1013 302 1116 121 1092 340 1099 423 1131 605 793]"

1022,training-dataset/product/655.txt,product,Product Management Survey Results 2016139 Flares 139 Flares    Our universe is expanding  More than 1 200 of you took part in this year s Product Manager survey  double the number who took part in our survey three years ago  It s growth that is mirrored throughout the product manager community  and we see the effects directly at Mind The Product   in the increasing number and greater popularity of our conferences  ProductTank meetups  and in subscriptions to our hand curated newsletter   Closing the gender gap  And like any other expanded community this year s survey results bear witness to a greater diversity  There now look to be more women in a product management role  We see a 7  increase in the proportion of female product managers in the last three years  and they now account for 35  of respondents  This growth reflects our own experience and anecdotal evidence over the last three years  and Marty Cagan s keynote at this year s  MTPCon London really highlighted the fact that we should be working even harder to build more diversity into our product teams   Our survey respondents are now more geographically diverse than they were three years ago  while the majority still come from the UK and North America  this year we can also throw South America  Africa and the Middle East into the mix  We believe this reflects the development of the product management community and greater recognition of the role that product managers can play within a business  rather than being due entirely to expansion in the reach of MTP   More seniority  In this year s survey 38  of respondents had a Product Manager job title  down from 46  in 2013  The number of Senior Product Managers responding this year rose to 18   up from 15  three years ago  Median experience in 2016 is four years  and is unchanged from 2013  but mean experience  as you might expect from the increased proportion of more senior respondents  has risen from 5 years to 5 4 years   Salaries have gone up in the past three years  although we think that the salary data for 2016 is a little  noisy   Globally  the average salary for a Junior Product Manager in 2016 is  54 700  up from  47 400 in 2013  The average salary for a Product Manager in 2016 is  82 900  up from  77 600 in 2013  The jump in salary between Junior Product Manager and Product Manager remains large   at around  30 000   as it has been in previous years  Salary levels for Head of Product and Senior Product Manager are again broadly similar this year  In the past we have assumed that this is because there is little or no differentiation between these two roles  but alternative theories are very welcome in the comments   Equity and lines of reporting  Equity shares remain a popular means of remuneration  Overall in 2016 49  of product managers are receiving a share in the equity of the business as part of their remuneration package   up from 42  in 2013  In 2016  42  of UK respondents receive equity as part of their remuneration package  in the US this figure is 59   Remuneration for product managers in the US is higher than elsewhere   There have been changes to lines of reporting for product managers in the last three years  More product managers now report directly to the board or CEO  and fewer report either to the VP of marketing  CMO or different business owners than three years ago  Specifically  in 2013 49  of product managers reported directly to the CEO or board  whereas in 2016  56  of product managers report directly to the CEO or board  In 2013 9  of product managers were part of marketing and 15  reported to different business owners whereas in 2016 the percentages are 6  and 11  respectively  Does this mean that product management is becoming more widely recognised as a distinct and important discipline   This year s distribution of company size shows most of the respondents coming from companies between 50 and 500 employees  The distribution of company size in 2016 follows a similar pattern to previous years   with a drop in the number of respondents in companies between 500 and 1 000 employees  and then rising again for again for companies between 1 000 and 10 000 employees  As in previous years we see no obvious explanation for this   In summary  The product management community is expanding and maturing  The gender gap is closing  our salaries are going up  our collective experience is increasing  and product managers are reporting in greater numbers directly through a product management function in their organisations  This all points  we believe  to product management being more generally recognised as a distinct and vital discipline   or as our co founder Martin put it at this year s  mtpcon London   product management is more important than ever   Let us know in the comments how the survey data and our interpretation reflects your reality and your organisation   or what you think will change in 2017,"[1022 382 24 98 1365 192 302 356 338 802 1092]"
1032,training-dataset/product/458.txt,product,Are You a Naughty Or Nice Product Manager 60 Flares 60 Flares    It s that time of year again   No  I don t mean financial planning or strategy reviews   I mean it s a chance to reflect on what we ve achieved  how we ve achieved it  and think about whether we re being the best product person we can be  As the craft of product management evolves  and we learn more about how to build products that people love  we need to be able to adapt and evolve at the same time   Sometimes practices that were crucial when we started our careers have been superseded  and sometimes we all fall victim to  business as usual  and we forget to step back and look at the bigger picture  Wherever you are in your journey as a product manager  and especially if you re hoping your team might get you a little something to delight you this holiday season  it s worth taking a moment to consider whether you re on the  naughty  or  nice  list this year   Signs you might be a Naughty Product Manager  It s not always obvious  but you might be a Naughty Product Manager  If you re not sure  here are some clear indicators that you might not be in Santa s Good Books   It s PRDs all the way down  Product Requirement Documents made sense in the age of waterfall  and arguably still do make sense in certain  highly specific niche cases  However  everything we ve learned in the last few years points to leaner  agile  more experiment based product development processes being more efficient and more effective  At worst  if you re still using PRDs  you should accept that they are at least subject to change  But if you write PRDs  and expect them to be followed to the letter  then you might be a Naughty Product Manager   Less talking  more shipping  You ve done some initial research  or talked to a few key stakeholders  or even convinced yourself that you re representative of your customers  You re tired of all the stalling and hand wringing and debating   you just want the team to do something  So you use your considerable powers of persuasion and rhetoric to convince everyone that you know exactly who your users are  and what s driving their behaviour  so you don t talk to bother talking to them anymore   let s ship some product   Except  the chances are that you don t fully understand your customers  so if you re convincing your team that you do and that you don t need to talk to users anymore  then you re probably a Naughty Product Manager   If the client asks for it  we ll build it  There s listening to your customers  and then there s building whatever they ask for  One is great  and the other  not so much  If every feature request and every urgent dev plea from a sales rep with a  huge deal on the line  ends up on your product backlog  then where is your product vision  How do you define your target audience  If this sounds familiar  then you re not pruning out features to define your product focus and   congratulations   you re no longer a product company  You re a custom development agency  Which means you re also a Naughty Product Manager    I love my stakeholders  From afar   I know  I know  stakeholders can be a real pain  They keep pestering you for information and decisions  and they need so much attention and hand holding before they get on board with your Grand Vision for the product   Or maybe you re just not working with them effectively  If you understand your stakeholders  and work with them to get everyone aligned towards a shared goal  i e  not necessarily the goal you like the best   they ll fight for you  support you  and help you get the information you need  In the world of agile  cross functional teams and product design experiments  if you re not working closely with your stakeholders  then you might be a Naughty product manager   Tips on how to be a Nice Product Manager  Hopefully we all aspire to be a Nice Product Manager   to work well with our teams and customers to build the best products we can  to refine our craft  and to feel good about ourselves along the way  Here are a few things you should bear in mind along that journey   Respect your users  As we re all probably aware  there is plenty of well understood science that tells us how to manipulate and direct our users  attention  We may or may not be able to use that knowledge in our own products  but should we   If you want to be a Nice Product Manager  you should recognise that your users do not exist solely to be your customers  design your product to respect their attention  and have an elegant UX that lets them achieve just what they need   Say  no   but do it well   An essential part of being a great product person is being able to say  no   You ll have no shortage of feature requests  suggestions  ideas  possible development work  but to build the right thing you need to be able to pick the tiny selection of possible work that you should be focusing on  Of course  saying no  and the debate that inevitably comes before and after that  leads to conflict  Not all conflict is bad  but there is a lot we can all do to manage it more effectively  direct it towards positive outcomes  and focus on learning rather than winning   Empower your team  If you lead a product team  then arguably your team is your product  But no matter where they sit in the hierarchy  a Nice Product Manager is keen to empower the people around them so that they can build great product  Whether you re working in a cross functional team  or just communicating with stakeholders from all across the business  the team you work with cannot act on your behalf if you haven t empowered them   Share your vision  share your knowledge  work with your team to build  learn and share the wins you all create   Get out of the building  Remember when we said that assuming you completely understand your customer is a sign that you might be a Naughty Product Manager  Well  the only way to avoid that and get yourself on the list of Nice Product Managers is to Get Out Of The Building  go and talk to your customers  and listen to what they can teach you  You can learn a lot from analytics and surveys  but never kid yourself into thinking that you can build a product that people will love without actually talking to those people   Share what you learn with the community  We re all part of an awesome and growing community of people who are passionate about building great products  and we re learning new lessons every day as we re surprised by our users and work out hugely effective new ways to work  The Nicest Product Managers share what they know  get involved in the community to help their peers and  if they re keen  get up on a stage to share their experiences and lessons,"[1032

companies make during the product development process  and gives advice on what can be done to prevent them   The post   5 Biggest Mistakes that Startups Make Without Product Development   originally appeared on CodigoDelSur s Blog and has been republished below with permission   After 10 years in the incredible and exciting position of helping startups all around the world in the creation of their projects  I think that we are in good shape for indentifying some common mistakes that are repeated over and over during the product development process  and obviously  because presenting a problem without a solution is not our style  how to avoid them and not die in the attempt   And to be clear  this list is not only about mistakes that we ve seen once or twice  they re mistakes that are much more common than what you might think   Something that we are proud of  and certainly makes our task dynamic and entertaining  is the diversity of companies that we have had the chance to collaborate with  from the creation of Skout  a dating social network that has over 220 million users and is in the top 10 apps in the App Store  and Kindara  a fertility tracking app with over 1 million users and one of the most successful companies among the thousands from the Founder Institute   1  Focusing on Technology Instead of the Product  Ok  I m going to start with the one that might be more surprising  coming from us  a company that s actually been the tech partner in the development of many products  But the reality is that our role  the role of tech partner  what technology we use  what libraries  what SDK  is a secondary role when it comes to creating a product   You might ask   but how is this secondary if it s a digital product    Yes  it is secondary  The main thing is what functionalities it is going to have and which ones it will not  what type of users it points towards and which others it does not target  what problem it resolves and which one it does not   A typical example is the product owner that tells you that his application has to support millions of users  has to have an extremely high performance  low latency  etc   but without yet having solved which will be the basic functionalities of their MVP  what problem the app will solve  why would someone use the app and not the other 100 existing out there   My advice for avoiding this mistake is  as a dear ex boss once said to me and really changed my vision about technology and its role  Technology is a tool  not an end  The end is the product  The technology that is used is simply a tool for creating it  and although it is very important  focusing on what tool to use and not focusing on what you want to build will not lead to success   2  Thinking that the Idea is More Important than the Execution  And I m hooking the last phrase of the previous item to start this next mistake  Founders often give too much importance to the idea and too little to the execution  They invest a lot of time and money in signing an NDA  being jealous with how much information could be revealed about their idea  etc   Guys  I have some news and a piece of advice  there are already at least 10 apps like yours  The advice is  execute it better than them   However  as obvious as it is and no matter how much it is repeated and how often we see memes in LinkedIn about this matter  this misconception repeats itself once and again   Avoiding this error goes hand in hand with my previous advice  Relax  you don t have the idea of the century  What you can aspire to is to be the executer of the century  Share your idea  validate it with colleagues  mentors and customers  receive feedback  and build the app knowing that there is another huge group competing with you   3  Not Focusing on App Marketing  The days where  I ll make a hell of an app  publish it  the Apple review guys like it  they feature it  people download it a million times  I get 20 million in investment  the app becomes famous and I become rich  are gone   Nowadays  it doesn t matter if you have an app that solves a gigantic problem  if the app provides a user experience that is out of this world  that is developed following the latest technologies   if no one knows your app  it will die in oblivion   A lot of times  entrepreneurs are too focused on the previous aspects  which are important  but totally leave aside the marketing of the app  They continue with the idea of over 10 years ago where an app would become famous just because it was good   The reason is simple  10 years ago there were hundreds of applications  Today  there are millions  and every one of your competitors dedicates more time and money to having their app  and not yours  discovered   Our advice here is to designate a budget to marketing and promoting the app that is simial or equal to the budget assigned to developing the product  In the app world  it doesn t matter how good your app is if no one knows about it   4  Wanting to Skip Steps in the Development Process  Being an entrepreneur is not easy  You have scarce resources  a lot of places that need those resources and above all  anxiety to see something up and running  Frequently this anxiety will encourage you to skip steps in the product development process  with the adverse idea that skipping steps means accelerating the process   Like everything in life  the creation of a software product has countless unique methods and steps  The certain thing is that one has to exist and be respected   At CodigoDelSur  we use the agile methodology  Its basic principles are short iterations  which adds value to the product and early market validation  among other benefits   The typical steps  which should not be skipped  are the stage of product approach or  discovery phase  that generally takes about two weeks  where basically we  think out  the product  Then  the stage of UX definition  where we define the look and feel of the app  as well as the user experience  the flow between screens  where we generate a front end that is non functional  and then  the development of the MVP  Some stages can be done in parallel  but none of them should be skipped   It s common that entrepreneurs let the anxiety of  seeing something  win them over with the idea that this will bring them faster to the result for less money  In reality  the general effect tends to be the opposite   what you don t pay in the beginning you end up paying at the end r esulting in fixes  modifications  and even major re engineering that could have been avoided if no stages were left out   We always respect the product creation process and do our best to remind our clients of the importance of it   5  The Expectation of a Fixed Price and Fixed Timeframe  I left the worst of the most common mistakes we see when speaking with potential clients for the end  as it s also the one that is most difficult to explain why it is a mistake   99  of the time clients come to us with an idea  a few pages with some details about it  and after a 30 minute meeting they expect that we tell them how long the project will take and how much it will cost   Again  even when you read this written  plain and simple  you might say   This can t be possible  people can t pretend this    believe me  it happens  Wanting to have a fixed price for the development of a new project is as idealistic as it is useless   This is an ERROR that our clients make  not a problem that we  as providers  have  As the creator of a product  I would be VERY worried if a possible provider estimates the cost of my idea  which I might not even have a clear vision of  in a fixed time frame and cost  Quite simply  THEY ARE GUESSING   This has only one outcome  someone will lose  and in general the one that loses is the product  either by having less functionalities than the ones it needs  or not being flexible in the incorporation of changes  or not having the quality that is needed  The creation of a new product is an ongoing process  and that is how it should be approached   Am I saying you should start the development of a product without having any idea how much it will cost  Of course not  but you should not expect a fantasy plan of exact times and costs based on pure intuition that will work exactly as envisioned  This is part of the risk   In conclusion  find a partner whom you trust  make sure you know about their reputation  contact their past clients  talk with them  and get an approximate idea of the costs  and not one based on promises    CodigoDelSur is an

1092,training-dataset/product/606.txt,product,5 Paths To Your First Product Manager RoleThe most common question I get from aspiring product managers is how to land their first product manager role  Unfortunately it s not an easy question to answer because there isn t a single straightforward path into product management  but instead a variety of paths from which product managers typically come from  I wanted to share the five most common paths that I ve observed for individuals landing their first product management role and how to increase your chances of landing the job through each path These are certainly not the only ways to get a product management role and I know product managers that don t fit into these archetypes  But since they are the most common paths  it s helpful to see if you can fit into one and leverage it to land your first role  This is also not a commentary on how an employer should hire PMs  but simply a reflection of how hiring in fact happens for product roles in tech firms today  There is a separate post that could be written on the ideal hiring process for PMs  but we ll save that for another day So let s jump into each of the five common paths into product management Large tech firms do hire entry level product managers typically into a 1 2 year Associate Product Manager program  complete with training  mentorship  speakers  and often rotations across a few different product teams  Google popularized the program concept and it is now common across large tech firms like Microsoft  Facebook  LinkedIn  Yahoo  Yelp  Uber  and more  It s a great way to learn the ropes at an established tech firm with structured learning and mentorship  Additional tech firms hire entry level Associate Product Managers leveraging similar criteria  but often into a far less structured program The challenge is landing one of these roles  Most employers are typically looking for recent computer science graduates with top grades from a top computer science university  like Stanford  Berkeley  MIT  Carnegie Mellon  etc  They typically streamline their university recruiting programs to specifically recruit from a dozen or so schools to fill their APM program pipeline Simply graduating from one of these top programs with good grades is not enough  They are specifically looking for a set of skills on top of those evidenced through computer science programs  Specifically  they want to ensure strong leadership  communication  and analytical skills  From a leadership perspective  they are typically looking for natural extraverts who can get along with just about anyone  They ll be looking for evidence of leadership from  say  your college extracurricular activities  In terms of communication  they want to make sure you are clear  succinct  to the point  and can make strong compelling arguments  And finally  for analytical skills  they want to make sure you understand the math behind dashboards  A B testing  etc  This is where your stats class is more interesting than the computer science math classes that you typically have in computer science programs  So make sure to brush up on these skills as well as find ways to evidence them in your interview Another common path to entry level product manager roles is having an undergraduate degree in an engineering field  often computer science  but not always  as well as recently graduating from a top MBA program  like Harvard  Wharton  Kellogg  Stanford  Haas  etc  Folks from this background are often hired into large tech firms with a Product Manager title instead of an Associate Product Manager title  though I ve seen both titles used  These students are attractive to employers because they not only have technical foundations from their engineering background  but have rounded out that experience with business fundamentals that are helpful when thinking through product and business strategy  Many MBA programs also are analytically rigorous  often through finance and stats classes  ensuring students come with those skills  Additionally  MBA students typically have a few years of work experience under their belt  ensuring they know how to get things done in a corporate setting The students that standout from this background are ones that can parlay their work experience between their undergrad and MBA into a strong narrative for their desire to move into product management as well as specific skills and experiences they have had that are relevant to a product role  Similarly they often leverage their time as an MBA to exhibit their entrepreneurial talents  either starting something on the side or working alongside others in internships  part time  etc One of the best ways to land your first product management role is to work with product managers inside of a tech firm in an adjacent role and then leverage that experience to parlay it into a product role at that firm  I ve seen designers  engineers  marketers  customer support  sales  and business operations managers all leverage this as a path into product management  The goal here is to find an adjacent role that you are qualified for that works closely and regularly with a product manager  These are often roles that are part of the broader R D team  They then knock the socks off the product team that they are working with and become an indispensable part of the product team To make this successful  you then have to find opportunities to take on more product oriented tasks and responsibilities in your adjacent role  Maybe it s writing a spec for a small feature related to your area  Or maybe it s running point on a project  These experiences then create proof points for the product management leadership team that you could potentially take on the role and since you ve been an absolute rockstar in your existing role  the willingness to give you a try as a product manager  The key here is parlaying that adjacent role experience into a product role at the same employer  It s much easier to do this than seek a product role at another employer because the team knows you well and will leverage that trust to take a shot on you  This same trust and evidence doesn t exist when going to another employer  though it s certainly still possible to land a role that way This path works in both large and small tech firms  The large tech firms often have many different roles that work with product  creating lots of opportunities to work with product managers  They also often hire significant product managers so they have open roles available  Startups are another great path for this given how roles are more loosely defined and they are usually more willing to move people around with limited previous experience when needed to attack whatever is the most crucial project at the moment You also see many previous startup founders ultimately in product management roles  Many tech startups have both technical and non technical co founders and I ve seen both types of co founders end up in product roles  As a startup co founder  you either have direct responsibility for the product or indirect responsibility given that the team is so small  And this direct experience serving informally as the product lead for your startup ends up being highly relevant to the product management role  Entrepreneurs also typically have a broader view on products  since typically in a small team that are worried about all parts of the product s success  including user acquisition  engagement  monetization  and so much more  They are also usually very familiar with making things happen and the details of execution because more often than not they are directly participating in many of the aspects of pulling the product together  They also typically have opportunities to showcase their creative thinking in the very fact that they are working on a startup that hopefully is differentiated from the status quo of the market s offerings While these attributes reflect positively on why an entrepreneur could be a strong product manager  an entrepreneur has to combat some challenges of coming from this background  First  often startups are moving so quickly that they don t typically leverage product management best practices in developing their products  Flying by the seat of your pants are not the attributes employers are looking for when hiring product managers  so they want evidence that you are familiar with and can leverage product management best practices in driving a product  As an entrepreneur you typically wear a hundred hats  so it s also important to evidence that you have specifically worn the product hat with some rigor  Most startups also fail and that s fine  but you need to have learned something from that startup experience and be able to tell a strong narrative around it to parlay it into a product role I ve also seen domain experts in an industry or specific vertical be able to leverage that experience into a product management role at a tech firm that specifically specializes in the market of their expertise  For example  I know a sales operation manager who was able to leverage that experience to become a product manager at a sales related software startup  I know an MD who was able to leverage that experience into a product management role at a health care startup  Or someone with a Masters in Education that became a product manager at an EdTech startup  Employers are hungry for real experts to help take their product to the next level and thus are open to looking beyond those with typical experienced product backgrounds The key here is not only being an expert in the field but establishing your reputation as such an expert  Blogging  attending and speaking at relevant industry events  and knowing the other thought leaders in the space are all ways you can do this  The more niche the field is and the more relevant it is to your target tech firm  the better  You need to stay on top of the field and the application of technology to the field in order to keep that expertise relevant  And you want to leverage that thought leadership to create a network of connections and relationships with folks in the field and potential employers you want to join I hope this gives you a look into some of the most common paths into a product management role  While certainly not the only way into a product role  you do increase your chances of getting a role when you can align with and optimize a common path into it  And hopefully you can leverage some of these tips to help you land your own first product management role,"[1092 302 24 605 1340 192 802 356 98 1365 426]"
1099,training-dataset/product/893.txt,product,Product Management vs Project Management  What s the Difference  Are you a project or product manager  What s the difference  Aren t they the same thing   Product managers and project managers are asked this question all too often  To some  these two words are interchangeable  but not to the individuals who work in this field  Now it s time to solve the  product management vs project management  saga once and for all   It is all too common for people to mistake product management for project management  They assume the two roles are one in the same  that a product manager can do a project manager s job  and vice versa   However  there are many more major differences between each role than people may think  A project manager s role is focused on internal and tactical  while the product manager s focus is external and focused on the customers  and on the product strategy   Product Management vs Project Management  Project managers oversee the development of the product  utilizing three main tactics in order to successfully manage their team    First is risk management  which includes assessing and managing potential risks    Second is resource management  which involves making sure the team has all the materials they need    Last is scope management  ensuring that the team manages their time and costs correctly   Product managers have a whole other list of responsibilities which extend beyond the lifecycle of the product  Their responsibilities reach outside the office  as they are highly involved with meeting the customers  needs   This includes researching what their clients expect from their product  defining the product vision and strategy  and overseeing the interaction between various other departments such as sales  engineering and marketing   Although these roles are very separate  there is occasionally overlap within companies because their responsibilities both involve managing and overseeing the product development process   In order to avoid the overlap which could lead to a lack of efficiency  there are many strategies companies can implement  however it is up to each manager to stick to their own tasks  If they do overlap  however  it is important to have open communication between the individuals so productivity isn t lessoned,"[1099 356 24 192 302 1092 580 1131 121 98 1365]"
1102,training-dataset/product/225.txt,product,Things Nobody Told Me About Being a Product Manager297 Flares 297 Flares    Shaun Russell shares his journey into product management  sketching out the well trodden path he took to getting started   reading  taking workshops  learning from peers  and so on  But being a product manager is really hard  and nothing can prepare you for it  There are things that nobody tells you  so Shaun explains what he s learned along the way   The Importance   and Challenges   of Looking After Yourself  Your work is intangible   It s hard to describe what you do  and it s hard to grasp when things are going well     It s hard to describe what you do  and it s hard to grasp when things are going well  You are forever embracing uncertainty   don t underestimate the toll this will take on you     don t underestimate the toll this will take on you  You are supposed to know less than your colleagues   You have to champion your colleagues  but that means you can t champion yourself     You have to champion your colleagues  but that means you can t champion yourself  There is no finish line   Your product is never  done    To learn about how other product people worked  and what kind of issues they wrestled with  Shaun shadowed product managers from two very different companies  He learned both that these challenges are universal  and ways of taming them   Friendships are Important  It is crucial to find people who will listen to you talk about your work  who will try to understand you  and who will learn how to ask questions about your challenges  It s easy to avoid talking about these things  but that s a very lonely path  and great products are built by great teams   Find Your own Meaning  The solution to any existential problem  You need to create a really clear idea of where you want to go in your career  and be specific  Ask yourself questions that help you define  with a high degree of specificity  what it is that makes you unique   now or in the future   as a product manager   The Trouble with Stakeholders  The age old challenge of product manager   managing stakeholders  There are a few things that many new product managers may not realise  but which they have to accept about their stakeholders   Your relationship is not reciprocal   They will think they know best  and the burden is on you to prove otherwise    They have long and selective memories   They will give you all the responsibility  but none of the power   The nature of stakeholders means that there are a few key things to remember when working with them   Confront Issues Head on  It s tempting to smooth ruffled feathers and avoid conflict  but if you don t confront issues with your stakeholders  you are effectively incurring  stakeholder debt    they will become used to getting their way  It s essential to establish a clear relationship early on  and make it clear that you serve the customer first and foremost   Make use of External Validation  You have to work twice as hard to convince people of your point of view  and that often means coming at issues from different angles and using different communication tools  Shaun suggests using external sources of validation to help sway people to your point of view  such as perspectives from product leaders that your team respects and which back up your argument   Occasionally  Remember to go With your gut  Sometimes   just sometimes   gut instinct trumps  or at least informs  data  Make space for it,"[1102 1032 1116 605 381 1131 46 1345 1113 793 692]"
1113,training-dataset/product/371.txt,product,Learning in Product   Ellen s BlogChances are it s more like your skills are consolidated into one of the three buckets  based on what you studied and or did before PM   That s a fine elevator pitch of your job  but it isn t a fine way to approach your own learning  Almost no one is equally strong in all areas   most people fall into a flavor   It s really tempting to say you sit at the middle of Technology  Design and Business  This is what most people assume Product Managers are   First  you need to figure out where you are as a Product Manager   Since those are basically how you learn anything  I ve broken them down in a way to think about it for Product in particular  This guide is hopefully a way to go from Product 101  which we ve got covered  to Product 401    I ve been experimenting  Here s how to get better at Product in four easy steps   We lack content on  how to get better  and I think it s because everyone does it differently  Companies define it differently  it reports to different departments  and Product Managers have widely divergent backgrounds  Career ladders don t all look the same  You d need more than a lifetime to learn every skill that might be useful   Too much Product content still relates to  what is  Product   ugh    how to get into Product   ok cool  but then what   and  do we really need Product anyway    double ugh    This obviously isn t a perfect model  I d lump anthropologists more towards the design bucket  I d lump data scientists more towards PMM or Engineer  It depends  You can fill in the circles for yourself based on which skills you have  Here s a piece that outlines some example skills in each area  As you grow  each circle will become fuller    That s where most people stop when they think about how to set their baseline as a PM  There s two other components   The one nobody talks about is how others currently perceive you   When I first started working  I had a piece of paper that said  engineer   This meant my engineering skills were always vastly overestimated  and my design skills were typically underestimated   The perception matters because it can impact what work people give you  how they will judge your performance  and how much they will trust the results  It may not be worth your time to prove someone  wrong  if they ve decided you re bad something  even if you aren t     or it might be absolutely critical   Then  to use a phrase I hate   soft skills    There are a ton of so called hard skills that go into Product   using SQL  running a great user interview  figuring out pricing  Yet  more so than in other disciplines there are interpersonal things to keep in mind   Is your team motivated  Are you good at keeping the team motivated   How much do people  like  you   management  peers  subordinates  Can you manage up down out   How strong are your written communication skills   I cannot emphasize how much these things matter for how you re perceived as a Product Manager   So before you decide what you want to learn  think through these three things to figure out what you re good at  and what you aren t good at   Business Design Technical Skills Others  Perception of your skill set Interpersonal skills  You aren t going to be good at everything  but that doesn t mean you aren t good at Product  There are plenty of things some people would say are  crucial  that I still can t do   Decide what to learn next   Once you know where you re at  you need to decide what to learn next  Here s four angles to try    1  Where do you struggle now   The easiest way to know this is  my boss asked me to learn to X  or  my boss says I have to get better at X   but things usually aren t that straightforward in Product   Instead  I try to look at it for myself  I ve been a long time fan of Josh Elman s work on a Product Manager s job   The weird line breaks are mine  it ll make sense in a second   I think this is the single best way to assess if you re doing your job as a PM  If you aren t already sold on that  go read that piece and come back  and if you haven t read it before  go read it    If one of those pieces feels weakest  chances are there s something you can do to do your job better  I bucket them into Product areas   So then you can dive into it to try to figure out a smaller aspect to learn first   If your Product team doesn t feel connected to the company  are you missing an aspect of business strategy  How do your metrics align to the overall metrics  Do you talk to the sales team enough  Have you done a sales call to see how it goes and build empathy   It s okay the thing you want to learn is broad   even as broad as  I have no idea what finance is     2  Where is the company is going next   Sometimes there isn t a big issue at work  Sometimes it feels like the team is going smoothly   That s a great time to try to intentionally learn something  If you want to it to help the company  it s also a great time to break out the Wayne Gretzky sentiment    Skate to where the puck is going  not to where it is    If you ve got one  you can skip to deciding how to learn it    3  Play to your strengths   Sometimes you aren t in a job  or aren t particularly interested in learning something to make that job better  It s good to have ways to decide what to learn that aren t just related to your job   I think the most fun way to learn  and probably the one I do most  is based on what I m curious about   This is a pretty popular technique  It s more likely you ll stay motivated to work on it  It s also been shown that people are hired for their strengths  not for their lack of weaknesses    4  Address weaknesses   That said  addressing your weaknesses can still be a valid path  Especially if they re interfering with other growth   For a long time  I felt really anxious about getting development environments set up  Actually writing some code  fine  Getting ready to write code  thinking about writing code  not so fine  I made it my new year s resolution so I d be forced to be more comfortable   Recap  There are at least four good ways to figure out what to learn next   Where you struggle now  Where your company  or just you  is going next  Reinforcing your strengths  Reducing your weaknesses   Once you ve figured out what to learn  you have to figure out how to learn it   Decide how to learn it   Once you ve figured out what you want to learn  you decide how to learn it  Unfortunately most PMs skip straight to this step   Instead  ask yourself these five questions  based on what you ve decided you want to learn   Each of these is a spectrum  If you have your idea in mind  I d draw out five spectrums so you can put an  X  on them as you go through this   Informal vs  Formal Learning  One end of the spectrum is  I m an autodidact  I can teach myself anything   The other is  I like to sit in a formal classroom with an expert    Personally  I lean far more towards the right  I wish I was great at teaching myself things  but I do better when I m accountable and have resources available   Tactical vs  Strategic Knowledge  If you wrote down before that you don t know what finance is  I said it was fine   that s more a strategic problem  You probably want to understand the underpinnings of how to think through your business model  or how to make money  If you wrote down something like  I need to do payroll this month  that would be tactical   Strategic is a way to add another perspective or another way of thinking to wha you e doing  Tactical is more likely to solve a problem in the short term   Adjacent vs  Not  It is easier to learn things that are close to what you know  Let s say you wrote down before that you re very strong in running A B tests  You also just heard a talk about multi arm bandit tests  That s directly adjacent to what you were doing   Now say you said before you were good at A B tests  but you wrote down you wanted to learn how to do a good user interview  Not adjacent   How much do I need this   I think of this as a spectrum between  nice to know  and  mission critical    If you decided to learn something for pure interest sake  doubling down on strengths  and it doesn t seem like it ll impact you in the short term  that s towards nice to know   If you don t think your product will succeed unless you figure this out  that s mission critical   Do I need credibility   Last one is if you need credibility or not  In some working environments  being able to  do the work  is enough  In others  you need a formal degree to get the title or promotion you want   Putting it together   Once you ve drawn this out five times  you end up with a picture like this for your skill  Let s say I d written down  Building a Financial Model  back in 2014  pre MBA   I personally like to learn formally  Understanding how to make a product make money  vs  be something people liked  was more strategic  It had nothing to do with what I d done before   engineering and design  It was pretty important to me to become a better product leader  To some extent no one wants a spreadsheet that you just made up  Having some credibility when you make a financial model is nice   Only once you ve gotten here should you start trying to figure out the right place to learn  This is the last possible step in deciding how to learn   I bucket the ways to learn into five major areas   It s not just about reading the list and deciding what sounds best  Each will be better depending on the type of thing you are trying to learn   An MBA was a good way for me to learn how to make a financial model  but only because I like learning that way  it was a big new area for me  not like anything I d done   and I thought it was important  That s not going to be the case for everyone   An MBA would not have been a good way for me to learn to manage  That was done much more effectively by a combination of actually managing a team  new job  and self directed education    Should I get an MBA   isn t a question   It s an answer to  How can I learn to make products that people love  AND generate sustainable enterprise value    Repeat   As soon as you feel confident in your new knowledge and skills  you can start this process over again  I ve taken new jobs  I ve gone to school for all of the  core  product disciplines   engineering  design  and business  I ve taken other  unrelated classes  I ve asked for advice from friends and mentors  I ve read books  I ve used everything I learned so far and tried to teach it to others to see how applicable it was  All of it has helped make me the PM that I am today   If you take one thing from this  as a Product Manager  please never ask yourself  do I need an MBA   or  do I need to go to a code bootcamp    Instead  ask yourself    What s the best thing I can learn next  How can I learn that most effectively    This framework is the culmination of my entire career trying to learn about Product   Found it helpful  I d appreciate your support  one week only   for my next set of writing,"[1113 1345 990 1116 471 793 426 776 605 1032

1116,training-dataset/product/778.txt,product,Interview With Brian Crofts of NamelyThis post is part of a series of interviews that we are conducting with product leaders across various industries  In this interview series  product leaders share their advice with their fellow product managers  We hope this series will shed light on trends and challenges in the profession  and be helpful to new and experienced product managers alike   The following is a conversation with Brian Crofts  VP of Product at Namely  Namely is a fast growing  all in one HR platform  Before Namely  Brian held a variety of product management and finance roles at Intuit  Here s Brian s story   How did you get into product management   Brian Crofts  BC   I started my career at Intuit as a corporate finance intern  Like most people  I didn t go to school for product management  I studied economics and finance and discovered PM later  I considered several career paths after college  but in the end  I chose to stay in finance   Early on  I saw a product manager on stage at an Intuit all hands and I thought   that guy has the best job   The product manager was a great story teller  He articulated a clear customer problem and had deep empathy for the customer s pain  He then shared his vision on how to solve that problem  in a compelling way  I knew I wanted a career in product  A year later I was building my first mobile application   We solved big customer problems at Intuit   we built software to help consumers feel confident about doing their own taxes  for example  We were tackling that kind of customer challenge guided by a specific business model   working with great designers  and the best engineers  As a product manager being at the intersection of the customer  the technology  and the business  in my mind  was the closest thing to being a general manager   A lot of people describe the product manager s role as the  CEO of the Product   What do you make of that moniker  What leadership challenges do you think product managers face   BC  Leadership can be a hard thing to define  My prior CEO always said   Your title makes you a manager  but the people decide whether or not you re a leader   I think that makes a lot of sense  Generally speaking  people want to be led  In product management  you lead by understanding customer pain  and advocating to solve it   driving towards the best idea  and then ultimately building that solution in a timely manner  Engineers  designers  and the team want to solve the problem  and at the end of the day  they are looking to be led   Being a leader is not the same as being opinionated  It s about the desire to  get it right   not just  be right   And while many people are working IN the business  it s important as a leader to constantly working ON the business  These statements can be cliche  but they ve always mattered to me  And the combination of the two is when we move from people working hard every day to working towards something that really matters   and is customer driven  data backed  Do that day after day  year after year  and the probabilities of success dramatically improve   Tweet This    Being a leader is not the same as being opinionated  It s about the desire to  get it right   not just  be right     Being a leader isn t something that just happens  it s something that you develop over time and by experience   by succeeding and failing  It s action oriented  We follow people who have a vision  who make decisions  and who move   What do you love about your job and what is the most challenging part   BC  Earlier in my career  it was all about launching new products  And that was fun  But it was a new process for me and I didn t have much confidence  Like anything  it s been a maturation process  And so those first few times  it was so exciting just to get a feature released or to get a new product launched   and see customers using them   I think it s so true in every aspect of life  You get to a point where you can look back  reflect  and ask   What was the best part of that experience   There s of course a big payoff when you launch something and people really love it  but if you didn t enjoy the part where you were solving the problem   where you were working with customers  and poring over spreadsheets  and looking at data  and trying to synthesize it into insights  Eric Ries calls it  the photo montage     then you re just not going to be a good product manager  If you don t like that part  you should find a different gig   I have much more confidence in the process   and a strong point of view on what that process entails  Today  I get just as much satisfaction seeing the members of my team develop as leaders as I do launching a new product  For the most part  my team is my product   As far as the most challenging aspect of my job  I think it s surprising how much of the job demands effective and efficient communication   To be a successful product manager  you need to communicate not only what the vision is and what it is we re building  but why we re building it  Read Simon Sinek s Start With Why  And because we re agile and because we re always changing  and constantly getting new data and insights  it becomes imperative that we bring stakeholders along  This often requires some kind of cadence or op mech within the company   I use ProductPlan to help facilitate the communication of what we re doing  when we re doing it  and ultimately  why we re doing it  As a cross functional team  we review the roadmap together every month  In the earlier days of my career  I underappreciated the communication aspect of the job  But at the same time  if I had just done it effectively  I would have had an easier time   more time focused on building  I used to spend all my days managing stakeholders   and that s not right  There s a balance that needs to be struck  and we re doing that here at Namely   One of the first things I worked on when I got here at Namely was reimagining how we communicate both internally and externally  That involves getting different tools  different processes  and getting people aligned trained on the new way  When it comes to customers  our communication also needs to be agile and contextual  and non obtrusive  These are things that people don t typically think about   they think product management is just about building products  But it s so much more   How do you manage conflicting priorities within your organization   BC  There s a three part answer to this  First  teams need to operate under guiding principles   principles the organization is aligned to  For example  availability  compliance  security are usually the top of the list and are highly prioritized   That sounds easy  but it can be difficult once you get past the  non negotiables   Soon after joining Namely  our CTO and I worked to get aligned with the other leaders on how we d prioritize our backlog  It required aligning first on our product vision and strategy   Apart from aligning on principles  it s important to bring data to the discussion  The most ineffective meetings are those when decisions get made  or missed  because the loudest person in the room influences everyone else  Meanwhile  key insights and data points have the answer  or can at least aid a decision  For example  your data may show that users are dropping off at the top of the funnel  and nobody s converting past the homepage  so why are you debating the user experience later on  What does it matter if there is no conversion  Good data and insights can open up the conversation and keep it objective   And finally  when I say make customer backed decisions  I mean bringing empathy back into the process and reminding people why we re doing what we re doing  I think that can also help unstick people when it comes to conflicting priorities   It s also really important to understand the role of escalation  If there is a debate amongst leadership  it s ultimately up to the CEO to be the tie breaker  That s a role our CEO plays and an example of how effective escalation can be  It isn t always a democracy   the reality is we need to make decisions  I think understanding that is very healthy  Escalation is not a negative thing  it s just about getting to decisions so that teams can commit to those decisions and focus on execution  Our CEO plays that role well here at Namely   What tools or software can you not live without   BC  I ve learned to love a good whiteboard and marker  I have one on wheels  so I often take it with me  I ve got one whiteboard out here in our working area  and I ve got another one that sits right by my desk  I like whiteboards because ideas seem to flow when jotting them down  I do most of my writing there  I ve still yet to find a good  digital whiteboard  for online collaboration  I know they exist  but nothing I ve incorporated into my toolset   I also use Evernote  but mostly for sketching  I use Evernote   iPad to sketch out everything from new org charts to product sketches to sketches of my presentations  I usually will sketch out my whole deck before I actually put it together  similar to building a product    I view everything as a product   whether it s a deck or whether it s a team  The idea is that anything that s early stage needs to be lower fidelity  I used to have a Moleskine notebook  but now that I have the iPad Pro  I mostly use that   For example  I ll sketch out a deck in Evernote  go over it with our CEO  and make real time edits without ever having committed anything to PowerPoint  That kind of rapid iteration process   going from low to increasing fidelity as I get more solid on the answer   that s how I operate in every aspect of my life  Even my goals for next year are written in Evernote  Not typed  but written with my messy pen because it denotes the lower fidelity  Eventually  those goals will end up nice and typed out in Evernote  and then in our Namely platform   I think all of these tools are pretty common for product managers  it s how we use them differently that s probably the more interesting  I ve got four or five Trello boards  for instance  I use them for personal to dos and admin to dos in the business  and then I ve got more strategic level boards  I even have a family board where my kids actually have little things to work on  The high level  Kanban format gives me a sense of understanding of what s going on and what we ve got coming up   Describe your organization s roadmap planning process  How far out do you plan   BC  Like I mentioned earlier  the first step was getting everybody aligned on how we re going to prioritize  Then we simply shared those prioritization principles with the team at an all hands meeting  and talked through the high level game plan and how we as the leadership team were aligned  Although it was very high level  there were decisions made  We were more explicit on what s in what s out for this next year   After we distributed the product vision and principles  the teams came back and shared their first draft of their roadmap  We pushed them a little bit on vision  We asked if it was aggressive enough  We made sure it was core to our platform  etc  The best part was seeing how collaboratively these teams worked across design  product  and engineering   and then collaborating with the rest of the business for feedback  It showed in the final result  the team s roadmaps were very much in line with our strategy   We focus on six months at a time  say 90  confidence for the stuff in Q1 and 60  confidence for Q2  In ProductPlan  I use milestones to show the beginning of the quarters  and on there  I actually write the percent level of confidence  This is our way of communicating with marketing for example to say   Hey  this is what we re going ship  but don t take it to the bank   Marketing would never look at Q2 features and communicate them to prospects in any way  but they at least know where we think we re headed and they can give us feedback on it   Tweet This    The worst thing is becoming beholden to a document that was wrong to begin with    It might be the case that we don t ship what s on the roadmap  I think the worst thing is becoming beholden to a document that was wrong to begin with just because that s the nature of how we work  So that s something we re trying to break up  In years past  it was like   Here s the roadmap  and success for everybody means shipping everything on the roadmap   But ultimately it s about getting closer to solving our customer s pain  That is how we are measuring success   That s our approach   and I think it s pretty similar to how we did things at Intuit  I m taking some of the best practices we had previously  but also realizing I can move even faster here at Namely   How do you incorporate customer feedback into your roadmap   BC  Here s the thing  Usually  when customers give me feedback on stuff  I already know that it s broken or that the user experience is bad  It s either already on our roadmap  or it s not because it just hasn t hit the priority list yet  We have work constraints and limited resources  so everything on the roadmap has been prioritized  and there obviously has to be a cut line somewhere   But the thing that steers the roadmap more than anything is customer insights  What I mean by customer insights is actually spending time with customers and observing how they use the product  and how they solve problems using a variety of tools   even what they do with paper   Going onsite  in their office  and actually observing what customers are doing is so much more valuable than just listening to what they say   If I m on a phone call with somebody  I can t see their environment  Let s say I m working on document management  and I m talking to someone about how they use document management software  I m listening and I m thinking they re probably paper free  but then I go on premise  and see they have all kinds of file cabinets  That leads me to my next step of discovery   Having the contextual references and seeing their environment can lead to insights  When you watch them use your product  in their space  you see their stress   you see how they feel and you see the emotional side of it  Whereas on the phone they might just tell you   Yeah  I use it  It s a good product    What are some big mistakes that you ve seen product managers make  or mistakes you ve made yourself    BC  One mistake I made happened not too long ago  when we had just launched the French version of QuickBooks  During the setup experience  or the first time user experience  there was a period where the app would stall and spin for over a minute  It was a terrible user experience  and I remember coming onto that team and thinking   Ugh  that s not very good    But then I got caught up in the day job  Even though I knew it was not a good setup experience  I just accepted the status quo and focused elsewhere   As a product manager  you need to be the person that advocates for good design and a good product  or nobody will   Tweet This    As a PM  you need to be the person that advocates for good design and a good product  or nobody will    It took an embarrassing demo with a customer and a senior executive to bring it back to our attention  We all looked at each other and knew we could only blame ourselves for accepting the status quo  So that s a trap that I ve fallen into   and I ve seen others fall into as well  At the end of the day  we need to be advocates  We need to advocate for the customer  and for great user experiences  and for great products  We need to always be raising the bar   If you could give only one piece of advice to a new product manager  what would it be   BC  We ve talked a lot about making decisions and leading  but I think product managers who really excel are those who also find a way to build hand in hand with engineers and designers  We can be builders too   Product managers should understand what it means to be a builder  That may mean learning to become more technical  or it may mean learning how to lead design thinking  It s important to establish that role as you lead   A PM who is more technical usually pulls their own SQL queries to better understand customer usage trends  In doing that  you re gathering information that s helpful to ensure you re building and investing in the right areas   Design thinking is the process of developing deep customer empathy and insight  and then building something that customers will love   and that s being a builder as well  It s not just about writing good user stories or setting a good vision  It s about actually getting your hands dirty and building  sketching out designs  observing customers  sitting in on sales calls  This is the right step in the evolution of product management   I would advise aspiring product managers to develop those skills  In your undergrad  learn how to code or learn how to design  Even if you ultimately want to become a product manager  you need to have technical chops   and you need to know how to actually build stuff   You have been involved in bringing new products to market for quite some time  How has product management changed over the years   BC  I think macro shifts used to happen every 3 5 years  but now they seem to be happening every six months   whether it s the sharing economy or the gig economy  The world and its markets are changing faster  You look at all the newer companies that are driving the highest value  and they re all network effects  Airbnb doesn t own a single room  Uber doesn t own a single car   Even ProductPlan   you re shifting from a feature based approach to more of a platform  You now are spending more time building the pipes  because those pipes   and being at the center of those pipes   are actually much more valuable  You re bringing much larger ecosystems together than if you just built a point solution   This was a criteria I used when deciding which startup to join  I wanted to build a platform  And that is what we are doing at Namely  We have our core products  but we are becoming more of an open platform to connect 3rd party apps  It becomes a platform that is personalized to fit each of our client s business needs  We are early in that journey  but are making great progress,"[1116 1131 142 1365 98 381 46 692 990 1113 605]"

1131,training-dataset/product/1359.txt,product,Define Your Product Management Mission Statement with Eric Stover The product manager is the champion  the evangelist  the strategist  the voice of the customer   Eric Stover shares his vast knowledge on strategic product management  and sheds some light on the genius behind his data driven decision making capabilities in this exclusive interview   Eric is currently the head product manager at Autodesk  and specializes in various fields such as general management  developing customer focused products  strategic planning and product life cycle management  He provides us with a unique and creative outlook on how to create a successful product while managing a functional and happy team   We are flooded with buzzwords lately such as paradigm shift and synergy  where do you think product management as a whole is heading   After 20 years in a variety of product management type roles  I ve seen plenty of new processes  ideologies  technologies come and go  all meant to help the product manager and her his team be more effective  bring product services to market faster with higher quality  and be closer than ever to the customer   My view of product management is that you are on a journey with your customer  As a product manager  you will have endless new technologies circling around you to make your job more efficient  you ll have new techniques for engaging the end user of your product  and there will be no shortage of ideas and opinions on best to rationalize and interpret the requirements from your extended team   No matter the business you operate in  no matter the latest tools and techniques available  the product manager will continue to operate as the CEO of their product  Regardless of the size of the company you work in  no matter how big your staff is or the size of the team  you are responsible for the successes and failures of your product  The product manager is the champion  the evangelist  the strategist  the voice of the customer   You will continue to build trust amongst your teams  ask them to spend their most important resource  their time  to join you toward a common goal of addressing the customer needs  As a product manager  this is your mission statement both now and into the future   Let us in on some of your secrets where do you look to for inspiration  For innovative and revolutionary ideas   I ve made the equity markets a hobby of mine for more than two decades  Nowhere else can you get a detailed view of every industry in the world  from financials  consumer staples  pharmaceuticals  technology  sustainability  even material sciences  it s all here   The market is like a vast library of the here and now  and each company s position on the foreseeable future  Pick up an annual report from your favorite firm  it s amazing the amount of knowledge and vision captured in these documents  I ve learned more from disrupters lie Amazon s utilization of drones to deliver packages  Tesla consolidating Solar City to become a major end to end energy service  the understanding use of genomics for personalized medicine  to name only a few topics just by listening to the markets  All of this knowledge influences my day day dialog with my team   Another not so secret is that I dedicate time to getting out of the office and meeting with peers  I utilize friends and social networks to reach out to others who are working on topics I find fascinating  I never allow for  quick questions   rather  I prefer to have deep meaningful dialog with people  which also makes me a liability at cocktail parties    I m a great listener  I love to hear people talk about their passion over a lunch or even a coffee  Even when I m not on the clock  I find means to talk with interesting people  Ever take an Uber  I really enjoy listening to the motivations of the drivers  why drive strangers around every day  What other jobs do they have  Part of the product management experience for me is that I get to trap them for research for the duration of my ride  a full interrogation   Lastly  a real benefit of living in a metropolitan area is that I live down the street from two major universities  Stanford and Berkeley  Every quarter I make it a point to attend one of the many free lectures seminars the schools host one a wide variety of topics   Remember how I like to follow the stock market  The lectures hosted by these schools help me make sense of what I m hearing in the corporate world  Since both have a wide variety of disciplines they teach  I can typically learn more about any topics I read about as the schools tend to host leading edge dialogs across a wide spectrum of subjects  I would highly recommend getting in touch with your local school  University  College  JC and Trade School   it s amazing the kind of knowledge you can immerse yourself with  Never mind the great networking   Based on your years of experience  what have you observed to be some of the most common mistakes product managers make  How can they be avoided when managers are often struggling to juggle numerous tasks   I ll start by pointing my finger in the mirror for each of these thoughts below  I ve learned some hard and valuable lessons in my tenure as a product manager  Hopefully some of this knowledge will be helpful   First  when was the last time you actually met the customer face to face   I thought so  This is the easiest thing to deprioritize    I have survey tools     I can interact with my users on Twitter or a discussion group     I see some users at our annual show    By not spending some time directly with customers  we often miss the nuance if what problem the customers are truly trying to solve  I ve seen surveys used as a proxy which tend to lead the audience to the conclusion the team wants to hear   When you sit with the customer and walk a mile in their shows  you really can get to the bottom of the problem that needs to be addressed  Having that experience alongside the customer speaks volumes back with the project team   Wait  it gets worse  By not having a direct contact with your customers  the pendulum starts to swing toward inside out thinking  That your project team s groupthink starts to take over and you get on a path toward endlessly evolving the product you currently have   Survey response shows that if we build these 10 features  we ll appease some portion of our installed base  Guess what  you now have an option heavy  difficulty to use  hard to explain end result on your hand   Get out and meet the customer  don t rely on tools and technologies to do your investigative work for you  Purposely block time in your calendar for these activities  make it the same time each week so your team gets in a cadence on when you ll be out of the office   Next problem  I have a product management past as both a hiring manager and an individual contributor  It is incredibly simple to hire  or even help interview others for your extended team  those employees who offer to keep your world at the status quo  These are people who can fit it with the team today  who will adopt to your processes  and listen and obey the will of the team  However  this couldn t be more self destructive   If you don t hire  or help others hire  the best person for the job   and I mean  smarter than you  better than you  someone who will challenge your thinking  maybe even take your job someday  then you are doing your team and company a major disservice  The rising tide aphorism couldn t be truer  You want to surround yourself and your team with the very best personnel  They elevate your game  invoke necessary change  and even challenge the status quo  The quality of what you deliver to customers rises and everyone benefits from the energy these amazing employees will bring to the team   Lastly  one of the most commons mistakes I see in product management is that we don t spend enough time developing out the business need case for what we want people to build solutions for  I ve witnessed on too many occasions that a product manager will agree to build a feature which  sounded like a good idea   Why wouldn t the customer want that  It makes sense to all of us  we can build it in no time at all   It is really easy to go right into  Execution Mode    where everyone gets excited and starts building right away  You can quickly show your executive sponsor how nimble your team is and that you can be more responsive than any of the other teams in your division  But then somewhere in all of this excitement  someone decides to ask the question   What is the business rationale for doing this   Oops  I didn t hear that  Competitive threat  Sales enabler  New business in country X  Now everyone have stop what they re doing  take a step back  look at the Product Manager and ask the  Why  question   If and when this happens  you just lost some portion of trust with your team  which will now take twice as long to get back  Oops is right  I cannot emphasise enough how important it is to fully understand your market  the business opportunities and gaps you re trying to address  among other aspects of the space you are building products in  Every feature you want your team to develop needs to be tied back to the needs of the business and its customers   It will be critically important to have this information as you have your dialog with all members of the business  Always take a step back when the next  great big idea  comes around  Ask the right questions on behalf of the business  nobody else will but you and only you will be able to champion its value with the other parts of the organization  Support  Marketing  Sales  and C Staff    What are some innovative trends that you recognize in today s product management   Our company recently adopted techniques from the LUMA institute in both our User Experience and Product Management functions here at Autodesk  The subject matter isn t new per se  but the techniques to gauge requirements  priorities  and product focus are wonderful  Simply put  LUMA forces everyone in the room to get out of their seats and collaborate on getting to the point of the gap you d like to fill and how best to do it  It s very customer centric and includes well thought out set of procedures for engagement   Like many firms  we test drive new technology all of the time  In the past 12 months  we ve been focusing on tech that lets us better communicate inside our office as well as with our customers   We are avid users of Medium  Slack  and Salesforce Chatter for our team communications  and we use Radian6  Sprinklr  Intercom  and SurveyMonkey for engaging with our customers either 1 1 or 1 many  It s important to understand what channels your particular customers like best for communication  there will always be new technology for surveying and listening to customers to support the product management function  and it s our role to keep up to date on what s new and relevant   Another trend I ll point to is about how teams organize to support a project  Based upon observation  I think this is one of those areas where project teams tend to get comfortable in their current environments and never ask themselves if they are optimized for product delivery based upon a seating chart  Seems simple  right  Should we have doors or cubes  Should we locate in an office we all commute to  or all at home connected with video and audio devices   Based on the product you are about to embark on  one of the topics you should consider is how and where you are going to organize to best complete your teams  project  The product manager should take this on   it s a matter of either having a healthy  excited  executing team or a stale environment where everyone has had the same desk for the past 12 months  with the same view  the same conversations you get my meaning   Follow Eric Stover on Twitter for

1141,training-dataset/product/1164.txt,product,Agile Product Management with SCRUMIn the recent years  the process of agile product management with SCRUM created a great impression on the business world  especially in the field of the IT development  While there are different approaches to agile development  one of the most famous processes in this area is called SCRUM  Because of it  many software developers have begun incorporating this process and also began envisioning the workflow of product creation in a different manner   But  at the same time  its introduction generated a ripple effect that impacted things like product management  product ownership and also the customer relations  All of these have taken a hit from SCRUM because they are mostly still based on the set practices of the previous development models  The same failed to adapt quickly enough to the approaching tidal wave brought on by the appearance of agile product management and this lead to several important managerial aspects   In parallel  there is no denying it that the new approach to development generates great results and that the task of the management structures is to find a way to consolidate their dealings with the SCRUM potential  Through experience  several important ideas have developed which can be the power to change this situation and allow SCRUM and management departments to produce excellent results  Here are the main points of this process of realignment of these crucial aspects of the development field   SCRUM Impacts on Product Management  When it first emerged  the practice of agile development was mostly confined to the departments where the software development actually took place  But then  several years ago  SCRUM began emerging as a new force that encompassed not only the software aspects but also many other departments in a company  This expansion of the same system left product managers unsure how to approach the new working environment  Initially  agile product management with SCRUM included things like peer development  unit based testing  builds on a daily basis and a continuous process of integration   These offered a new breathing space for the software developers  but things like the life cycle of the product  transparency of the organizational process and the expectations of the customers were not imported  But then  when agile development expanded into SCRUM  it became apparent that product managers and product owners needed to be included in the process as a single unit  This created the very upheaval  but also opened space for its resolution   Agile Product Management With SCRUM  Much of the issues revolving around SCRUM best practices that collide with the product management are the result of an unclear understanding of their mutual interactions  SCRUM is based upon the idea of generating results just in time  not simply optimizing them  While the agile process is also interested in building only those things that are needed  SCRUM goes even further and lowers the amount of work to the minimal necessary amount that is then rapidly implemented  sometimes called the  sprint    On the other side of the development chain lies the product owner or product manager who needs to keep on track the backlog of the product  manage priorities based upon stakeholders and their feedback or on customer expectations and do similar processes  Many of these processes were already a part of any product management department s regular duties and jobs  but now  when the idea of product management with SCRUM bursted on the scene  the key element was and still is the right timing   SCRUM as Short and Fast Approach  Teams that work on the SCRUM principle operate in an effective manner  where iterations are short and continuous  The same is true for their products  where it is believed that the shortest and most regular software releases keep on track its quality  This is why at the beginning of every sprint the objectives are reviewed  user feedback is examined and the effects of the sprint that took place before this one are taken into considerations   Here is where product management often fails in the process of becoming a part of the agile management using SCRUM  Instead of leaving the engineers to go at it alone  the representatives of the management department need to be present in the sprint cycles  even if they include the longer  two week period   There is no doubt that many managers feel a lack of time and energy for them to be included in the SCRUM process  but without them on board  the short and fast approach will ultimately fail the company in some phase  simply because the best practices are worthless is the project hits a wall between the sprint cycles  The same notion is completely true for product owners  even if they are not the part of the direct product management department of a company   While they might know very little about the actual software development process  they need to know the timelines  fallback plans  and many other ideas that will most definitely be utilized by the development teams they are facilitating   SCRUM and Management Collaborations  SCRUM is not only a small structural change in the software development  Instead  it demands thorough organizational change that will allow product management with SCRUM to redefine the possibilities of a company  This means making changes in the way how printers are set and how the product itself is released  This way  any change or unforeseen circumstance can become a valuable asset and not a catastrophic problem  The merge of the management with the SCRUM process manes more transparency and a simpler task of identifying weaknesses and structural problems  At the same time  the company s development teams are better tuned to the needs of the management  while the management can help the development process if this is required   Conclusion  No one can guarantee that SCRUM will lead to improvements in every business organization and in every circumstance  But  it is also important to realize that having SCRUM and not implementing it to its fullest extent is a lot bigger problem than not to have it at all  Because of this  software development teams and product management have to work together with the same process to give it a chance to really become a huge ally for any company   This demands work and tough changes from all parties involved  but the potential outcomes it worth everything that is invested in it  even if this demands moths of reorganization and deep structural changes  But  once the agile product management with SCRUM is fully integrated and accepted by all departments in a company  it can really present itself as one of the truly essential advances in the field of IT management of the recent decades,"[1141 1329 192 1372 1366 201 469 140 1287 138 121]"
1149,training-dataset/product/424.txt,product,Becoming a Platform Product Manager53 Flares 53 Flares    I m a product manager for a content management system that runs some of the most visited websites in the world  Our team reports to the CTO  and we sit within the engineering arm of the organization  Prior to this I d had a year s product experience at a customer facing SaaS company and naively I believed I could copy paste this experience  I was wrong  At its heart a CMS is a platform  not a product  I quickly found that I needed to become a platform product manager   There are many differences between product management in a consumer facing world and a platform world  This article describes my experience of how stakeholder and user needs for a platform product   as distinct from user needs for a solutions product   influence the platform product manager s ability to create value  and hopefully provides some guidance to anyone interested in how you should alter your thinking when you switch product types   Platform vs Product  What s the difference between a platform and a product   Here are some answers    A product is something you sell  A platform is common infrastructure that you build products on     Platforms are structures that allow multiple products to be built within the same technical framework    Platforms exist to make it easier to solve a problem that s common to multiple businesses or products    Our content management system is a platform that is used by web sites to build their content  It s a set of reusable components  a common infrastructure  and a group of APIs that feed the front end output for multiple web sites  which are also separate business units  We build tools that editors use to publish content to the site  but these are only one piece of the CMS puzzle  The editor output is  in essence  one piece of the many APIs that produce the revenue generating product website   Users and Stakeholders   Solutions vs Platform Product  At my former role managing a revenue facing product  the product created value for multiple customer personas  and the product manager supported stakeholders throughout the company including sales  marketing  and customer service  Although there were plenty of stakeholder management challenges  we did not have to consider how to support the infrastructure of separate business units   For a CMS product underlying multiple websites  which are also their own business units   there are multiple users and stakeholder constituencies whose needs need to be taken into account   Developers who build products based off our core platform Editors who use the CMS product to build content for the end users  but have unique content strategies based on the end users reading their content End users who eventually consume the web content who have unique reasons for consuming a site s content PMs and PMMs who manage customer facing products driven by the CMS  Each of these constituencies have both overlapping and divergent needs  To build a roadmap for a platform product  the CMS product manager needs to support the use cases that are common among the groups  while also supporting the key ways in which they are different   Building Roadmaps   Solutions vs Platform Product  At my customer facing role  I built my roadmap by talking with customers and partners  and vetted business ideas through experimentation  Each experiment and product tweak was a lever to pull towards the goal of increasing revenue   I quickly learned that this product management style would not work in a platform world  Constant iteration and tweaking of the product is not only extremely difficult to do  but can also endanger the quality of the product  After spending time with users  I realized that this quick hit iterative approach completely misses the point of what the users are looking for   In a CMS platform environment   The business demands that the platform be a solid foundation upon which to run their products  Developers need maintainable solutions that don t require endless hours of QA for each upgrade  Editors need to maintain a solid and up to date conversation with users  which requires stable yet innovative technology  End users want web pages that perform well  Platform products need to provide a reliable and extensible experience   Reliable and extensible platform products   how do you get there   Quality Assurance  One of the best ways to provide reliable platform product is to maintain rock solid QA   In a platform world  bugs in code aren t irritants that can be easily fixed by a quick push to production  but problems that break the fundamental systems upon which your users  products are built  More so than in a solutions product environment  bugs erode user confidence in the product   Platform product managers must find creative ways to lead QA to best regression test product to suss out bugs  Because others products are built from your product  platform products are  in the words of Marty Cagan   a critical dependency for all of your customers products you support  and there is no room for error    Long term Thinking  The day to day experience of being a platform product manager can feel like walking a marathon  Unlike in a solutions product role in which products are iterated on and shipped constantly  platform products require longer release cycles  which means careful management of user expectations and timelines   That said  there is a flipside to that idea  Platforms also need to be extensible so that businesses can rely on the products for the foreseeable future  Therefore  platform PMs need to be creative experts in their domain   able to think critically about their users  needs while thinking creatively with their team about how to build a platform that allows for future growth and revenue opportunities   Continual Reassessment of Priorities  Product managers often reassess priorities  making sure they are aligned with what will provide the most value  Platform product managers have so many constituencies that   in my experience   a reassessment of priorities needs to happen much more often than in a solutions based product world   For long term planning purposes  platform PMs must remain in continual communication with each of the constituencies they support  This requires meetings  of course  but also multiple little conversations on Slack  email  within ticket comments  in the hallway  wherever  Platform PMs must remain open to continually running through detail after detail with their constituency  so that they support them in their day to day use of the product  and understand their long term needs   Conclusion  As Brian De Haaff  co founder of product roadmap software company Aha   says   Working with several software products and services built upon a common platform is no easy feat   It s hard to focus on the less glamorous product management work of quality assurance and release management  maintaining steady effort and focus for the long term  That said  product management for a platform is just as challenging and interesting as product management for a revenue generating solution  Whether the product directly affects revenue or provides a platform and tools that allow users  businesses and products to thrive  it is great fun to build a product that allows its users to shine,"[1149 433 1116 984 605 381 192 121 24 692 356]"
1168,training-dataset/product/852.txt,product,Freelance Consulting and Product Management50 Flares 50 Flares    When should a start up hire its first product manager  What responsibilities should this role include  These are common discussions  with many views  and no right answers   it depends on the founding team  current funding situation  industry focus  and product offering  But it s likely there will always be a fair bit of product management work at any start up  and some of it will exceed what the current team is capable of doing  Therein lies the opportunity for a product management consultant   Consulting on a part time and freelance basis may be a viable option for you  depending on where you are in your career  It can be a good way to join a growing start up before they are ready to make a full time product hire   So how do you serve as a product management consultant  how do you decide if such a move is right for you  and how do you frame the services you can offer   What Does the Opportunity Look Like   Even if you re only thinking about it as a temporary move  it s important to think about the goals you may have as a consultant   Consulting on a limited basis gives you much more visibility into a firm than any amount of interviewing   Alternatively you might be interested in becoming a product manager for the first time  and picking up a project or two will aid in that transition  especially if you have a more flexible primary job   freelance product designer  for example   You may be an experienced product manager looking to move into a different industry or start a new company  and consulting is a good way to earn supplemental income during this time   In other cases  there may be an opportunity to build a permanent  independent business based on product management consulting  though this may not be clear at the outset   Thinking about the goal of consulting will help you identify projects that fit  if you re looking to find a new full time role  a 30 hour per week opportunity with a promising firm could be a very good move   Skills Beyond Product Management  Being a product management consultant is similar to other types of consulting  the seller doer model is common  Skills beyond product management are important  and include   sales and business development to find opportunities  negotiation to align on project scope and cost  marketing acumen to promote the nascent consulting business   These additional skills may be good professional development opportunities for product managers  Using your network of former colleagues  partners  and other contacts will jump start these efforts  help to build skills  and make it easier to identify prospective consulting projects   Of these non product management skills  negotiation of scope and price may be the least familiar to you  One solution for this is to find mentors who have provided consulting in the past to provide guidance  In general  investing time in scoping pays dividends  it is better to avoid taking on a hard to complete project before you ve invested time drafting a proposal  schedule  budget and perhaps even starting to do some of the work  The more conversations that take place with prospective clients  the easier it will be to scope these projects   How to Decide if you Should do it   There are a few tactical considerations before you jump in   Is there enough work  Is there demand for what you are supplying  A good rule of thumb is that only 30 50 per cent of the work that is discussed will happen  This percentage may get closer to 50 per cent once some projects have been started  but you should make sure you have a surplus of project work before you start consulting   Are your earnings assumptions based on a realistic cost for your services  It may be hard to price your services  especially for the first few projects  Building some flexibility into what you can charge will be important  In the early days  it may be better to discount your rate to get work in rather than skip what would otherwise be a good project   Are you comfortable with the lifestyle  To be a consultant is to be  untethered   work relationships are not as consistent  The independence can be exhilarating or it can be scary  And the work is less consistent   some months may be very busy  while others may be quiet  These are important considerations if you look to consulting as a longer term move  Other considerations can be industry specific  For example  in my industry   building and energy management   many innovative firms are small and lack a dedicated product management team  But given the fragmentation and rapid technology shifts in this industry  there is a need for product management  It was hard to quantify  but I saw that firms would consider outsourcing some product management tasks  I assumed this meant that at least a handful of opportunities would turn into actual consulting projects   What Services Should a Consultant Offer   Typical product management consulting opportunities fit into one of three buckets   1  Smaller companies that have a roadmap and a strategic direction  but do not have any staff to work on the rest of a product management role  competitive analysis  market sizing  research on potential new  long term opportunities  and messaging positioning  In this case  a consultant could take on one or a few of those tasks and report back to full time staff  This work can be outsourced more easily than management of the roadmap because it doesn t require an ongoing cadence and a strong  direct relationship with developers  Some firms may appreciate an outside view on what is happening in the market  This is especially true when the consultant has a strong background in the industry and brings significant past experience   2  A second option is to work with a firm that is trying to incubate a business but is not ready to make full time hires  This type of consulting engagement will probably last at least a few months and requires a wider set of tasks  the consultant acts as a temporary product manager  conducting market research and competitive analysis work  but also translating this into actual requirements and a proposed roadmap  The business that hires a consultant to incubate a new unit will probably look for someone with strong product management background and subject matter expertise  If the firm decides to invest in the business after the consulting engagement  it may want the consultant to become one of the first hires   3  The third option for a product management consultant is to focus on projects that can be more easily conducted by an independent party  like user feedback testing and interviews  where industry knowledge is helpful but not required  An independent contractor can find it easier to interview current company clients and gather information on what they like about its products and what needs to be improved  When I was a full time employee  I once worked with a consultant who conducted detailed interviews with a handful of our customers   the feedback was provided anonymously by users  The conclusions were extremely valuable  and a permanent employee would have been unable to collect such compelling feedback  as most clients would have been hesitant to open up   When proposing and scoping potential consulting opportunities  it can be helpful to frame them within one of the options above  This framework can be useful to coach and guide a prospective client towards a project scope and help to bound the discussion and move it from discussing problems to identifying a desired solution  How you position your consulting services is an important consideration   Rich Mironov wrote a very good post on this topic   Product management consulting can be a good way to fill in time between job opportunities  develop new skills  or generate some income while working on a new business  It s becoming increasingly common and may provide professional development benefits  open the door to new full time opportunities  or become a long term entrepreneurial venture,"[1168 605 1092 1131 1099

1340,training-dataset/product/423.txt,product,3 Types of Product Managers  Builders  Tuners  InnovatorsAs the product management role has become far more popular here in Silicon Valley and at technology firms in general  we ve started to see specialization in the role begin to emerge  While these specific product roles rarely have differentiated titles or formal separate requirements  savvy hiring managers are certainly looking for product managers with specific skill sets and passion areas depending on the specific product stage and challenges they are solving for I ve had the opportunity to serve in many distinct product roles as well as lead hiring for such roles as well  So I wanted to share my view of 3 high level product management roles that exist in the field  which I affectionately callThe builders are what most folks would classify as theproduct manager  As product managers are often seen as defining thefor their product  they are responsible for driving the roadmap for an existing product to build ever more useful  usable  and delightful experiences to serve the needs of their target users  Their super powers include truly understanding a target user segment  including their pain points  their proclivities  and what appeals to them  They know how to listen to users for insights on the problems they are solving for and not just taking user feature suggestions at face value  They know how to take the deluge of incoming feature requests  ruthlessly prioritize them  and come up with a coherent roadmap that optimizes for solving the right problems at the right time for their users  They get into the weeds of the entire user experience and are constantly polishing  refining  and reinventing where appropriate  They never feel like their product is done and see how the sky is the limit in terms of how they can expand the scope of their product offering to solve ever more pressing problems for their users They thoughtfully consider the right trade off in every sprint between scope  quality  and time  Yet they are constantly refining the machinery of their internal process to improve overall velocity and create more carrying capacity for future sprints The product managers that love being builders love solving real problems for users  delighting users with the experiences they are creating  and just love bringing products to life A product manager working on the next version of Microsoft Office  LinkedIn Profile  or Google s Android operating system are all great examples of the builders that dominate the product management field The most common example of tuners are the growth hackers that have risen in popularity throughout consumer internet firms  Yet I prefer tuners because it embodies much more than just classic growth hackers  Tuners are folks with a unwavering focus on a specific north star metric that are empowered to do everything in their power to move that metric up and to the right  This normally takes the form of acquisition metrics  say signups   engagement metrics  say retained users   or monetization metrics  say paid subscriber growth  These folks are analytical ninjas  They know everything there is to know about executing A B tests and spend as much time improving the velocity of their testing  improving their testing infrastructure  or improving their analysis capabilities as they do running tests in the first place  They are incredible at idea generation of potential tests and then getting as many of those tests in the pipeline as quickly as possible  They develop strong internal intuition on what hypotheses are likely to work vs not based on the hundreds of tests they have already run in an effort to further prioritize their endless list of potential ideas They seek great ideas and best practices from everywhere but know that nois ever better than simply running a test on your own specific product and users to see if the generalized rule applies to your own audience Tuners relish in moving the needle  They eagerly anticipate getting back the results of a test and seeing if their hypothesis panned out  They love seeing the impact they have on the company s success in a very direct and significant way The classic example of folks that are tuners are Uber s growth team  LinkedIn s paid subscriptions optimization team  Facebook s news feed optimization team  and Google s search relevance team The innovators are the product managers tasked with the incredibly challenging job of finding product market fit for a brand new product  They are truth seekers that take a hypothesis driven approach to validate and iterate on practically every dimension of their product strategy  whether it s target customer  problem their solving  value proposition  product differentiation  go to market  monetization  or more  They are constantly putting ever higher fidelity MVPs in front of potential users and leveraging a variety of customer validation techniques to quickly assess what s resonating with who and why  both from a qualitative research perspective as well as eventually leveraging customer metrics from early product betas Innovators are constantly prioritizing their team efforts based on assessing the riskiest aspects of their product strategy  designing the right approach to validate it  and iterating until they come up with the right answer  At the same time  they are always carefully assessing whether it makes sense to continue to iterate on a dimension or whether it s time to pivot their approach to try something completely different  They leverage a strong combination of product intuition  personal conviction  and customer validation to constantly steer the product team in what ends up hopefully being the right direction  They also accept failure as a very real possibility  since innovation is never straight forward nor easy Innovators absolutely love being on the bleeding edge of bringing new solutions to market that the world has never seen before  They love going from 0 to 1  from whiteboard to launched product offering  and not waiting to see what the future holds  but instead inventing it themselves The classic examples of folks that are innovators are Amazon s initial AWS team  Apple s initial iWatch team  the founding stage of Airbnb  Dropbox  and so many other successful and unsuccessful startups All of these types of product managers exist at established technology firms  while at smaller startups the type of product managers they have often depends on the stage their product is in it s own lifecycle  It also turns out that every product manager in fact does activities embodied in all three roles  but with differing levels of focus  I encourage product managers early on in their career to seek out experiences in all three of these roles in order to gain valuable experiences to round out your product experience but also to learn more about yourself on where your passion and skill lie  There s nothing better or worse about each of these roles  it s simply a matter of aligning your passion and skill with your ideal role One word of caution on taking on the role of an innovator  I encourage folks to first have experience at least as a builder before attempting to take this on  There are unique challenges to being successful as an innovator that become far more difficult to master when you are also simply mastering core builder competencies  making it far less likely for you to be successful in doing so  It s also better to have established success as a builder when building out your personal product management reputation than a string of likely failures that are common as an innovator I hope this provides you a view into some of the specific product manager roles that have evolved as specialization has started to take place in the product management field,"[1340 302 381 1092 24 356 1116 692 340 1131 605]"

Harvard Business School  She has worked for companies like Microsoft and Kickstarter  and is currently the VP of Product at Lola  They connect travelers to travel agents for hotels  restaurants  and any other travelling needs  In her ProductTank NYC presentation  she explains the importance of learning and becoming a better product manager   How Do You Know if You re a Good Product Manager   There is a generic checklist of skills needed for being a good product manager  including things like writing your own code  coming up with A B or A A tests  or doing multi armed bandit tests  However  there will always be new things to learn  No matter how many things you check off of the list  someone will always be able to find something you haven t learned yet  so Ellen argues that you shouldn t focus on your checklist   How Do You Get Better   In fact  Ellen doesn t even think you should focus on how to get better  There will always be things that you don t know  and it will always be beneficial to learn those new things  but it s much more important to establish what you already know and create your knowledge baseline   Set Your Baseline  Product managers tend to sit somewhere between technology  design  and business  in terms of their skill sets  While most people assume that all product managers sit right in the middle of those three areas  knowing a little bit about each  that is not the case  Where a product manager s skill set lies depends largely on their educational and or professional background   If they come from an engineering background  their skills and knowledge will most likely lean towards technology  They tend to be very good at product development  coding  and A B testing  If someone starts out as a designer  they will be more skilled in design and they will most likely be better with user interviews  scenarios  and sketches  Likewise  a product manager with a marketing or business strategy background will be better at the business side  having skills like account management  funnel analysis  and marketing   Finally  some product managers don t come from any of these backgrounds  There tends to be three distinct areas of expertise in product management right now  but many people are entering the field from new areas  which only enriches the discipline more   How Others Perceive You  While it is extremely important to know where your expertise lies  it is also important to know how your team members perceive you  Ellen explains that since she went to school for engineering  most people assumed she was a great engineer and therefore was most skilled in the technology area  However  she identifies much more as a designer  She is better at  and enjoys  sitting down with users and getting their feedback about their personal experience with the product  and solving issues they experience   Soft Skills  A fourth set of skills that Ellen explains as being important for product managers to have are less technical and more social  They are keeping the team motivated  communicating with the team about plans both in person and in writing  and being liked by both the team and management  Granted  you don t always have to be popular  but it is important to know when you do   How Do You Decide What s Next   When figuring out where to go next  you first need to examine where you are currently struggling  There are three main areas that most product managers tend to struggle  and they are the same areas that product managers tend to be skilled at  They are technology  design  and business  If you are experiencing difficulties with shipping your product  you most likely have an issue in technology  If you have an issue with user acquisition or retention  your problem most likely lies in design  If you re having trouble with your company relationship  your issue is most likely in business  If you re having trouble with your team or product  your problem could lie in a combination of all three areas   What Will Your Company Need Next   If you aren t experiencing issues in any of these areas  you should be focusing on where you can improve  This is when you need to start asking questions like what skill sets could you add to your team  what major products do you have upcoming  what stage is your company at  and has your team been at that stage before  It can also be possible that you re working at a larger company and not having a direct impact on the day to day business  That is when you can focus more on your own personal skills   Play to Your Strengths  The first option you have in this scenario is to build up what you are already good at  Think about the things that everyone always asks you for help with  If you re already good at those things  and everyone already trusts you with them  it will be much easier to improve on them  You can also think about what you would genuinely enjoy learning about  If you have an interest or passion in something  you will not only have a better time learning about it  but you will be better at implementing it too   Even Out Your Weaknesses  On the flipside  there are the things you avoid doing  hope other people don t ask you to do  or ask coworkers to do for you  Unfortunately  there is no great way to overcome these things  You just need to take them one step at a time  Eventually  though  you will get more confident in them  and won t avoid them as much  You may even turn a weakness into a strength   How Do You Learn It   Ellen suggests that there are many ways to build up strengths and even out weaknesses  You need to know what works best for you  You can get formal education like colleges courses  you can get a new job  or new project at your current job  and learn by experience  you can pay a teacher or coach to teach you  you can take online classes  or you can do your own independent research   Five Questions to Ask Yourself  In order to figure out what medium to use in your education  Ellen gives five questions to ask yourself   First  how do you prefer to learn  or what works best for you  If you know that you prefer college classes over independent research  you will have more success in college  Is the knowledge you re seeking tactical or strategic  Tactical means you re learning something to meet a specific goal  whereas strategic means you re learning to better prepare you for the future  Is this knowledge adjacent to what you re already skilled at  This relates back to playing to your strengths  versus evening out your weaknesses  How much do you need this knowledge to succeed  Are you learning this new skill to avoid being fired  or simply to enhance your skill set  Finally  do you need credibility in this skill  Some companies require the piece of paper proving your competencies  while others do not   How You Learn is a Continuum  Ultimately  everyone learns differently  and every situation is different  What you prefer to do  what is successful for you  and what is available to you  can all be different  That is why how you learn falls on a spectrum  ranging from school to self directed  Everyone falls on the spectrum  and you can move along the spectrum at any time  Understanding where you fall on the spectrum will immensely help you as a product manager and will help you improve  Ellen emphasizes that you shouldn t be worrying about whether or not you re a good product manager  You should be worrying about how to become a better one,"[1345 1113 793 423 1131 605 24 356 990 381 984]"

1365,training-dataset/product/915.txt,product,You Are Not the CEO of Anything1 1K Flares 1 1K Flares    When Ben Horowitz wrote his groundbreaking memo good product manager  bad product manager nearly 20 years ago he described a product manager as the CEO of the product  While this has gotten a lot of people excited about the job I couldn t disagree more   unless you re the founder and the product manager at the same time  you are not the CEO of anything   While you could argue that a product manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of a product in much the same way the CEO is ultimately responsible for the success of the business  even that similarity is a stretch  A product manager ultimately has a CEO behind them somewhere  and can always pass the buck  Now most product managers don t pass the buck  and this ownership of the problem and willingness to make the hard decisions is where a product manager gets closest to being a CEO but there is a massive difference between having someone behind you or really having the final say   Where the two roles differ completely is in authority  Product managers simply don t have any direct authority over most of the things needed to make their products successful   from user and data research through design and development to marketing  sales  and support  Even today s most senior product leaders only have hiring and firing control over their direct reports   other product managers  Does that sound like any CEO you know   A CEO  on the other hand  stands truly alone  with ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of not just the company but every product in it  The CEO also controls all the resources of the company   with hiring and firing prerogatives across the company and final say on the budget  Does that sound like any product manager you know   Not just Semantics  This may seem like mere semantics but the distinction is important  Too many product managers I meet buy into this trope of CEO of the product and believe their role is to act like an authoritarian CEO  often with disastrous results  These product managers tend to believe they have all the answers  that they produce the best solutions and designs  and that their teams should just do what they re told  They re mini CEOs after all   Lead  don t Command  Truly successful product leaders instead embrace their lack of authority and lead their teams and the wider company through communication  vision  and influence  They focus on collaborating across the company  bringing together the best people to move the product forward  and setting those teams free to execute on their product vision   In Daniel Pink s book To Sell is Human  he refers to this skill as the ability to  move  people from one mindset to another  Successful product managers and leaders spend a significant portion of their time engaged in these  moving  activities  bringing everyone together around a shared understanding of the customer problem so that everyone can be involved in helping solve it to further the business goals   Product management is a team sport after all  and the best teams don t have bosses   they have coaches who ensure all the skills and experiences needed are present on the team  that everyone is in the right place  knows where the goal is  and then gets out of the way and lets the team do what they do best in order to reach that goal   As Ken Norton  Product Partner at GV  says in my upcoming book Product Leadership  How Top Product Managers Launch Great Products and Build Successful Teams   When you re a product manager  you re generally not the boss  You need to gain authority through your actions and your leadership skills  not your role    Most of the product leaders we interviewed for the book echoed sentiments like this   A lot of people say the product manager is like the CEO or the captain of the ship  I don t really think of it that way because when you describe things like that it makes it seem as though you re making all the decisions  or you re driving how everything works together  and you re not   adds Mina Radhakrishnan  the first Head of Product at Uber   You are not the CEO  You are not the CEO of your product  you are not Steve Jobs  you are not a lone genius designing a product from your ivory tower  Never forget that as a product leader you are only as good as your team  and setting them up for success and giving them the space and air cover to do their best is ultimately how you and your product will be successful   Now just because you can pass the buck to someone higher up the chain of command doesn t mean you should  You should live and die by your product s success and failure anyway  because giving it your all is important whether you re the CEO or not   But one day    I think actually product leaders  not surprisingly  are often seen as great potential candidates for the CEO or COO when they get further on in their career  I think that s because at an executive level  all the product management attributes are really relevant because you re focused on the money  you re focused on the users  you re focused on the data  and you re focused on the future  says Tanya Cordrey  Non Executive Director   Digital Adviser at the  Schibsted Media Group   So while you may not be the CEO of anything right now  the funny thing is Product Leaders make for great CEOs and maybe some CEOs could do with acting more like Product Leaders  All those skills of leading without authority  moving mindsets  and setting your team up for success are what define great CEOs too  so if you want that title  keep working on those skills and who knows where you might end up   Enjoy what you ve read  Good  because there s an entire book full of this stuff   I ve been working with two masters of product Richard Banfield and Nate Walkingshaw on writing a book that all product professionals can benefit from  Partly out of curiosity and on the back of our own experience  we ve interviewed almost one hundred product leaders  Their insights and experiences will open up the conversation and take the lid off the mystery of great product leadership   The Product Leadership book is being published by O Reilly and will be out on shelves in May 2017 but you can pre order the book on Amazon today   You can follow us at  rmbanfield   bfgmartin  and

1372,training-dataset/product/895.txt,product,not Just Maintaining188 Flares 188 Flares    Or Three Ways Product Owners can Stay on top of Scrum  2016 was a big year for the Justinmind product development team  We shipped a new feature every month or so  tackled bug fixes and upgraded the usability of our software  an interactive prototyping tool   With hindsight it was exciting  but such intense activity presents challenges for a product owner  backlogs can get baggy and prioritization between user stories can become complex  Failure to get on top of a growing backlog can result in creeping product instabilities  I thought it was time to start managing Justinmind s product backlog more effectively   The Challenges of Backlog Grooming  In theory the product backlog sprint relationship is simple  you prioritize user stories in the Product backlog and  when a new sprint rolls around  pull the top priorities into the sprint and let the team get to work   In practice though  there are complicating factors  In smaller teams it s difficult to do everything you would like or need to do in a two week sprint   and it s impossible to go into a detailed cost benefit analysis of every task  every fortnight  Most saliently  it can sometimes feel like the Scrum methodology creates imbalanced sprint workflows  prioritizing major product changes against small tweaks becomes impossible with everything piled together in the backlog  With no separation between categories of user story  there s a risk that Product Owners can start to avoid heavy new feature stories and just focus on the low hanging bug fixes  or vice versa   At Justinmind we felt like we were comparing apples with oranges and ending up with problems  so we explored ways to improve our backlog management  Mini backlogs  More Organization  As product owner  I came up with a system for managing backlog activities that was agile enough to work for a small product team  but also rigorous and objective enough to ship large scale features regularly  My system revolves around categorizing user stories into related groups using color coded JIRA filters  which allows user stories to be filtered by priority within their category   Say I want to manage UX Improvements stories in the backlog  I click the blue tab at the top of main backlog and all other stories are filtered out  Now it s easier to prioritize these stories because like is compared with like  I can manage this mini backlog by putting priority features at the top  before moving on to the next mini backlog and doing the same   Within each filtered section  we use a scoring system to determine task difficulty  Like any scoring system  it has to be fast to implement  no one wants to spend more time scoring stories that working on them  and transparent to product stakeholders  Scrum poker works for us  the team estimates each task in the backlog according to a points system   1 for easy up to 16 for epics   using personalized Scrum cards  a relaxed yet focused approach that encourages honest discussion and more efficient story estimation   When the time comes to build a sprint  I go into each mini backlog and harvest the top two or three user stories  adding them to the sprint  Justinmind s sprints usually contain stories that add up to 35 points  based on past experience and team size  this is a realistic sprint workload for us  Bigger teams or teams with different capabilities will have different points capacity   Split Backlogs  Split Roadmaps  Justinmind s product team is pretty small  so the mini backlog system described above works nicely for us right now  However  in a bigger scrum team with more user stories  the mini backlog system can be extended into splitting your product backlog in two  On one side would be ongoing tasks  including bugs and improvements to features  on the other side anything new  such as features  The big new features and product lines should be prioritized in detail using a scoring system  whereas as the ongoing tasks  which are likely to be repetitive and familiar in scope  can be dealt with more loosely and analyzed less meticulously  This frees up product owners to focus on large new tasks while still pro actively managing stories   For some agile teams  splitting user stories into two separate roadmaps might mean dividing out the product owner s responsibilities between two new roles  say product backlog manager and product owner  as Andrew Petro argues  While this isn t mandatory  it is another solution for when the product backlog starts to sprawl   Velocity Tracking  Another option for product backlog management is to track a team s velocity  or how much work gets done in a sprint  Once the product owner has tracked velocity over a few sprints and collected some averages  this data can be used to forecast how many stories and of what type can be added to future sprints   Calculating velocity is simple  In a two week sprint  the product team delivers stories with a combined value of 35  making that sprint s velocity 35  The next sprint they deliver stories with a value of 20  The average velocity is  therefore  27 5  Anything your team counts in story points  including bugs and tweaks  can impact velocity estimation  incomplete stories don t count towards velocity  sorry   For our team  we tracked our velocity to be about 35 user story points a month  Every time I build a sprint  I add stories that have been evaluated in scrum poker by the scrum team  and try not to exceed 35 points  I keep an eye on the velocity average once in a while  to make sure we re working as we should be   Such long term velocity tracking allows product managers to estimate how long they ll take to work through their current backlog  and justify this estimation empirically to teams and stakeholders   The great part about velocity tracking is  the more you do it the better you get  The greater your data on team capacity and performance  the more accurate your backlog management will be   Pro active Backlog Management  The Benefits  Mini backlogs help you to stay organized because they allow you to compare like with like when prioritizing tasks  and they help maintain a varied spread of activities in each sprint  Additionally  it s not the end of the world if the scrum team hasn t evaluated the difficulty of each story before the sprint is built  because they re already organized by priority   On a deeper level  we found that breaking the main backlog into sections resulted in a more streamlined sprint workflow and more effective scrum  Most importantly of all  we ended up with a more balanced development roadmap and  ultimately  a better product,"[1372 1141 192 1329 692 1116 1340 138 302 1131
