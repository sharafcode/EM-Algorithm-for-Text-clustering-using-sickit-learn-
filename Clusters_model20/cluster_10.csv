67,training-dataset/product/461.txt,product,Reasons Why Your Software Project Goes Over Time   Over BudgetIf your company is setting out to build software  it s important to keep in mind the potential challenges and pitfalls that await you and your team  Luckily  Keith Shields of Designli has taken the time to outline some of the biggest obstacles that startups face when starting a new software project   Every client has a budget  and most have a time table they d like to stick with for launching their new app or website  The problem  Estimating the exact time and cost associated with a complex software build out is no easy task  Projects can take several weeks all the way to dozens of months   and before the customer knows it  the project can easily be thousands of dollars over budget and months behind   As a client  all hope is not lost   and there are a few things you can do to help eliminate these common issues  Here are some quick hitters on what to look out for   1  Too Many Scope Changes or an Ill Defined Scope  Keeping a project within scope is a collaborative effort by both client and hired development team  Your project should be clearly defined at the start  and  in the honeymoon rush of bringing on new clients  many development firms and freelancers skip this vital step   Your design and development team of choice can help you with this step  but ultimately you need to have a clear idea with written instructions of exactly what it is you re looking to build  This is the  Technical Specifications Document  that becomes what the development team lives  or  more often than not  dies  by   Many developers try to push off the creation of this specifications document since  yes  it can be time consuming and tedious to flesh out  However  this is important for you as a client because it s how you hold your developer accountable for exactly what they have committed to build for you   After this initial scope document is created  if you continuously change the scope during the course of the project  it can mean major design and coding changes  This will then push your deadline back and possibly cause an increase in costs  So  be sure to do this work upfront   2  Working With an Hourly Contract But Your Scope Isn t Well Defined  Hourly projects have their place in the development world  but they leave the project open for cost increases  We mentioned in the previous section that too many scope changes push back the deadline and increase costs  You can avoid scope changes by defining the scope clearly before the project starts   With a flat rate fixed price  the scope should be clearly defined and then costs are nailed down for the duration of the contract  Fixed price contracts are a good way for you to know the cost of a project without having added costs from unexpected hour input   If you do decide to move forward with development in an hourly manner  make sure you define your scope and expectations clearly in the beginning  The worst thing you can possibly do as a client is to engage in hourly work without a clear end goal of what it is you re building and what will constitute the project as being  done   Your development team will be happy to bill you their hourly rate for the rest of time as you deliberate on features and decide what it is you truly want your app or website to do   3  Poorly Communicated Expectations  It s up to the developer to manage your expectations  Not only do you want to know how much a project costs  but you also want to know what to expect for the final deliverable  One of the worst ways for a project to fail is for the deliverable to disappoint the client due to failed expectations being met   The surest way for a custom software project to go over timeframe is for either party to require  or promise  an unrealistic timeframe  No  you won t be able to build a Facebook equivalent in 1 month  If your developer tells you that he ll finish your Pinterest website in 2 weeks  there s clearly something wrong   Ensure your developer s promises are realistic  and that your expectations are clear   4  Working with Teams That Don t Have Experience Related to Your Project  There are several technologies on the market for producing your application  Some technologies are better than others when you need a specific result  Your development team could be experts in certain technology and not the ones you need for your exact project specifications  which means they ll learn it while coding   Project deadlines and costs increase when developers  learn while coding   It s better to find a team that understands your coding requirements to avoid extra costs due to training  If you find a past portfolio item that is similar to your project  you ll be shocked at how much more realistic the promised time frame and price point become   5  Setting Unrealistic Deadlines or Demands  All clients get excited to see their new project in action  but good development takes time  Your project goes through several iterations  testing and approval before the final product is delivered  Be patient  and avoid unreasonable deadlines or demands of your new team   Building your product is a collaborative effort  after all  Communicate with your project manager  lead developer  graphic designer   everyone involved   to ensure that everyone has what they need and that there are no sticking points  The last thing you need is to push out a half baked product to your users  to whom you ve promised the world  that is still full of bugs and glitches  Be willing to go through the process that the development team has laid out and has perfected over time  and focus on business development and pre launch marketing while waiting for your development experts to finish the product build out   What have you done to ensure the success of your project   sticking to both the expected timeframe and budget that you have allocated  Tweet to us  DesignliCo

75,training-dataset/product/89.txt,product,5 signs your product and UX teams are disconnectedI m a little spoiled  As a product manager and startup founder I ve been lucky to work with fantastic UX design professionals to launch several successful products and features   I ve seen first hand how great products come to life when product management and UX work closely together at the early stages of product development   But it doesn t always happen that way   All too often  product and UX are siloed and don t have a shared understanding of the customer or the job to be done  Or product and UX don t collaborate effectively  It s unfortunate  After all  product managers and UX designers share the same goals  right   Although product and UX roles often overlap  the skills required from great product managers and great UX designers are different  The way I think about it is that product managers are focused on market requirements and the success of the product from a business perspective  UX is focused on understanding users  needs and implementing solutions to improve their experience   Where can things go wrong  Here are some symptoms of a disconnected PM UX relationship and a few ideas of what you can do to fix them   1  UX isn t included in customer discovery  To me  the most important part of product management  and the most fun  is customer discovery determining the customer s jobs to be done  the product s value proposition  the minimum viable features  and so on   So why is it then that so many product managers conduct customer discovery and then throw their learnings over the fence to  the designers    Isn t it equally important for UX to understand customers  motivation and pain   At a previous company I helped validate and launch a major new service  We were designing the service from scratch  and I was on point to engage with prospective customers to understand what to build  At the early stages our small team included a UX designer to hear the customer needs  directly from prospects   understand the problems  and learn about the solutions we would potentially displace   Our team began building this customer learning into early wireframes and then prototypes so we could learn iteratively during the validation phase  It also gave us a visual way of engaging with prospects rather than a simple phone interview  This made a big difference   The result was a cohesive team that launched an innovative service with a design that leapfrogged the competition  The customer adoption exceeded our expectations and I chalk that up in large part to the collaboration between product and UX at the earliest stages   2  Roadmap initiatives lack UX consideration  In a recent post on our blog  Michael Peach of Pendo wrote that  onboarding requirements and measurements should be included with every item on the roadmap  the same goes for UX considerations   UX should not be exclusively separate initiatives  but rather baked into every feature on the roadmap  UX is an ongoing part of the process   I talk often about how products are built iteratively  but this doesn t mean that iterative products lack UX consideration  And it certainly doesn t mean that design is something that you  skin  on a feature after it s been released  Great design and usability should be baked into the earliest MVP   An obvious solution is for leadership to provide an appropriate level of UX resources  If only 1 designer is shared among several PMs and dozens of developers  there will be strain on the process   Regardless of resources  it s essential for product to communicate regularly with the UX team as the roadmap is developed and inevitably changes  When product thinks of UX as an important stakeholder  the roadmap is likely to include design as a core part of new initiatives   3  Product and UX aren t working collaboratively  How collaborative is the relationship between your product and UX teams  Teams with a continuous exchange of feedback and regular meetings will build better products   I encourage product teams to involve UX in the early feature discussions  When UX isn t involved in feature discussions  the UX team won t feel as much ownership  Or you run the risk of the UX team not being on the same page   Or even worse  the feature isn t well received and PMs blame the designers  or designers blame PMs    At ProductPlan  our customers use our software to build visual product roadmaps  So it s imperative that our product be beautiful and easy to use  In many ways we consider our app to be presentation software  So for most features we integrate UX into our product discovery process as early as possible   For example  we added a feature to make it easier for our customers to add milestones onto their roadmaps  We involved UX in the early discovery to understand the job that our customers wanted to accomplish  There were many ways the milestone feature could have been implemented and our product team worked iteratively with UX and customers to develop a solution we knew would be great  Today  milestones are one of our most used features in the product   Product managers and UX should be on the same page and share a common mission the company s or product s strategic goals  If your strategic goals aren t communicated  or well defined   there will be conflict between product and UX   When product and UX operate in silos you wind up with products and features that aren t compelling  I like the way that Melissa Perri phrased it   Product Management with no user experience design creates functional products that don t make users excited  User experience design with no product management produces delightful products that don t become businesses    In my experience  the best UX and product relationships are fostered by an entrepreneurial environment where risk is accepted  and a free exchange of ideas is encouraged  Tension is sometimes good  UX should challenge product  and vice versa    4  Product and UX are the same person  In some organizations  product and UX are the same person  This is often the case at early stage companies where dedicated design or UX is a luxury  Look  I ve done my fair share of wireframes and usability tests  but I know that a dedicated UX pro can run circles around me   In the past I ve worked on products and acted as the PM UX combo  Once we had the resources to hire an UX designer  there were inevitably improvements that could be made and an open exchange of ideas was encouraged   If your company or product is further along  your team needs to have dedicated product and UX professionals  Although they may overlap depending on your team s structure and capabilities  here s one way of looking at their different responsibilities   Product   Market requirements  Feature requirements  Roadmap prioritization  Set strategic goals and themes  Roadmap communication and release planning  UX   User and persona research  Wireframes  prototypes  site maps  Interaction design  Usability testing  UI text  There have been a lot of articles written about the ratio of UX to product  or engineering   But more important in my mind is where UX is in the organization  How closely are they tied to product teams  If they are reporting to marketing  or another team disconnected from product management  the collaboration may be strained   5   User delight  stories die in your backlog  Most product managers have experienced this at one point  as you prioritize the backlog  or start to cut stories to make a release on time   there is pressure to de prioritize stories that are  user delight  stories  These might be enhancements or even new features that  when the pressure is on  can take a back seat to bugs and customer requests   UX designers love to add as much polish to a product as they can fit in during a development cycle  While MVPs and getting a feature out the door is important  product managers sometimes de prioritize these user stories that are not considered tangible features   Unfortunately these user delight stories sit in the backlog and never make it into a sprint  After all  how can a PM trade out that  P3 bug  for a slick loading animation your designer has been working on  How does a PM quantify something as amorphous as  user delight  to justify sacrificing some other development initiative   While no one story of this nature makes or breaks the user experience  cumulatively they can add up to result in a product with a mediocre user experience  Savvy users can detect this  leaving them with an impression of a cheap or poor quality product  Users can tell when your product is made with love   After talking with our UX designer at ProductPlan  here are a couple ways you might solve this problem   Give your UX designer a certain number of points each sprint dedicated to user delight  These stories are purely aesthetic in nature and dovetail with more functional user stories  Bake user delight into each story with a checklist that your UX designer signs off on  This can be anything from animations  to button hover states or clever copywriting  This method requires strict discipline on the part of the team  but ensures a gradual improvement of the experience as opposed to cramming in that extra polish towards the end of a release   Anything that adds perceived value to the quality of the product will ultimately pay dividends to your user s experience  And it will simultaneously improve the working relationship between product and UX by demonstrating to your designer that product managers care about design   Through this collaboration when product management and UX work closely together you will build better products  On top of that  a quality product is something a designer can be proud of and this will improve their morale more than anything  Quality products equal happy designers,"[75 341 1388 274 479 1137 145 1083 355 434 1167]"
103,training-dataset/product/146.txt,product,Get better data from user studiesGet better data from user studies  16 interviewing tips  One of my favorite parts of my job is interviewing a huge variety of people about their habits  needs  attitudes  and reactions to designs  I like the challenge of quickly getting strangers to talk freely and frankly about themselves  and to try figuring out new designs and products in front of me  User research shouldn t be like the boring market surveys they read from clipboards in the mall  Great research interviews should be like listening to Terry Gross on Fresh Air   engaging and insightful  That s what I aim for  Here are some tips and techniques that have helped me get the most out of user interviews   1  Get into character  Before I conduct usability studies and research interviews  I take a minute to consciously shift myself into my Researcher Persona  It helps me suspend my usual critical  skeptical  judgemental  know it all attitude  which   for some reason    can interfere with my gathering useful info from participants  It helps me keep my interviews friendly  casual  and conversational   2  Smile  Before I greet a research participant   even for phone interviews   I take a deep breath and smile  I want to appear friendly and welcoming from the start  Smiling makes my voice and my attitude seem friendlier and more positive   Research supports my own experience   And since smiling is contagious  participants usually smile back  improving their attitudes  too   3  Be fascinated  Like a good host  my Researcher Persona also strives to be fascinated by whatever participants have to say  Act  and be   eager and curious to learn as much as you can about their experiences and perspectives  Your body language and expression should reflect that  Face the person  make eye contact  don t cross your arms and legs  look awake  don t furrow your brow or raise your eyebrow s    4  Be neutral and encouraging  Try to remain neutral and encouraging  A simple  mmm hmm  or  uh huh  tells users you re actively listening without a comment or facial expression that leads them or indicates approval or disapproval  Don t get defensive when someone criticizes your product   And they will criticize your product  That s kind of the point    5  Don t judge or dismiss  It s counterproductive to judge users or to dismiss their feedback during a session  Don t think   This user is an idiot  He doesn t know what he s talking about     Your goal is to elicit as much information as possible in the time you have  and to try to understand it all from their perspective  You ll have plenty of time later to reflect on it   6  Build an arc  The quality of the interview and the data you ll collect will suffer unless you put users at ease and earn their trust and confidence  From the moment you greet your interviewee  consciously invest time and energy into building rapport  Start with friendly small talk before transitioning into your interview  Start slow and easy with simple  easy to answer questions before delving deeper into personal experiences or more involved tasks  Then  as you approach the end of a session  make an effort to surface gradually  Like in any conversation  an abrupt ending or dismissal when time s up can seem rude  I often take a minute to summarize a few key points from our conversation before I effusively thank  and pay  participants   7  Ask WWWWWH questions  You re more likely to elicit more information and better stories by asking open ended questions that start with who  what  when  where  why  and how  Lots of yes no questions usually don t spark great conversations  So try to avoid questions like  Would you   Did you   Is it    8  Ask follow up questions  Don t necessarily settle for the first answer you get  A simple well timed follow up question usually prompts a more thorough explanation or valuable examples  Try following up with   Why  When  How   What s an example of that   Silence or a complete the statement question   So when that happened you          Few participants can resist a pregnant pause and a researcher s curious  expectant expression   9  When in doubt  clarify  When you re not quite sure exactly who or what a participant was describing or referring to  ask to be sure and to avoid any misunderstanding    When you said ___  did you mean          After a session  it s too late to go back and figure out what someone was talking about   10  Answer questions with questions  At the beginning of usability sessions  I warn users that I m trying to learn how they would do things  and that I m going to try not to help them or answer their questions unless they get really stuck  Then  when they inevitably ask me questions about the product  I gently  reflect them back by asking questions like   How do you think that would work  What else might you try  How might you get assistance to figure this out    11  Keep it personal and concrete  Help users avoid hypotheticals and generalizations    People think        Everyone wants         I always        Ask for recent  personal examples   12  Watch the time  When you plan your interviews  budget your time to prioritize what you want to cover  Then obey your schedule during your interviews to make sure you cover everything you need to  But  as a good host  don t let your interviewees see you looking at your watch or the clock  Place a clock or your phone somewhere you can glance surreptitiously  I wear my watch on the inside of my wrist so I can easily see it without making the universal  I m bored and checking the time  gesture   13  Don t pitch  The goal of a research study is to observe and listen to users  frank feedback   not to convince them your product is wonderful as is  When I ve encountered product managers who can t keep themselves from trying to sell users on a product  I encourage them to observe remotely   14  Shut up and listen  Check in occasionally to confirm that you re hearing your interviewee   and not yourself   doing most of the talking   15  Watch facial expressions  body language  and tone  yours and theirs   Use your non verbal cues to make interviewees feel comfortable  interesting  helpful  and listened to  Face them  make eye contact  avoid fidgeting and crossing your arms  Focus on the conversation  and don t scribble or type notes during the interview  Watch their body language  too  Look for changes during the session  Do they seem nervous  Tentative  Bored  If so  try restore your rapport and reassure them   This is sooo helpful    and check your own body language again  Don t hesitate to ask what made them roll their eyes  sigh  laugh  frown  smirk  etc   16  Practice   Like any skill  your interviewing will improve with practice  Don t worry about applying all of these techniques immediately  Just pick a few to focus on during your next interview  As those become habits  start incorporating others,"[103 461 1259 1322 188 873 1079 1388 867 1094 231]"
144,training-dataset/product/821.txt,product,Branding a visual asset manager for teamsCrafting a brand is one of the biggest challenges teams face when launching a new product  It involves so much more than just designing a logo you ve got to determine the brand s voice and personality in order to inform your design choices   Even more complicated  What if the new brand is part of an existing brand or company   That s exactly what our team at Noun Project had to work through when we launched Lingo  a visual asset manager for teams  We d like to share the process we used in hopes you can find value in it   Noun Project is a crowdsourced visual dictionary of over 400 000 icons that anyone can download and use  We re driven by our mission of  creating  sharing  and celebrating the world s visual language   But visual language is much broader than just iconography  It consists of colors  patterns  GIFs  photos  and many other types of visual content we interact with on a daily basis   None of this content was on Noun Project  so for us to further pursue our mission we searched for a way to grow beyond the realm of iconography   Our curiosity and explorations lead us to do an internal hackathon based around a simple question  How can we offer new types of visual content outside of iconography to our customers   Hackathons widen your perspective and allow you to find the next big opportunity  The first step of our hackathon was for each team member to interview a cohort of customers  We learned that people loved Noun Project at the beginning of their workflow when they were rapidly prototyping  but when they transitioned into the later stages of their design workflow they started to use their own visual language instead   We also discovered people felt their own assets were cryptically organized on their desktops  hidden deep in folder systems  lost in emails  days away in a Slack channel  or living in a stale style guide   This was an  aha  moment for us we realized it was a chance to help our customers organize their own visual language in a meaningful  effective  and intuitive way   Now that we had a vision and a customer problem to focus on  we started to prototype and work on the new product s brand simultaneously  To avoid any confusion among our current userbase and differentiate its purpose from Noun Project  we decided it was imperative that this new product have an entirely new name and tone   So one of the first things we worked on was figuring out a name for our new product  For our brainstorming session we enlisted the help of the entire team  We gathered in front of a whiteboard and wrote out a few different naming techniques on the wall   Compound  Metaphor  Literal  Service  Abstract  Visual  Feature  These categories jumpstarted a discussion around naming and gave structure to the exercise  We asked that everyone contribute  no matter how silly they felt their ideas were  After all  a funny or random idea can often spark something amazing   Once we filled up the board  we narrowed the ideas down to just 2   Lingo Projects  To keep things transparent and involve the whole team in the decision  we used each name for a week internally  Before long  we realized that everyone hated saying  Projects  and found it to be not only boring  but confusing   So that left us with Lingo  an idea originally presented by our CTO  It was the perfect catchall name that messaged our intentions and hopes for the project  We loved the association  Lingo as  your local dialect   which is essentially what the product is   We had our name  so it was time to start branding  Before doing any sketching  we first had to examine our competitive landscape  This meant looking at the logos  colors  typography usage  and language of other similar products out there  It was important to us that Lingo stood out among our competition   Working on Lingo s visual language entailed creating 3 distinct visual directions to choose from  If you imagine Lingo s concept as a full spectrum  on the far left is a brand most closely related to Noun Project  on the far right is an autonomous brand  and in the middle sits a brand between both worlds   From here we had 3 directions to begin building stories off of  When developing concepts or directions for a brand  3 seems to be the right number as it allows for the  safe  direction  the  middleground  direction  and the  unexpected  direction  Plus  it helps key stakeholders narrow down their favorite route  allowing for a balanced stakeholder designer collaboration   Evolution  the  safe  direction   Digital Craftsman  the  unexpected  direction   Dynamic Convergence  the  middleground  direction   We broke the initial brand presentation into 3 directions  Each had a moodboard to help set the tone for the visual story being told  sketches to showcase the evolution of the symbols per direction  brandmarks  and typography  We decided not to include color in this initial presentation to eliminate any distraction from the symbols   Early on  we felt that Lingo could function as an extension or evolution of Noun Project s marketplace  But as the brand directions and conversations developed  we knew it would be better off as its own entity  This was because Noun Project was a great tool for creation  whereas Lingo was being developed to be a asset management system   These 2 concepts couldn t live together and had to be separated  Lingo was to become an entirely new product and needed to be treated as such  from the product s tone of voice to its UI design  Knowing this helped us narrow down the directions until finally we happily landed on  Digital Craftsman   We loved the metaphor of the craftsman organizing their essential tools on a pegboard above their workbench   We wanted the overall design aesthetic of the chosen direction to feel friendly  inclusive  and sophisticated  Our chosen colors are primaries  the building blocks for all color   Early on  we were inspired by Bauhaus aesthetic for color and some of the decisions around type  We knew we wanted to find a sans serif that was warmer than what Noun Project s font employs  We ended up finding a great sans serif inspired by popular 1920s era fonts  Its rounded edges relayed a friendlier look and feel   The symbol for Lingo was of course inspired by a craftsman s pegboard  Because of this  we made some minor adjustments to the counter spaces and a dot over the  i  to match the circles found in the pegboard motif  The larger dots form an uppercase  L   while the smaller circles balance the symbol while also evoking the pegboard pattern   The branding of Lingo was  and continues to be  an integral part of the product s development and success   We re always fine tuning our brand and shaping the tone of voice with social media  emails  and product screens  When you finish a brand s style guide  you re not actually done you ll always brand and craft your visual and written language   It helped that we brought the entire team into the process we definitely wouldn t have had as successful of a launch without everyone s input  Branding can be approached in so many different ways  whether you re branding internally or with an agency  Hopefully you learned some new a approaches by hearing our perspective and journey   Want to learn more

145,training-dataset/product/993.txt,product,Dealing with UX disagreementsThe big day is here  You ve spent weeks going through the design process  and it s time to get all the stakeholders and executives together for the grand reveal of your product design  Everyone sits down in the conference room  you plug your laptop into the projector  and the screen comes to life   You recap the project goals and audience  then walk everyone through the process you used to create a new solution  After pausing for a moment and taking a deep breath  you click the  Next  button to show your proposed designs  You glance around the room  waiting with anticipation to see their first reaction   Crickets    So  do you think this accomplishes our goals   you ask  with the pit in your stomach growing bigger by the minute    I like it   the marketing director proclaims   It has a dedicated space to show off the latest features and promotions  which will help drive sales    Yes  Positive feedback    I agree   the product owner chimes in   We ve received feedback that users have a hard time finding their account settings  so I think it s great that you moved that section to an intuitive location    Awesome  That s exactly what we were going for    Yeah  I see what you mean   the CEO says   But I was really hoping it would look cooler and more high tech  This seems a little boring to me    Ugh  Disagreement and personal preference   Every UX designer and professional of any kind can relate to this scene  You put in so much effort to develop an amazing solution that you feel super confident about  only to have the wind taken out of your sails by naysayers and differing opinions  We ve all been there   While disagreements can be stressful and frustrating  they don t have to ruin all of your hard work  Here s how to spot the signs that there s a lack of alignment and be the hero who helps your team come together to design a successful product   The  1 cause of differing UX opinions  We see teams struggle with UX design for many reasons  but the top cause by far is that they prioritize business goals over user needs  If your design process is driven by technology and engineering rather than user needs  your product s success will be limited  It may functionally work and be  good enough   but it will never be great because it doesn t address the  user  part of  user experience    Think about 2 of the most famous theme parks of all time  Disneyland and Six Flags  Disneyland had a vision  to create magical experiences for their guests  Every detail from the layout and rides  to the characters  music and more was designed with this vision in mind   Then there s Six Flags  which prioritized profits over the user experience  Their parks were quite popular for a few years  but because they were more worried about the business than their guests  the competitors caught up and drove them to bankruptcy in 2010   Two seemingly similar products with 2 very different outcomes  What s the difference  One focused on the business  while one focused on the user   The external signs of internal friction  Differing UX opinions not only lead to tense emails and awkward conversations within your team  but also create bigger issues that affect the entire company  Can you relate to one of these scenarios   Sales and usage aren t as high as you expected   Years ago  the founder of your company identified a problem they thought tons of other people could relate to  They spent thousands of dollars  maybe even millions  to build a solution and released it to the world with great anticipation    This is our golden ticket   they thought   People are going to love it    But then  nothing   Sales numbers barely hit a fraction of the goal  and usage was low to non existent  What happened  Among other issues  there were probably differing opinions about the product s strategy and direction behind the scenes  which ultimately snowballed and led to disappointing performance   You see people creating  hacks  to use your product   Our team at Drawbackwards was working with a client to redesign the support tool they had originally built to help Customer Service Representatives manage incoming calls  After an initial meeting to discuss the project  we sat with the representatives to learn more about their role  observe how they currently use the tool and identify opportunities for improvement   The first thing we noticed was that many of the reps had Post it notes stuck to their computer screens with instructions on how to complete tasks within the tool  The original designers may have thought the system was intuitive because it met their needs  and they understood it like the back of their hand  But unfortunately  the average user couldn t find the information they needed when they needed it  so they designed their own  hacks  and shortcuts to get the job done   This self design style may allow users to complete their tasks  but its  minor  shortcomings add up to major problems  including lost time  higher costs and unhappy customers   Sprints move slowly   Like its name suggests  a sprint is a short work cycle  usually 1 4 weeks  that helps teams work quickly and effectively  while allowing for adjustments and testing to make progress on a project  However  sprints slow down when there are disagreements about the project s goals or the way they should be achieved  which puts deadlines and budgets at risk   Sometimes  this lack of velocity is a good thing because the project team is taking the time to gather more information and make smart decisions  However  when the project slows down because of rework or team members spinning their wheels  it s a sign that the project and the product as a whole may be in danger   3 ways to use design thinking to overcome disagreements  The first step to overcoming any issue is recognizing the problem  If you can relate to the warning signs above  your team may be suffering from a lack of UX alignment  How can you find a cure  Try these 3 tactics to conquer differing opinions  get everyone on the same page  and lead your team to success   Always put users first  When business goals are prioritized over user needs  your product will only get so far  The irony of product design is that meeting long term business goals is only possible when user needs are put first   The strongest product owners  designers  and business professionals know that  Design Success   User Success   There may be many stakeholders and board members to please  but with this mindset  the end user is the chairman of the board  the one  person  who brings everyone else together and ensures they re all working toward the same goal   Tesla is the perfect example of a company that always puts users first  Owner Elon Musk has a vision for Tesla s user experiences  and he can articulate the exact experience he wants customers to have  When he makes business decisions  he makes them based on what s best for the user  not what s most profitable  easiest  or most cautious   For instance  Tesla s Model S includes Autopilot  a feature that uses sensors  a camera  radar  and digitally controlled brakes to automatically stop the car before crashing  Autopilot was celebrated as a new frontier in safety and convenience until a driver using it died in a fatal crash   Musk could have immediately pulled the feature and gone into damage control mode to save the company s image and avoid potential a drop in sales  That would have been the easiest and most conservative route  Instead  he prioritized his customers and not only decided to keep Autopilot  but also made a bold statement that he still fully believes in its effectiveness and original purpose  to improve safety   The probability of having an accident is 50  lower if you have Autopilot on   he said   Even with our first version  it s almost twice as good as a person    By staying true to his vision and putting users first  Tesla has  and will continue to  design products that change lives and grow their business   The  Design Success   User Success  mindset can t stop at the CEO or executive level  though  This commitment to the user experience needs to permeate throughout the entire organization so every person from product owners to engineers to customer support representatives are all focused on the same thing  the user  Together  they ensure their customers  needs are being met at all times  which results in higher sales  higher satisfaction  and  ultimately  long term success   Conduct usability testing before  during  and after development  When a personal trainer coaches clients through a weight loss  project   they use a scale to objectively track progress and decide how to proceed  Usability testing serves the same role in design projects   As we discussed in our 2 part guide to usability testing  testing is a great way to move past differing opinions because it focuses on data  not personal preference  While many designers test their work after it s completed  testing before  during  and after development leads to the best results   Without testing  everything is a hypothesis that invites subjective opinions about the outcome  Data removes the emotion  ensures the product is on the right track at every milestone  and increases the likelihood of success   Sometimes  even when you have good data from usability testing  team members disagree on what the data means or what to do with it  Ultimately  usability research should serve as a guide  not as a rule  It points you in the right direction 80  of the way  which will help you design a product that s functional  usable  and comfortable  But completing the final 20  and creating a product that s delightful and meaningful requires taking risks or putting your own spin on it  You need a distinct point of view about how the experience should be  which no rulebook can teach   Show  don t tell  Humans learn best by doing  Instead of telling stakeholders and executives the right answers  show them how to find the answers themselves through design thinking exercises and workshops that encourage alignment   Exercises and workshops are some of the most effective tools for building consensus because they get people involved  uncover insights that may not come out in everyday conversation  and make stakeholders feel more invested in product success   Some of our team s favorite exercises include   Journey mapping  Map out each step of the user s journey and how they interact with your product over time and across channels  This is an amazing exercise for identifying and prioritizing opportunities for improvement   Map out each step of the user s journey and how they interact with your product over time and across channels  This is an amazing exercise for identifying and prioritizing opportunities for improvement  Empathy mapping  Design thinking starts with empathy  Empathy maps help teams better understand their users by brainstorming user feelings  influences  tasks  pain points  and goals  Repeat this exercise for a typical user in each of your customer segments  then refer to the empathy maps as a resource for user focused decision making and identifying jobs to be done   Empathy maps help teams better understand their users by brainstorming user feelings  influences  tasks  pain points  and goals  Repeat this exercise for a typical user in each of your customer segments  then refer to the empathy maps as a resource for user focused decision making and identifying jobs to be done  Pair sketching  Pair sketching brings together at least 2 stakeholders  designer   another designer  developer  user  subject matter expert  client  or other stakeholder  to join forces on a product sketch  This collaborative design approach makes it easy to share knowledge and iterate quickly to find the best solution   Every UX disagreement is an opportunity  Getting pushback may seem like an obstacle  but it s actually an opportunity to show your value  Whether you re an in house designer pitching a small idea to a skeptical crowd  or Elon Musk designing products that are changing the world  you re bound to encounter someone who disagrees with you  It s about how you overcome those hurdles that really counts   With a  Design Success   User Success  mindset  an iterative process with multiple usability testing touchpoints  and an arsenal of collaborative exercises  you ll have the tools needed to be a seasoned designed thinker who brings stakeholders together and creates products that guide your users and your company to greatness   This post was originally published on design org   Keep reading

166,training-dataset/product/1389.txt,product,The creative part of UI design  Adding characters and styleThis is an excerpt from Fundamental UI design  an InVision e course by Jane Portman   After long hours spent solving UX challenges and crafting wireframes  we finally arrive at the interesting part  the visual design itself    Our minds say that so long as the design works well  the work s appearance does not necessarily matter  And yet  our hearts say otherwise  No matter how rational our thinking  we hear a voice whisper that beauty has an important role to play     Frank Chimero   The Shape of Design   Outsiders often think that the fonts and colors are the core of a designer s job  but it s not like that  It s like the top of the iceberg  the mere 20  of all hard thinking and planning   However  this part is the most subjective  and it s often challenging   Eliminating the creative stress   Aiming to send over the layouts by Monday    Friday night  and you re sitting there  canvas half empty  unable to come up with a design solution   Ever been there   A designer is expected to come up with some creative output  It s a common misconception of entire design industry  That alone  combined with a tight deadline  can cause unnecessary stress and fear of rejection  These  in turn  block creativity  productivity  and intellect   What can you do to cut this stress to a minimum   First  use wireframes  They do a fantastic job of prepping the client as well as yourself  Wireframes funnel down the client s vision into a collaborative mode  The client s much more likely to sign off something they helped create   Second  don t wait to get started until you have a genius idea  Don t fear a white canvas  Instead  start crafting your UI layout like you d build a house  Draw up the basic elements to match the wireframes  Use basic fonts and pick appropriate icons that communicate the meaning well   The smart visual solution will emerge from the basic elements  You ll gradually figure out a way to make them shine   Working on the style concepts  It s always thrilling to present the look and feel of an app to a client  It s almost like going on a first date with someone   Over the years  my process boiled down to the following  I present 2 style concepts of an app to the client  Each includes layouts for a few key screens  framed as a tiny presentation   I do the main design work on a single style concept  This takes the majority of time  as I m solving the remaining UX challenges and adding visual flair  Then I take these first set of layouts and do something dramatic  Sometimes it s swapping the color scheme from white to black  sometimes it s completely changing the typeface or adding a prominent illustration   Those 2 concepts should be somehow different in functionality or layout so that the client doesn t perceive them as just a different color scheme  For example  if you re using full bleed photo background to present the first one  then you can strip everything off for the second concept for a minimalist  edgy look   Related  These 5 major UI mistakes will kill your app  Make sure you enjoy this design exercise  Working on several layouts actually improves the functionality and the quality of each one  It also keeps your creative juices flowing between other mundane tasks   With Airstory  the founders had 2 style concepts to choose from  In addition to the actual screens  2 3 per option   I put together 2 small presentations that went beyond actual UI and explained the creative direction behind it  The founders went with the first style option   The second concept was also worth attention  It provided a lightweight look and featured a more interesting typeface  as opposed to the classic Proxima Nova   This concept was more romantic and opinionated  It was a possibility that one of the founders could go for it  Even if not selected  it provided nice contrast and highlighted the versatility of the first concept  making it more desirable   Getting visual inspiration  Browsing sites like Dribbble is great for getting some fresh design inspiration   I must admit this rarely feeds effective solutions in terms of usability  Each app usually solves a unique problem  But browsing through the trending work will give you a solid idea of what s hot today  It ll energize and motivate you to create outstanding work   Never go blatantly copying the work of other designers  But it really helps to pick apart the designs and see what can be adopted in your own design  especially style wise   Style references and preferences  If you interviewed your client well  then you probably have enough style references to understand their taste  But you shouldn t take this as a dogma   You re the professional in charge  and you can allow reasonable deviations from the task  Even if the client wished for a  white ish  interface  it s sometimes necessary to add dark contrasting elements for usability and visual interest   Plus  try to address different style preferences with different style concepts  One can be more traditional  and the other can be pushing the envelope a bit  You never know how exactly the client feels about their new product until they see your work   Related  Designers share the worst client feedback they ve ever gotten  Conservative or playful   Don t take creativity as a chore  Your UI doesn t need to make a dramatic statement  Before anything  your UI should be a convenient subtle shell people use daily   But please don t fear design experiments and bold decisions   After you crafted the basic components of your interface  don t be afraid to bring more personality into the look   You can go playful by adding informal illustrations or occasional hand written decorative fonts just please use both sparingly  Or you can go edgy and minimal by picking an interesting high contrast color scheme and cutting down on decorations   Learn to be playful at times  while being conservative in serious situations  Disco by Copy Hackers featured plenty of illustration as part of their brand  But the widget itself remained neutral in design it needed to be placed on various websites   Keep experimenting with your style  With visual design  it s easy to fall into the trap of using a few safe choices that have already worked for you multiple times   This can be called your signature style  But you should be brave enough to deviate from your trusted techniques and experiment with new styles and visual choices    It s not enough to rest on your artistic laurels or to simply do what s been done before  That sort of laziness leads to stagnation and creative death  Question your art relentlessly     Paul Jarvis   The Good Creative   Style checklist  No matter what style you go after  make sure you answer  yes  to the following questions   Does the style match the personality of the product owner   Does the style feel organic with the target audience   Do your choices cater for comfortable use of the app   This quick sanity check will save you a lot of worries afterwards   Building visual interest from scratch  You can t really qualify good UI design as beautiful there s much more to it than just pure aesthetic beauty  What we consider beautiful in the software industry is essentially a combination of usability and visual interest   As a designer  your task is to create a harmonic experience for the eyes  and to provide interesting material for them to peruse   Even though most apps are purely utilitarian and not for entertainment  they don t have to look boring   Creating rules and breaking them  Visual interest doesn t mean noise  complexity  or richness in detail  It has more to do with a clear structure that has certain deviations  which evoke human curiosity   As designers  we re telling a story with our UI  We want to make this story interesting   First we create a harmonious structure based on balance and patterns  such as groups of similar elements   Then we intentionally allow moderate deviations that draw the eye  some of them occur naturally through a variety of content  and some of them are intentional  like alternating backgrounds  headlines  etc    Pattern gives the eye a repetitive  balanced experience  It helps to organize the natural noise of content into a structure that s comfortable to view   Contrast creates dynamics  You can apply contrast in color  texture  size  or shape  You ll likely use most of them   Before anything  use actual information to craft nice visual structure cards  tables  and feeds  Then you can add interest with traditional design elements   colors  typography  icons  charts and graphs  photography and illustration  Let s walk through them with some tips and instructions   Color scheme  Picking a color scheme might seem difficult  But really  you just need 2 interesting colors to create entire color scheme for an app  And it should be based on a nice contrast   First  pick a base color something that has actual color in it like a dark neutral blue or a muted purple  You ll use this color as a background for remaining elements   Hint  this color should be a nice contrasting background either for white or for black elements  so make sure it s light enough or dark enough   Second  pick a brighter contrasting color for your calls to action  like buttons or icons  It can be any bright shade like red  orange  green  or blue  It should stand well against your base color and preferably against white as well   Then you ll use various shades of white and black  White is a perfect background for large amounts of content  and black is great for readability   Hint  dark shades of gray like 90  or 80  still look like black but are more comfortable to the eye and provide a more sophisticated look   Don t neglect traditional color coding  Red is the color for alerts and errors  Green indicates that something has been completed successfully   With your base color scheme  you need to make sure that these positive or negative alerts don t get lost in the visual noise  Of course you still can use red or green as your base colors just keep this little fact in mind   This Ryvalry app prototype created for Eric Shamlin features a rich red color  which looks even more prominent in contrast with white   Typography  Contrast is your best friend when it comes to typography   A large line of bold text accompanied by a smaller line of additional info is a classic contrast that works in all situations  Use it in your information cards all of them have a title line  Even a plain wall of text has a headline and a subhead   Very large numerals are your lifesavers when you don t have any other visuals for your dashboard   Related  Typography tips for a more comfortable read  Small type is another magic tool  People usually read post scripts and small notes with much better attention than the main body of text  Appropriate comments set in a smaller font with a subtly lighter font color will make any person naturally curious   Icons  Icons are a unique type of illustration that are used in UI for many purposes  They add tons of visual interest  They denote the most common actions instead of words and help you save precious screen space   They also help create visual interest when there s none without adding noise   You can use icons in a few basic ways   Inline   their size should be the same as the font size    their size should be the same as the font size Large   they can precede an entire paragraph or a content block    they can precede an entire paragraph or a content block Oversized  set in a subtle color like pale gray and accompanied by a small text note  they fill in blank slates well  Custom icons are fantastic  but there s nothing bad about using stock icons   Photography and illustration  Photography and illustration are primarily used on sales pages and in brand presentation  but they can make way into the actual interface as well   You can use small blocks of illustration to accompany notes or bits of information on a dashboard  You can use full bleed muted photography for blank slates or profile backgrounds   Pay special attention to complex vector illustrations  You can pull them apart and sprinkle separate elements across your UI and sales pages   Stock resources are a flaky thing  Finding good content is like digging soil for rare pellets of gold  You need plenty of time and really good taste  But it s absolutely worth the effort because   You still save time  as compared to custom illustration or photography  Stock resources are available for a fraction of a price  You see the result instantly without any trouble or risk  You can experiment with a few options at once  even with watermarked previews  However  custom photography and illustration will make your project totally unique and memorable  You just need to weigh the cons and pros   Profile pictures are your free design bonus  You don t need any effort to acquire them  However  keep in mind that they can be terribly inconsistent  not pretty  or downright missing  So put in a few extra minutes to design a pretty placeholder   In this Disco prototype by Copy Hackers  we added playful illustrative elements right into the interface  Have a look at the clouds and the balloon that decorate the app dashboard   Charts and graphs  Charts and diagrams are great for dashboards and profile pages  They take simple numeral data and generate visually rich  informative insights   There are plenty of libraries out there  but they often look quite spartan  As a designer  you can customize the defaults for a posh  sophisticated look   Some tips   Keep the colors and fonts consistent with your app  Donut charts look prettier than pie charts  Try removing the grid and making the trend line thicker for a pretty trend view  Charts usually have weird shapes  place them on light rectangle backgrounds to keep overall page structure consistent  Charts are typically empty during the first app experience  so consider replacing them with blank slate placeholders  The final word of caution  Don t be an overachiever in the battle for visual interest  Too much stuff results in visual noise  and we don t want that to happen   So be wise  and aim for clarity and user comfort first   Living in the era of flat design   Being ruthless in our design decisions and allowing only the most important and most relevant items to be kept means we will ultimately end up with a better  more usable product in the end     Shawn Blanc   Delight is in the Details   We re all extremely lucky to live in the era of flat  minimal design   The audience  and the clients  have matured enough  They re ready to use and to enjoy minimal interfaces not just because it s trendy  but because they ve used enough of them already   It s amazing   Designers have always had a passion for minimal layouts that are purely graphical  But it s been an uphill battle to try and sign them off with clients   Sure  senior designers had the power and respect to produce minimal layouts  But  ordinary  designers were often asked for something more decorative   If I presented one of today s trending flat interfaces to a client 5 years ago  I d sure have a lot of trouble getting it signed off  So we used plenty of gloss  gradients  textures  and other things that have become obsolete today   The reasons behind flat design  Flat design is not a purely aesthetic trend  We re already a few decades into using graphical UIs  from desktop computers to tablets and phones   Initially the idea of a familiar physical object helped us to interact with software  Such UI terms as desktop  window  wallpaper  notebook  and even menu  are good reminders of this   Today  the paradigm of human computer interaction has baked well enough into our minds  We can finally get rid of these older skeuomorphic concepts  They re not necessary anymore   A typical user is familiar with common UI layouts and navigation patterns  A modern user can scroll and swipe easily  without any complex page turn animations or whatever else we used to impress and guide them along   Flat designs are also much faster to craft no need to spend extra time on textures and decorations  Plus  they re much faster to build for the same reason   But why does it look so good   By definition of flat design  we should strip off anything that s not functional  However  that doesn t mean there s no decoration at all  Actually  things get quite intricate at times  It s just another style of decor   Here s how you can add interest to any flat UI   Color contrast  Typographic contrast  large vs small  bold vs light   Patterns  especially subtle ones use them as textures   Typical  flat  illustrations and icons  Smart interactions and animations  they re easier to implement with basic geometric shapes which are prevalent in flat design  Surprisingly  one of your biggest helpers in flat design is good ol  drop shadow it s a great way to give a feeling of depth  Use these extra layers to create meaningful visual hierarchy  your cards or menu bars can be placed on top of the main workspace   Implementation troubles  When it s time to code up your design into a live app  minimalism has a lot of benefits  Faster deployment and an overall clean structure are a couple of benefits  But it also breeds its own implications   Did you know that trim is used in construction work to hide imperfections  Now imagine the minimal layout being a room stripped of all decorative trimmings  To look good  it has to be built with extreme precision and accuracy   Flat layouts are based on the harmony of colors  typography  and whitespace  All of this can be ruined easily with a careless CSS setting  Not by the evil intention  of course but the output may be still unflattering   How do you deal with this  As usual  it s great to run a design checkup after deploying the UI  Use your own design eye to see what went wrong and help the developer fix these problems   Your flat design checklist  When the interface is stripped down to bare necessities  typical UX problems can become even more obvious  Moreover  you risk stripping off too much  which makes action elements unrecognizable  That s a huge usability risk   Here s your go to checklist   Make clickable elements stand out  Use bright colors for call to action elements  and stick to traditional button shapes to define clickable areas   In the absence of borders and textures  use plenty of white space to isolate elements and define a clear visual structure   Don t rely on subtle details to convey meaning   Make sure your typography and color contrast is dramatic enough   Stick to the classic rules  Design history shows that design trends often run from one extreme to the other  A few years ago we observed a transition from decorative and skeuomorphic design towards flat   It doesn t take much wit to predict that the flat trend won t stay forever  No matter how flat you go with your layouts  make sure to follow the classic rules of design  This is your entry ticket to a new era whenever the style pendulum swings   The power of UI presentation  Your UI work might be amazing  but it s worth nothing if you don t sell it right  By selling it  I mean signing it off with a client or showing it off in your portfolio to lure followers and future clients   To do that  you need to show it off  We ve talked usability first  beauty second  but people still love eye candy  Pretty presentation is like a cherry on top of your UI design skills   My use of the phrases  making things pretty  and  eye candy  doesn t mean I m devaluing the deeply intellectual essence of UI design  It s just another way to conquer the heart of your audience  It s not a reason you should be neglecting these little presentation tricks   It does take additional effort  for sure  But the return on such time investment is enormous   Showcase the brand  You re not a brand designer  But any software product represents its own brand   Visually  it s a logo  a color scheme  a set of stylistic elements  specific typography  photography  and illustration  Intangibly  it s the mood  the spirit  and core values of your product   A simple sequence of screens conveys the functional side of things  but you can give additional treatment to show off the branding that surrounds it   This is an exercise in creative direction  You re going a step further to show the client how the product will be displayed and marketed later   You can present your screens against a contrast background  featuring the logo at a larger scale  You can add related photography or illustration that s not included in the UI but might easily be used within a sales page   It s a great practice to design both the sales page and the product UI at the same time  If the timeframe is too tight  you can put together 1 or 2 purely presentational layouts that look like a hero section of a web page  It s less work than a whole page  yet results in a similar effect   It s going to be a thoughtful still life composition that features your screens and gives plenty of branding information beyond   Use appropriate placeholder content  Thoughtful sample content often goes unnoticed  But the opposite can easily be a sign of an amateur designer  Have you ever seen a bulleted list of 5 identical lines  or an address book with 10 entries of the same exact person  Then you know what we re talking about   Design is a very subjective matter  while sample content is one of the few things that the client can actually rationalize  Rest assured they ll read all your placeholder text and they might even ask questions about it   It doesn t take any longer than 20 minutes to diversify the content entries  Think of some random names and source a few suitable images  If you re redesigning an existing app  just scout one of the pages and pull recent entries from there   It helps to have a tiny library of stock portraits of people to use across all your projects  I also tend to have a few imaginary names that I love to use instead of John Doe in my projects  It might sound silly at first  but it saves a few minutes of thinking and adds a personal touch to your workflow   This screenshot from the Egghead io web interface features some nice sample content  There s a good  natural variety of content entries  You should also account for image placeholders when users don t have a profile pic   Select the right screens  When showing a set of screens  curate a small number of them that really depict key functionality  Usually 3 5 screens do the trick   At the same time  make sure the screens you select represent the look and feel of the app  include all the basic elements  and give an idea of the most typical user workflow   Use device images  Device images are the gold mine of UI presentation   If you worked in logo creation and branding  then you know how important it is to select appropriate physical objects for the showcase   In UI design  it s a no brainer  Just place your layouts into a device mockup  and things instantly get magical  You get context  visual interest  and style direction all in one   There s a plethora of free device mockups available online  Some are photo realistic 3D renderings or illustrations  and some are plain vector outlines   If you have a flat UI  it might seem natural to showcase it on a flat device image  For the best result  however  try the opposite  Show flat layouts on a photorealistic device   Add interesting details  Go further and add more interesting elements for 100  eye candy  Things to try   Decompose your UI into separate layers and showcase them at an angle  Add zoom circles to highlight the most interesting parts of the interface  Use arrows and call outs with informative comments  Use hands and fingers to add visual interest and pinpoint key controls  These elements won t just make things pretty  but they ll also help get your point across   These presentation screens are from the Nova flash photo taking app  They feature some interesting add ons  zoom areas and call outs  supplied with meaningful comments   Supply value based comments    Explain your design decisions  design problems  and design process  This will help eliminate a lot of questions further on  build collaborative spirit  and it ll give better value to your work   If you suggest a fresh alternative  explain why the older version didn t work  Tell what else you tried on the way to this solution   You can sometimes mirror the exact words of your client in your comments  This will unconsciously demonstrate that the result of your work complies with their requirements   Never justify your decisions for purely aesthetic reasons  Remember  your product doesn t exist in isolation it s functioning due to purely economical reasons   Therefore  build your comments on the ultimate benefits for the client and for the customers   Black will resonate well with the audience of hair stylists  is always better than  black looks more dramatic    Always remember that your client pays large amounts of money for your UI UX expertise  The whopping 80  goes for your intellect  and just 20  for your artistic talent  When showing the results of your work  make sure you demonstrate a great return on your client s investment   Keep reading  Want to learn more  Get

176,training-dataset/product/74.txt,product,Ways We WorkNadine Hare  Resident Anthropologist at Idea Couture  Working as an applied anthropologist means working within tensions  tensions between strategy  design  anthropology and corporate interests  From my perspective  both anthropologists and strategist are ideally involved in the whole process  from building proposals  to research  to developing deliverables  When the anthropologist is back from the field  she start developing a narrative which should speak to the experiences she saw in the field while being in dialogue with the client s business questions  objectives  and hypotheses  A big part of what happens when I come back from the field takes place in the dialogue between anthropologist and strategist  we ll have some sort of exchange  I ll go away and write and then we ll talk some more  and I ll come back with something I feel good about  The strategist will push or challenge me  They ll tell me   this needs to be stronger   or  this is going to be interesting to a client  and this is going to be less interesting    This cooperation between the strategist and anthropologist helps shape the research so that it challenges clients assumptions while still being accessible to them  There has to be a balance between fitting enough in a framework so that it s legible  but pushing this framework enough so that the work we do helps the client deconstruct past assumptions and offers interesting insight into people s lives  My aim is to offer a critical lens on the narrative they ve built about the people they deal with  their clients  and the consumers of their products   I also work with designers on what we call journey maps  Journey maps are a visual representation of a part of the experience  Designers  strategists and anthropologists develop this map together  Designers speak to what is visually possible and interesting to represent so that they can create the tools that we use to help clients understand the journey  make strategic decisions  or even just to socialize insights in their organization  The anthropologist tries to make sure that everything being built is in line with the larger story we re telling and is representative of the stories she heard in the field  The strategist speaks to how this tool will be valuable for the client  and what needs to be at the forefront to make it strategically useful  This is another key tension that is part and parcel of the work that we do  being part of the dance between designers  strategists and anthropologists  representing complexity and nuance in the story we want to tell while still creating something that is viable and useful on the strategists end  and creating something that is doable  visually accessible and interesting on the design front  Bringing these three voices together is a really interesting moment  If you imagine this as sort of a triangle  what we create is something that lives in the middle of these three points and brings them together   I think these tensions are something that makes the work at Idea Couture so valuable  Our findings are deep and complex  but still accessible and useful  Without the anthropologist having a say in these conversations  we risk losing the depth and complexity that brings so much to the work that we offer  Social life is complex  Even though people don t want it to be and want a simple answer  there isn t always one  The value of this whole process is being in those tensions and using them productively  Being in those tensions and working with and from those tensions is for me the way in which good research in this field can be done,"[176 867 387 604 1094 1137 873 166 1322 434 271]"
188,training-dataset/product/1441.txt,product,How to run data driven usability testing sessionsEvery product manager and UX designer has different opinions and notions about how a design will work and how people will interact with the product  But if it hasn t been tested or proven  it s merely an opinion   In today s crowded  attention grabbing product landscape  you can t afford to be led by guessing  There s too much competition  and people no longer tolerate a lack of functionality   Research shows that people have around a 7 second attention span before they decide if they want to leave or stay on your website   With that in mind  improving your usability with user testing should be a priority   In his now mythical article  Usability pioneer Jakob Nielsen coined the core definition of usability and usability testing    On the Web  usability is a necessary condition for survival  If a website is difficult to use  people leave  If the homepage fails to clearly state what a company offers and what users can do on the site  people leave  If users get lost on a website  they leave  If a website s information is hard to read or doesn t answer users  key questions  they leave  Note a pattern here    Jakob Nielsen  Nielsen claims that in order to compete in the jungle that is the internet  you have to provide the best experience for your users  And to do that  you have to understand their needs in the best  most intuitive way   You can provide the solution to their problems as a result from testing their experience and constantly optimizing based on their feedback and usability   Aren t analytics enough   There are a lot of analytics software and platforms that try to help you understand your users  behavior  But as good as those tools might be  most of them focus on the user s actions  not on the experience itself   They reflect on decisions that users have made but miss out on the entire experience and decision making process   User testing  on the other hand  is 100  focused on the experience and process itself   This is an effective approach  and it gives valuable insights that couldn t be described with numbers  It s a qualitative   feelings  based approach that helps you hone your intuition and have a better understanding of your users   The intuitive  qualitative approach is very much in line with the idea of user experience and product design in a user centered environment   To improve the users  experience  see users as individuals with unexpected behaviors and patterns  not as numbers on a statistical chart   In another article  Nielsen states and shows statistically  oh  the irony   that having around 5 8 users is enough for user testing   In short  Nielsen proves how you can get the most value out of testing with 3 users or less  With more than 6  the accumulative learning curve isn t worth the resources most companies spent on it   The idea that a smaller testing sample is better than a larger one contradicts some basic principles in data that state that statistical significance has a higher value over individual experience   Analytics and user testing are both data  Data driven decision making is one of the biggest trends in startup and design culture right now   Still  it s a common mistake to think that quality data is mainly about user interviews and that it s mostly relevant to that pre product market fit phase   Big numbers are the data most companies rely on  But you shouldn t forget that user testing still qualifies as data valuable data  in fact   If we understand that both approaches play an important role in design and product management  we can then harness them to our advantage and fuse them   Quantitative data is great for discovering trends  but quality data can give you a more in depth look into what motivates users  which can help you uncover deeper reasoning for the numeric trend you are tracking   Knowing how to analyze both types of data will empower you to get a better understanding of your users and of the LTV results   Physical testing versus user session recording usability testing  The common approach to user testing has 3 main steps   Find participants that fit your target audience  Get them to perform common tasks on your product  Observe them as they perform these tasks and gather insights on their usability and experience   The idea behind these 3 steps is to   Make sure you re testing the right audience  Your product or website should fit your target audience there s no point in optimizing for people who aren t relevant  Provide a set of actions everyone has to do in order to find patterns or general notions Learn and analyze based on what they ve done  Every user testing method goes through these steps   In terms of how you test  there are 2 popular ways   Physical user testing Digital user testing  user session recordings   A physical usability test is based on you meeting your existing or potential users  Observe them as they go through a set of predefined tasks and learn from your observations   A digital usability test will be based on using user session recordings  You won t meet your users  but you ll be able to see their actions via the video sessions recorded   A user session recording allows you to watch users as they interact with your product  It differs from traditional user testing since you can t interact with the user and give them instructions  However  it has a big advantage  The user is unaware  so there s no distortion of their behavior   Now let s talk about how to use data to conduct user testing in both methods   The data driven approach to running your usability test  Data driven user testing is similar to the 2 approaches mentioned above  but now we ll choose the users based on data   Find users who fit your target audience  The first step is finding the right user to run your test   Whether you chose the first or second approach  you first need to create a very comprehensive persona   Creating a persona is the key to running a relevant user testing session and understanding who your real target audience is  It s essential for improving your design and product   Building your perfect persona is also a key element when choosing who to run your usability tests with   By knowing who you want to target  you can segment your audience on both user recording tools and analytics tools in a meaningful way  Of course  you can use analytics to refine your persona  and this is an iterative process of optimization between your persona and your on site data   Once you have the persona  start using it  Create a segment based on age  location  gender  interest  online behavior  marital status  etc   Now it s time to choose the right people for your next usability test   For physical testing  Dig into your data and segment your users based on LTV  lifetime value  and their match as  good users   The behavioral segmentation can be done by loyal users  or by users who renewed their subscription   Moreover  you can also choose users who signed up and didn t convert from free to paying users  if you re a freemium product  in order to understand why they didn t convert   Use your analytics tool to filter those qualified users and then learn more about them  You can dig even deeper and segment by demographics  and so on   Now you re able to invite people to run your usability tests based on results matching your persona with actual users segmented from your analytics   For user recording sessions  The process here is reversed  If you re using session recordings  it means you already have your tests recorded  You now have to segment the sessions you want to review based on the persona you ve created   User recording tools allow you to segment your audience based on traffic sources  demographics  behavior  and actions   This means you can watch countless hours of your persona s behavior on your site  without having to lift a finger or pay the high sums that traditional user testing requires   You can make sure you re not going to optimize for the wrong crowd by segmenting based on your persona   Running the test  For physical testing  This is the tricky part  There are many rules you need to follow as an observer in order to avoid corrupting your results   You have to reduce your interaction to a minimum and do the best that you can so you won t interfere with how your user behaves   You can take 2 approaches to running the test   Create a set of predefined tasks a user needs to follow through  then observe how they perform those tasks and spot potential friction points Give them a general direction of what they should do and watch them behave within the platform  The good thing here is that you can direct them towards the area feature you would like to test  The bad thing is that your users will try to perform for you  so they ll be driven unnaturally   If you re going for the predefined tasks  use the funnels in the digital tools to create your user testing scenario  By doing so  you ll make sure you re watching them as they re running through the most common flows of your product  thus focusing on the most important aspects   You can also add a scenario which you d want to see more of  but isn t shown on your data  This might show you the reason for why this scenario isn t happening in real world   In both cases you ll need to run the test several times with many different samples  which can be time consuming   For user recording sessions  Running the test with user recording sessions is easier since you aren t really conducting a test  but reviewing existing behaviors and segmenting them by specific needs   If there s a certain area in your product that you d like to test  you just have to look back at the recordings that show the users who engaged with that area   If some follow up questions arise  you can view additional sessions and other interactions to get the full picture   Simply go into your user session recording platform and filter users based on either URLs or specific CTAs  You can even segment them by sources to test the different behaviors on your product based on source something that you can t do with physical user testing   Analyzing your results  When it comes to analyzing your tests  there s no difference between the 2 methods since the focus is on the measuring and result gathering method from observing how a user behaves   Turning qualitative results into insights can be done 2 ways   Numeric  Quantifying different parameters Depth  How frustrating or how great was the experience you ve witnessed   Numeric  Create ready made criteria to fill in as your users perform and give each action a point based on difficulty and friction  This means you ll be able to quantify their experience by adding the points altogether   If you re looking for a system usability scale  SUS  to evaluate the usability of your website  try this one  But I recommend that you build your own scale based on your needs and priorities  You can also read Lean Analytics for an in depth explanation on how to create your criteria and measurement system   Depth  This system is preserved only for the situation where you can conduct user interviews with your usability testing  You can do it by interviewing your users after the physical test  or by contacting your users based on a user session recording that fits your needs   You want to see how passionate or frustrated your users are by a certain design or product feature  Sometimes they can handle the current flow but later you ll find out they actually hate it  Maybe they re passionate for a flow that didn t make sense to you  but they love it   It s not just about  how many people do X  it s also about the volume of the sentiment   Summary  In a user centered world  optimizing your product based on the user s experience and feedback is a necessity  Use data in your user testing and you ll be making smarter decisions  focusing your questions  and constantly optimizing based on results   Your intuition is important  but base your intuition on data   How do you conduct user testing  Which

231,training-dataset/product/1393.txt,product,Why 5 is the magic number for UX usability testingThe research needed to create a flawless user experience is of greater importance than ever  but there remains a lot of confusion surrounding the process of usability testing   In depth research is one thing  but having actual tests to check the solidity of your design is just as important  Many people and companies shy away from the practice of usability testing  believing it involves a lot of resources and expenses  And while others understand that it doesn t have to be expensive or time consuming  they still don t get it completely right and overcomplicate things rendering their usability tests less useful than they could be   In reality  the best results come from stringing together many smaller tests that include 5 users at a time   Why is usability testing important   Because user experience is a such a large field and UX designers are charged with the giant task of building a pleasing  overall experience   flaws are a natural and often unavoidable part of the design process   Remember the HealthCare gov launch  It was an info dense hellstorm of a website that was consistently abandoned by frustrated users  Despite a well designed  simple wireframe with clearly labeled information and a navigable structure  the deeper people got into the process of finding insurance  the more complicated their experience became   The highlight of this failure was an overblown security process that took up to 60 minutes to complete  leaving users to scramble for alternatives  Situated Research found that  the early stages of application on HealthCare gov look simple  and encourage users to begin an application  however  the reality is a long process with difficulties that waste users  time and a delayed gratification of shopping for coverage    Usability testing is the number one tool for making sure these usability flaws don t happen  Without proper usability testing  the result for HealthCare gov led to nationwide difficulty in obtaining insurance through the public marketplace and boatloads of public bashing  but that all could have been easily avoided  Despite popular misconceptions about how cumbersome this process is  you really only need 5 test users per testing group to make sure your product offers a smooth experience   What s so magical about the number 5   Given that the probability of a user encountering an error during testing is 31   according to Jeff Sauro of MeasuringU  testing just 5 users would turn up 85  of the problems in an interface  This conclusion is brought to you by binomial probability  or what may be better known as the Poisson Distribution which can show us the chances of achieving n successes in N trials  A Poisson Distribution with a 31  binomial probability shows that once you add more than 5 users to a test group  returns diminish drastically the more users you add to a test group  the less you ll learn   If you have 3 test users  you ll catch about 65  of the problems  With 4 users you ll catch 75   and with 5 you ll catch 85   Once you cross the threshold at 5 and begin to add more test users  the increase of issues that you ll uncover reduces  With 6  you ll catch 90  of the issues  with 8  you ll catch 95   and with 12  you ll catch 99    These diminishing returns are due to the fact that user experiences overlap  According to the Nielsen Norman Group   As soon as you collect data from a single test user  your insights shoot up and you have already learned almost a third of all there is to know about the usability of the design  When you test the second user  you will discover that this person does some of the same things as the first user   People are definitely different  so there will also be something new that the second user does that you didn t observe with the first user   The third user will do many things that you already observed  Plus  of course  the third user will generate a small amount of new data  even if not as much as the first and second user did    The amount of new data collected decreases with each test user and flattens out most prominently at 5 test users  making 5 users the right size for the right value   Research difficulties  A word of caution  Don t fetishize the numbers here by solely focusing on your test users  quantitatively recorded feedback  The qualitative experience of your users is critical your test users will struggle with a certain aspect of your website  and understanding why and working with them to brainstorm solutions is essential   For example  perhaps your test users found the shift in color scheme from the homepage to the signup screen jarring  Instead of only receiving some vague quantification of the color scheme issues  you can prompt users to explain  The blue used for the navigation bar on the homepage is too similar to the blue on the signup screen s continue button  That s any easy fix   At the same time  getting the most out of your 5 test users in a research session requires a specific skillset  so your demeanor and positioning in relation to the test user is key  No test user wants someone hovering over them  asking leading questions  and appearing hurt when criticism is voiced  Conduct yourself accordingly  No test user will respond candidly in an uncomfortable setting  Put test users at ease by opening with an informal chat  start the meeting by clearly explaining your goals  and continue to speak conversationally with curiosity as your main motivation  How did you feel about X  Why did Y make you feel Z   The controversy  No one doubts the accuracy of the Poisson Distribution  but there s some controversy surrounding the use of 31  as the average problem frequency  While 31  is a problem frequency that has been derived from many studies  only very new active websites and applications may be so vulnerable  More streamlined and polished products may  in fact  have a much lower problem frequency  For instance  let s say one issue will only affect 5  of the population  According to binomial probability  this new frequency would change the number of users necessary to find the problem   As a baseline  5 is still the golden rule in UX usability testing   Of course  it s impossible to know the probability of discovery for every potential problem  According to MeasuringU   As a strategy  pick some percentage of problem occurrence  say 20   and likelihood of discovery  say 85   which would mean you d need to plan on testing 9 users   After testing 9 users  you d know you ve seen most of the problems that affect 20  or more of the users  If you need to be surer of the findings  then increase the likelihood of discovery  for example  to 95   Doing so would increase your required sample size to 13    Any number of factors the level of refinement of your website  the size of your user base  or likelihood of discovery for a problem can change your magic number for usability testing drastically   As a baseline  though  5 is still the golden rule  Limit testing to 5 users and you ll uncover the majority of problems that plague your website or app  while still keeping your costs low and the process simple,"[231 188 891 1259 1322 1337 341 461 1388 145 618]"
260,training-dataset/product/452.txt,product,Design principles  what to do when nobody is using your featureWhen we released our new messenger last year  we added the ability for customers to create rich  personal profiles so their users would always know there s a real person on the other end  The problem  Nobody was using the feature  Shortly after release  only 13 15  of customers had fully completed their profiles  Most were being partially filled in while many others were left untouched   An example of a partial and fully completed profile After talking with colleagues on our research and analytics teams  we uncovered two primary reasons for such low adoption  Visibility  The ability to create your profile was tucked away in low visibility places throughout the app  Education  People were unconvinced of the importance of profiles in establishing a personal relationship with their customers  One part of a wider solution Profiles lived across many parts of the Intercom product which meant that we had to involve many teams to increase adoption  The growth team integrated profile creation into our on boarding flow  while product gave higher visibility to profile editing within Intercom itself  However  there was a huge opportunity to increase engagement by taking advantage of our mobile apps  Around 45  of teammates who talk with their customers  using our Resolve product  use either the Android or iOS app  Getting started For every new project  designers at Intercom create a simple list of high level goals that reference the problem they re trying to tackle  This helps guide you when thinking of high level solutions  Ours looked something like this  Raise adoption for users who have not completed or partially completed their profile  Educate users on the importance of public profiles  Make it easy for users to edit their profile at any time  Thinking in systems To start off  we took the profiles apart to help the team understand the system and to decide which specific components needed priority  That meant mapping out an inventory of parts  states  rulesets  etc  Here s an example of something that would have been up on the wall in our war room   Ideas come from anywhere These system docs helped the team discuss technical constraints early on  and even at this early stage the engineering team was offering suggestions that the design team might not have thought of  For example  someone mentioned that we could draw from existing data sources to pre populate certain components within the profile  Since we have a person s name when they log into the mobile app  why not carry it over to the profile and save them the time of manually entering in that data  After sketching out a few directions  we met with Emmet  our Director of Product Design  to get feedback and decide on next steps  Here were the four options that were presented           The crucial ingredients here were disruption and education  We didn t want this to be too easily dismissible  and we needed room to properly educate users on the importance of the profile and each of it s components  However  we knew high disruption meant more aversion  i e  users wanting to skip   so we wanted to keep the number of steps within any walkthrough as low as possible  In the end  we decided to go with the simple walkthrough option  Below are the decisions from the meeting  Progress   Designing the solution At this point  we had decided two things  We would add a simple walkthrough to our app on startup which would ask for any missing profile components to be filled in  disruption and education   Our third goal was adding the ability to  edit your profile from anywhere   We decided to work within our current navigation pattern and add a simple edit icon within the nav drawer which would trigger the walkthrough  Note  One of our core values here at Intercom is  think big  start small   We had been planning a navigation update for a while at this point  Moving from the drawer to the tab bar would be great for a variety of reasons  but would have been a ton of effort engineering wise at the time and we needed to ship fast   Current navigation  left   planned navigation  right  At a system level  we established three states for users which would dictate their position within the walkthrough  From the chosen high level direction  we knew that the the flow would consist of three primary steps  see diagram below  which we wanted to make as easy and lightweight as possible   Walkthroughs are pretty straightforward in terms of system design  They are a fixed pathway from beginning to end  but the logic gets more complex when taking user states into account  We d want you to skip straight to the most relevant part instead of forcing you to go through the entire walkthrough  It s also very important to consider platform specific steps such as camera permissions  Not every step is a new screen  Again  these diagrams were printed out and put up in our war room  Engineers would often be at the wall scouring through the flow  and a few times they would spot an edge case that would require us make changes together   Final flow for the walkthrough Execution By now we had the skeleton to start fleshing out each part  Visual and interaction design happened simultaneously  with the knowledge that we d continue to tweak visuals as we build  We ve found that finalising the details around any complex interactions or animations should be done as soon as possible  which is why high fidelity prototypes are great   It s much harder to change these later on as opposed to visual design tweaks such as updated assets  colours  etc  We used Framer JS as a way to prototype early interaction ideas  discuss with engineering and agree on what could be done  Here s an example of our final iOS flow after around 12 prototypes  From a visual design perspective  our mobile apps already followed closely to our brand  Any new designs need to maintain that language as well as reuse any patterns needed  We worked with our stellar brand design team for illustrations on the intro and confirmation screens   Content was crucial to the education problem  We needed to explain why profiles were important in a concise way  Design worked closely with Elizabeth McGuane  our content strategist  to create a more compelling experience and help users understand why a great profile matters,"[260 1157 555 891 698 573 1291 145 1322 347 166]"
271,training-dataset/product/659.txt,product,How to write a case study that wins you clientsFifty six percent of all hiring managers are more impressed by a candidate s personal website than any other personal branding tool  However  only 7  of job seekers actually have a personal website   Of this minority  very few present case studies that include more than a boring screenshot of their most recent work  Yet case studies are a vital tool that help designers build trust and credibility with prospective clients   Most clients aren t looking to hire a designer just because they want their site or app to look pretty  They re hiring a designer to help them meet a business objective  Good case studies prove that you understand the big picture and the details   In this post  you ll learn the 5 key elements of the best design case studies and you ll get inspired by a few prime examples   5 key elements of good design case studies  1  Executive summary  This is a general overview of the project  It should be short and sweet for the skimmers because only a few conscientious prospects will actually read each project s case study   The content in this section should detail a high level overview of the other sections  including   Main problem  The reason they hired you  The reason they hired you Solution  How you solved the problem  How you solved the problem Key results  What were the deliverables or KPIs   Productivity tip  Write this section last  after you ve written all the content for the other sections   Related  How to design case studies  2  Context and challenge  Next  you should give prospects context into the problem you were hired to solve  You can do this by answering the following questions   a  Project background description  What context information do you have for this job   b  The problem  Why did they hire you   c  Goals and objectives  What were the agreed upon goals of the projects  While difficult sometimes to get  the key here is quantifiable metrics  Think about the tangible goals of the project  Maybe you reduced the number of cart abandonments or your design increased conversions by X    Helpful tip  At the beginning of new projects  make sure these points are clearly articulated to you by the client to save you a headache trying to figure out this section after the project is done and shipped  If you re working on a case study for a completed project  look back to your creative brief  project description  or request for proposal  RFP  to find this information   3  Process  How did you get from the problem to your solution   The process section should describe how you approached solving the client s problem and why you made the decision s  to approach the project this way  It s helpful for prospects because it gives them a glimpse into the experience of working with you   You ll want to present clients with a walkthrough of your research and workflow as well as with iterations at various stages of the process  From the research you present anything from A B tests to user interviews prospects should be able to extract key insights into how you arrived at your findings   Efficiency tip  Try to accumulate as much information about a client s audience as possible  Ask for buyer personas  Talk to support and see what people are asking most frequently  This can save you time  when it comes to developing a key insight to guide your design decisions   4  Solution  Take screenshots  Include links  Record a video  Do anything to showcase your solution in this section   While this is the place to showcase all your hard and beautiful work  it is not the place to skimp on the textual details  Spend time refining clear copy that provides more insights into everything you present   from navigation structure to mobile only attributes   Above and beyond tip  This is the place to truly impress your prospects  Take the extra effort to consider adding a video or interactive features   5  Results  Show them the numbers   This section should showcase your success metrics from the project  Success metrics could be qualitative  a testimonial or press quote   quantitative  KPIs   or better yet  both   It s vital that the metrics results you showcase directly address the objectives you detailed in Section 2  Context and challenge   This proves you directly contributed to the client meeting their big picture goals  This will increase their trust in you and differentiate you as more than just a designer who makes things pretty   In order to be effective  testimonials must be compelling and show that you made a measurable impact on a client s business  Paul Jarvis details 3 types of effective testimonials in the Creative Class   The before and after changes a client experienced from working with you The excellent results they achieved They unexpected value they received from your work  Jarvis also recommends following up a few months after completing the project    Following up a month or 2 after the end of a project is another way to collect more powerful  results driven testimonials  Ask how your work has affected the business  created quantifiable sales spikes  or if there have been other positive changes that speak to the value of your knowledge and services    source   Think ahead tip  Plan the experience of working with you  and build securing client testimonials into your design process so you don t have to ask for them 5 months later  Also  each time you begin a new project  make sure to connect your work to quantifiable business metrics and objectives  This will make your life way easier when it comes time to build your case study later   Tell a compelling story  and the clients will follow  While a good case study presents all of the above  there is no hard and fast rule that you have to include every section and or present your case study in this exact order  I ve seen loads of gorgeous and compelling case studies  yet no 2 tend to look the same because each designer has a unique style and personality   In order to hit my point home  I ve included a list of a few of my favorite case studies below  So what are you waiting for  Get inspired now   This was

274,training-dataset/product/1149.txt,product,4 reasons to invest in UX designThere s still an element of ambiguity around the financial returns of user experience design  This may be due to the amount of time it takes for a UX led approach to  pay off   the relative newness of the field  and awareness about UX design in the mainstream   But companies that fail to invest in this area will find they re soon overtaken by competitors who put users front and center of everything they do   Related  13 impressive statistics on UX  If you re still in doubt about why you should invest in UX design  or  more likely  your executives are the ones in need of convincing   we at The UX School interviewed more than 60 of the world s leading UX experts to get their insights into the return on investment  ROI  of UX design   In this article we ve taken our findings and focused on the 4 main reasons why investment in UX is not only hugely beneficial to organizations of every kind  but actually crucial to their success over the long term   You ll spend less on web development  Research by Dr  Susan Weinschenk revealed that developers spend 50  of their time reworking projects  Look at that like this  50  of a developer s salary is wasted on fixing errors that a UX design process would have weeded out during an earlier iteration  That s a lot of wasted money   But with a UX design process in place  designs are tested and iterated on well before they re handed off to a developer  Changes made during prototyping are easier to make and it s so much cheaper to do so at this earlier stage  As this Forbes article pointed out   According to IBM  code defects are 30 times more expensive to correct than using the right information in the first place  It is extremely unlikely that these coding defects will occur if you choose the UX design    At companies that invest in UX  products get released faster because developers spend their time on projects that need significantly fewer alterations   You ll increase sales  A 2016 design study of 408 different companies found that the more a company invested in and focused on design  the more sales they saw  The companies with the highest investment in UX  referred to as  design unicorns   saw their sales increase by 75   Companies that were less invested in UX  they considered themselves simply  design centric   still saw their sales increase by 60    Even if a company doesn t commit 100  to becoming UX led  even a small investment in this area will lead to increased sales   Why do sales increase  A few reasons   Customers can more easily navigate a site and locate what they re looking for  Customers who are happy interacting with a site are less likely to become frustrated or disengaged  so they re more likely to complete transactions  The product has been created with the target audience in mind and then marketed to them  so the right people find the right products  The buying process has been made as smooth and delightful as possible so that customers return and recommend  Every dollar invested in UX brings  100 in return  This is an average figure  but it s a ROI of an impressive 9 900   How does UX design bring about such a high return  It s a combination of factors  including lower cost of customer acquisition  lower support costs  increased customer retention  and increased market share   We ve seen the results of this in the top 10 companies who lead in customer experience  When compared to their peers  they outperformed the S P index with more than triple the returns   And if you don t invest at all  As we found during the compilation of our white paper  by not investing in UX design we re globally losing billion of dollars in revenue every year and that s in ecommerce alone  This is likely to become a trillion dollar issue over the course of the next 3 years if the current uptake of user centric processes remains as it is   You ll build customer loyalty and increase word of mouth referrals  According to this study  customer experience will overtake price and product as key product differentiators within the next 3 years  Successful companies will be the ones that put their customers first and give them fantastic experiences   There s a reason for this  Happy customers not only spend money and return  they recommend the product to their friends and become loyal users   Harvard Business Review found that satisfied customers are much more likely to recommend a product to their friends via word of mouth  In fact  23  of customers who had a positive experience told 10 or more people about it  That s free advertising from a trusted source  and all because the goals of the business were aligned with the goals of the user   Conclusion  The quality of an experience can be the deciding factor between completing a transaction or giving up halfway  recommending a product to a friend or tweeting about a unsatisfactory interaction  returning to a

280,training-dataset/product/1171.txt,product,The art of presenting creative workAs designers  we re extremely creative and passionate people who pour our hearts and souls into design solutions   But we often lose this passion when we present our concepts to clients  Presenting design work incorrectly can create a vacuum for clients to provide misdirected or overly prescriptive feedback  which in turn leads to subpar final work  Proper presenting skills help clients see our point of view and ultimately allow us to put designs out into the world that we re proud to put our names on  Here are some thoughts for your next presentation   Polish your presentation  Present your work in the best possible light  If it s a still image of a website design  mock it up in an image of an actual computer  If you re sharing your screen  close unneeded windows and present in full screen mode to eliminate distractions and visual noise   Use a well designed presentation template  Don t put too much text in your presentation or your client will spend more time reading your slides instead of listening to what you re saying  When you do use text in your presentation  keep it big and bold for readability   Have one focal point per slide  even if it makes your slide deck longer too much content per slide will only end up overwhelming your audience   Practice going through your presentation once or twice to become familiar with you re going to present each slide it ll help you move seamlessly from slide to slide when you present   Set context  Nothing s worse than an unfocused design review  Setting the appropriate context at the beginning of the meeting will save you a lot of agony down the road   At the beginning of each client meeting  reiterate the project goals  recap their feedback from last time  and set clear objectives for the meeting  This reminds them why they re in the room and what kind of participation is needed  while keeping the discussion focused   Include a slide in your presentation that clearly communicates what type of feedback you are and are not looking for in the meeting  Using a presentation template that includes an outline slide lets everyone know what will be covered and in what order  This adds structure to the meeting and ensures you don t forget to review the items above during the meeting   Tell a story  When you re presenting  tell the story about how your design came to be  Walk through each section of the design and explain your rationale  Talk about the design  its benefits  and how it solves the project goals  but avoid explaining what they can obviously see right in front of them    For example  if the color palette you chose was inspired by a mural you saw on a walk last weekend  and you felt it perfectly addressed the mood and tone the client requested  mention it many clients who aren t familiar with the design process find this insight fascinating  and it gives them confidence that they ve hired a creative and thoughtful designer  It s also helpful to show a few slides describing some of your rationale  such as mood boards  user test results  etc   before showing the actual design   If you re presenting multiple options  name each concept and show a recap slide with all of the options on one page  This makes it easier for discussion at the end of the review   Present your most straightforward  on message  design first  This gives reviewers confidence that you understand the project and its objectives  Once this is established  they ll be more receptive to ideas you present later that may be more conceptual   Control the pace  Ask the client to hold feedback until the end of your presentation  once you ve walked them through the design  Take your time to present  and don t rush  Be mindful and read the room if you see someone checking the time or reading emails on their phone  it s time to speed things up  If the client has seen something before or agrees with your design recommendation  it s probably safe to go quickly through those sections   Always keep an eye on the time if the discussion gets off track or the meeting is scheduled to end soon  look for an opportunity to politely remind meeting attendees of the goals for the meeting  and offer to schedule a follow up meeting to discuss the remaining topics if needed   Guide feedback  At the beginning of the meeting  explain to the client the type of feedback you are and are not looking for  As an example  if you re showing wireframes  the client may not understand that you aren t looking for feedback on visual design details at this stage  so clarify that for them up front   Push back on client feedback you disagree with  You ve been hired because you re an expert at what you do  so it s your job to give honest recommendations as a designer  It s natural that the client may disagree with some of your suggestions  but never get defensive  Hear the client out and be thoughtful of their feelings and feedback  They often bring valuable insights and ideas that can make the final design stronger   If the client chooses to continually ignore your advice  it s a business gamble on their part  To protect your integrity and sanity  your best option might be to do all you can within their constraints  leave the project out of your portfolio  and move on   Most importantly  be confident  The absolute most important thing to remember when presenting design work  show enthusiasm and confidence  If you re confident in your work  your client will be too,"[280 387 434 271 166 867 604 1094 145

305,training-dataset/business/930.txt,business,Why your Project is Doomed to Fail18 Flares 18 Flares    David Kullman talks to ProductTank NYC about why most projects are doomed to fail right from the very start  David is a Partner and Development Manager at CitrusByte  working with both large corporations and startups to develop innovative software solutions to challenges they may be facing   IT Project Failures   The Statistics  In 1995  IT spending amounted to around 250 billion dollars in the US alone  In 2015  the worldwide spending in IT was 3 4 trillion dollars  If the majority of projects succeeded  that money would have been well spent  Unfortunately  that is not the case   Only about 29 percent of projects ever succeed  Of the remaining  52 percent are heavily challenged  and 19 percent are cancelled all together  What that means is of the 3 4 trillion dollars that was spent worldwide in 2015  about 2 4 trillion dollars was wasted on challenged or failed projects   David goes on to explain that on average  successful IT projects are 222 percent late and 189 percent over budget  Plus  once they are finished  most projects only see about 61 percent of their original scope being completed  Projects are taking twice as long and costing twice as much to only meet half of the original goal   Why your project is doomed to fail  The process of starting a new project can shed some light on this  When the idea for a new project is hatched  people can be excited  Past failures seem distant because this new project seems different  They look for new methods that they ve heard of and have been successful  Long term concerns can develop early on  but action isn t taken due to short term focus  After the first few months  dates start to slip and expectations aren t met  People start to realize that deadlines won t be met and quality is missing  As they realize that it s too late to fix things in the original timeframe  panic sets in  Eventually  the project fails despite new and improved methods and technology  To back this up  a study by IBM showed that 54 percent of projects fail because of project management  while only 3 percent fail due to technical issues   The Size of the Project  The size of the project is partially to blame for failures  A study conducted by CHAOS Report showed that the larger a project is  the more likely it is to fail  This is mostly because smaller projects have less people involved  which means a tighter system of communication  easier access to resources  and less barriers  Brooks  Law can support this  stating that  adding manpower to a late software project makes it later    Lack of Planning  Size is not the only contributing factor to projects failing  Another major cause is a lack of planning  Either the team doesn t have the expertise or experience needed to plan properly  or planning is cut short to save time and resources  Often  this leads to a month to month outline  where each month is focussed on a certain iteration of the project   Insufficient Resources  Frequently  developers will assume that the least expensive approach is always the best one  This often leads to cutting corners on their best practices  which then leads to severe shortcomings  Worst of all  there is often a delayed impact  meaning those shortcomings aren t apparent until it is too late   David states that investing in the right team for a project  or choosing the project based on the team s expertise and experience  can go a long way in terms of the project succeeding   People Management  People tend to be much better at coming up with ideas than sticking to plans  Because of this  it can be difficult for team members understand how and why plans change and certain ideas are dropped  David explains that there needs to be a vetting process in place for agreeing on an idea  and sticking to the plan  That way even though people may not like the idea  they can still understand and believe in the process and be fully vested in the project   Takeaways  David explains that the point to his presentation was not to simply teach how to make your project succeed  but rather  how to setup your project to best avoid failure  In short  his three major pieces of advice are to plan large projects just as you would smaller ones  invest wisely as opposed to minimally  and use a cadence based planning model with economic prioritization,"[305 510 67 717 543 387 1240 1291 573 271 867]"
341,training-dataset/product/422.txt,product,What s Your UX Combo We re developing a feature that adds a new layer of customization that I m not supposed to tell you about  So  let s keep this between us   We have a pressing deadline and huge aspirations   Shipping a minimum viable product in client centered B2B SaaS environment still means shipping a quality product   and quality requires thorough user testing and making use of the feedback we receive  The more iterative the process  the better   For this new feature  I have a short time to market  but in my favor  I happen to have access to users who sit across the hall from me  Knowing these factors  I can find a UX Combo that fits these specific constraints and gives me the maximum UX ROI   What is a UX Combo   A UX Combo is a set of UX methods selected for a given project  which can provide the best ROI for UX research  design and testing   Within the given resource constraints  namely access to users and time to market  UX Combos are a holistic approach to look at your UX efforts   If you re thinking you missed the lecture on UX Combos  don t worry  This is an idea that was developed by myself and the WalkMe team and is only now being shared with the public   As the UX Lead at WalkMe  part of my job is to help product managers understand and get the most out of their options and resources   I wanted an easy way to communicate to product managers that they have multiple options to choose from and that the diversity of methods gives them the flexibility to optimize their usage for each project s specific constraints   Choosing your UX methods at the beginning of the project is a critical part of the UX Combo approach  If you don t plan ahead of time  you may as well not use the UX Combo approach   Why  Deciding at the beginning of the project which UX methods you will pursue  will allow enough time to conduct each of the user experience methods properly  The main issues being   Getting users for sessions requires planning ahead  WRT the feedback you get  you need time to digest  analyze  re design  and build  and sometimes test again    If you plan in advance you can make sure users are involved in the optimal way  again  ROI   With this approach  at the beginning of each project we now ask  What s your UX Combo   and have an instant and deep understanding of how we choose which UX methods are right for the project   UX Methods are Grouped into 3 Stages on the Product Development Timeline  The first step for our team was to understand the relationship between the product timeline and the available qualitative user experience methods   I m mainly referring to the qualitative UX methods  since analyzing current user behavior data is less time sensitive and  sometimes  less relevant when you re designing a new feature   I ve sketched out a general product timeline in Figure 1   This timeline brings UX designers and product managers on the same page by placing the main qualitative methods that we can pursue on top of the timeline at which point they become relevant   The methods are broken to two types  Those that involve users and those who don t  The reason for this breakdown is to highlight the effort required to access users  and that your selection is very much dependent on that   In high level  the UX methods are broken to three stages within the product UX timeline   Requirements   Collecting requirements via stakeholders  users  competitors  etc  Design   UX Concepts and later on Wireframes Testing   Prototype testing  and usability testing  pre and post release   Ideally  you would want to have at least one UX method incorporated from each of the three stages  This begins the feedback loop early which makes it possible for your final product to be in line with user needs from the beginning  and gives you additional opportunities to iterate and refine later on   What you don t want to do is have all feedback gathered in one stage  If you wait till the end  you are likely to have more to fix than if you had relevant input in the beginning  Having feedback only in the middle or beginning means you won t have information on your final product   UX Efforts are Constrained by Access to Users   Time to Market  The next step for our team was to ask which UX methods we should use  and even more importantly  which ones we can skip   There are a lot of factors that can affect which methods you select such as your own confidence in facilitating the method  or to what extent your organization is risk averse   However  at the end of the day we believe that the two factors that affect your decision most are  access to users and time to market   B2B companies may find that it is exceedingly difficult to access users  You may want to run some in context Requirements Capture  i e  meeting users in their own work environment   but cannot afford flying there every time   Or you may want to run both Concept Testing  early  and Usability Testing  post launch  but the Account Managers may limit your access to their clients for business reasons   Understanding that these two limitations will determine which UX methods are feasible within the planned product timeline  we then can quickly narrow down our options   In Figure 2  you can see a matrix of suggested methods you can apply under your specific set of circumstances   These are based on our own experience  and are suggestions only  You can obviously pick and choose as best fits your resources   Now that we know which options are available  we can put them on the timeline   A UX Combo is a Mix of Methods  Represented on the Timeline  Let s see how this matrix lays out on the timeline and why   High Access to Users  Short Time to Market  In Figure 3  we re looking at  High Access to Users  Short Time to Market  which  generally speaking  is the most frequent case here at WalkMe   Fortunately  we have some of our heavy users internally  Our Professional Services team is only a couple of rooms away from us  meaning High Access  but we re on a tight timeline to release   In this case  I can squeeze in fairly easily the Requirement Capture AND Prototype Testing so I have two stages of user input  Based on these and if time presses  I should feel fairly comfortable to release the product and only test it after its launch  to minimize Time to Market   High Access to Users  Long Time to Market  Alternatively  if I m lucky enough to have more time I can spend more of it in the early stages  get a strong basis for my assumptions  and still run Usability Testing before launch  This is shown in Figure 4   A different variation of the same approach can be achieved by replacing Concept Design and Concept Testing  with one of my favorites   Participatory Design   Assuming you re seasoned facilitator  the later involves a design workshop with the users so if users are happy with the outcome  you can skip the Concept Testing and move on towards build   Low Access to Users  Long Time to Market  If getting access to users is harder but time wise you re comfortable  then you need to be frugal with your users   In this scenario  shown in Figure 5  work independently with non user methods and involve the users only twice  to confirm assumptions via Concept Testing and to test the real thing before it s out   Low Access to Users  Short Time to Market  For the worst case scenario when you re limited both with users and time  interview stakeholders  come up with concepts and test them with users  As you near launch  grab a colleague or a peer UX pro  hey  always good to have some UX friends  to run an Expert Evaluation   Release the product and then run some Usability Testing  post launch  as seen in Figure 6   So what are you waiting for  Perfect your UX now with WalkMe s help   What do you think   In the nature of UX  I want to know what my  users  think  Is your team able to find value in the UX Combo s approach   Be sure to check back in the coming weeks and months  The SpecTECHular team will be doing full explanations of each method  more on each UX Combo  and more,"[341 75 1322 188 1259

347,training-dataset/product/780.txt,product,Hands on prototyping  a walk through guide37 Flares 37 Flares    As a product manager I m sure you will have found that prototypes can be hugely useful for visualising requirements and revealing hidden risks   Lengthy  50 page requirements are not reliable ways of conveying all the subtleties of a digital product  In my experience  readers quickly get bored and even worse  misinterpret what is written   But prototypes expand each user story into a tangible part of a system  in my experience  If user stories express task level goals  then prototypes can help us see the horizontal feature set  breadth  and vertical feature set  depth  required to fulfil each story   I ve found the following methodology very useful in my work as a product manager   Prioritise your user stories for prototyping  Start prototyping the user stories  Annotate prototypes to get the right feedback  This is my approach to whittling down a list of requirements into a clear product vision  which I hope others will find useful   List all your user stories  Let s say you re building a mobile app that allows users to print their phone pictures in a photo book  Below are some of the primary user stories for this type of app   As a user I can create a new account  As a user I can select pictures from my phone gallery  As a user I can select my photo book size  As a user I can apply visual effects to my pictures  As a user I can pay for my book with a credit card  As a user I can access my order history  As a user I can access the Terms   Conditions and Privacy Policy  You don t need to worry about the fine details of each user story  You simply want to list the user actions so that you can map out the user flow and identify any gaps   Prioritise user stories by risk  I ve found that there s little benefit from prototyping a user story like this one below   As a user I can access the Terms   Conditions and Privacy Policy  It s a low risk user story because the screens involved are static and read only   For prototyping  I always prioritise user stories involving user submitted data and processing of user submitted data because this is where the most risk often lies and a clear user experience is most required   Let s examine the potential risks of each user story for the photo book example   ID User Story Comments Risk Level 1  As a user I can create a new account Accounts are necessary to keep each user s data separate and private High 2  As a user I can select pictures from my phone gallery Since this is a mobile app  it s essential that users can connect to and access the phone s image gallery High 3  As a user I can select my photo book size The book size selected on this screen should be the same book size used at the printer  There s a chance that book size codes could get mixed up  resulting in the customer receiving the wrong size Medium 4  As a user I can pay for my book with a credit card Users will be inputting personal and banking information  We need to decide if the info is stored for future use  If so  then technical implementation will need to address security and data encryption needs  High 5  As a user I can access my order history This is a read only screen  Only potential risk is errors related to order cost or book type  Medium 6  As a user I can access the Terms   Conditions and Privacy Policy for the app No user data is being received or manipulated in these screens  Read only content  Low  Prototype the riskiest user stories  Once you ve identified the high risk user stories  you can visualise them through your prototype   When prototyping requirements  I use low or medium fidelity because I want designers and developers to better understand how the specs might manifest themselves as interaction models and content structures  There s no point getting ahead of yourself by prescribing branding and visual design   Let s take a look at the prototypes for user stories 1  2  3 and 4  I ve chosen demonstrate this with UXPin since it s the tool I ve used most often as a product manager  but my advice applies to whatever tool you prefer   User Story 1  As a user I can create a new account  The first screen for the Photo Book App highlights the information that users must provide in order to create an account  This is a simple but critical screen for the technical team because it immediately clarifies the type of data stored in the back end   Name  will contain only letters   Email  will contain letters and numbers   Password  may contain letters and numbers  depending on the organisation s security rules   Based on the above requirements  stakeholders will likely ask about the rules for passwords  For example  should they contain only letters  letters and numbers  letters and special characters   By presenting a prototype  you can discuss the best rules for secure passwords  Without a prototype  developers wouldn t know the type of information stored and visual designers wouldn t have any guidelines about the quantity of displayed information   User Story 2  As a user I can select pictures from my phone gallery  The prototype for User Story 2 involves two screens that must appear in a particular order   User presses the camera icon in the first screen  The second screen displays all the images stored in the user s phone  In addition  the prototype showcases another important aspect of the user experience  ensuring users can easily see the their selected images  In the prototype  this functional need is represented by the checkboxes placed in the top  right corner of each image   It s important to note that the app must provide feedback to users about selected images  While the prototype uses a checkbox  the visual designer may choose another option that works better for the screen size  brand  and overall user flow  For example  a transparent overlay could be placed over each selected image  or the colour of each image border could change to indicate that it is selected  Using a prototype you can now quickly discuss and refine these items   The technical team also benefits from this prototype because they can now see the rough number of images that need to be instantly uploaded from local storage into the app   User Story 3  As a user I can select my photo book size  We prototyped User Story 3  even though it s a Medium Risk story  Whilst I think you should always prioritise High Risk stories when prototyping  there are cases where it makes sense to prototype a Medium or Low Risk screen   For our Photo Book App  once users select their photos  the above screen for User Story 2 acts as the transition point towards checkout  We can t avoid any mis steps in such a key moment when users are selecting the product   While it s nowhere near perfect  we ve at least created a tangible reference for designers  developers  and marketers  The team can now discuss   How might book dimensions  price and short descriptions accompany images of the photo books   How might we help users preview their selected images in the final photo book size   Should the book print the photos in the book in the order they were uploaded  Or do we allow users to reorder the pages   Do we include an additional step that allows users to select a cover image  Or do we randomly assign one from the images they uploaded   User Story 4  As a user I can pay for my book with a credit card  The prototype for User Story 4 showcases the basic payment information we need to collect  This allows everyone to discuss the rules for each field  For example   How many numbers can the user enter in the credit card field  Do we accept all card types  Visa  Mastercard  American Express   American Express cards have 15 numbers while Visa and Mastercard have 16 numbers  We must account for these variances   Should we consider adding PayPal as a payment option  If so  how do we prioritise that integration for developers in upcoming sprints   When fields are left empty or invalid data is submitted  how does the system respond   This prototype also highlights a very important functional requirement  saving the user s payment information for future use   While this is just one little checkbox in the UI  the technical implications are quite serious  We ll need to research legal requirements for storing personal information  In addition  the technical team must consider what might happen if servers suffer an attack or virus  Would customer data become publicly available   At each step of your prototyping exercise  I think it s important to focus on creating screens that clearly communicate the desired functionality and actions  By using built in components like buttons  icons  image placeholders and phone frames  you can create a user friendly prototype that will help everyone visualise the final product and associated risks   Once you re done building all the screens  you can add interactions to all the key content   Calls to action leading to new screens  Icons and images that expand or open new screens  Form fields that react to user input  Next  you can annotate and share the interactive prototype for feedback   4  Add comments and questions to your prototype  As you build prototypes  you ll likely have open questions for developers  designers  or management stakeholders   Usually  I ve found it helps to annotate   Regional restrictions  For example  prices in the US use a period     to separate the whole number and decimal portions  For example   25 00  However  in the Euro zone it s common to use a comma     instead  For example   25 00  I would annotate these types of nuances so that it s clear to the technical team that this is non negotiable   Nice to have functionality  If some requirements can be added on in a subsequent version  point this out in your prototype  In the Photo Book App  the option to save the user s payment information isn t a must have for the initial release  It s a convenience that can be added later once you ve released the product  You ll need more time to work on implementing the correct data encryption and security to support that functionality   Items that might be costly  If you re worried about a particularly functionality being too costly to implement  then immediately highlight your concern in the prototype  Use the prototype as an opportunity to discuss the effort needed to implement the items that you find most worrisome  Then  you can adapt your final requirements based on the feedback you receive   5  Share the prototype for consolidated feedback  When it comes to reviewing feedback  you can set up a group meeting with all stakeholders and present the screens   I think however that a better option is to provide some lead time during which all stakeholders can review the screens in your absence   Sharing a link to your prototype provides the following benefits   Stakeholders can interact and evaluate the prototypes without feeling rushed  The feedback is less knee jerk   Stakeholders can evaluate the prototypes with minimal bias  In a group meeting  the PM will usually set the context for the screens  However  outside of the confines of a meeting  the screens must speak for themselves  If the basic functionality is not clear as presented on the prototype  this quickly becomes evident to the stakeholders   When you share the link to a prototype  stakeholders can review all the comments and questions  Stakeholders can hover over any pin to view its details as shown below  For example  user story 4  which deals with storing payment information  You can leave questions regarding the legal and technical requirements for this functionality   For a more complex project  it s a good idea to review feedback in a group setting  This is an opportunity to focus on the feedback that requires buy in from other stakeholders   Here are a few of my tips for actionable feedback   When you send your team the design  ask for feedback regarding these items  product vision  feature completeness  and flow between pages  Explain that they shouldn t obsess over the UI design since that may change completely later   When responding to comments  ask why  I ve found it helps if you can the question in useful and non condescending ways  Try something like   That s an interesting perspective  Have you seen any data that brought you to that conclusion or is it more of a gut instinct   If someone says it s a gut instinct  reframe their situation from a user s perspective   While that makes sense  as a user  if I wanted to accomplish  user story   I d most likely need  actions  to happen because of  user and market research     Tease out the core problem behind the feedback with the 3 question rule   6  Analyse feedback  update prototypes and user stories  After you ve analysed all your feedback  update the prototype and user stories   For our Photo Book App example  the review process brought up an important question that we missed in the original user stories  the need to send confirmation emails when an order is placed and after it s shipped   For any ecommerce platform  transactional emails are essential for reassuring customers that their order is on its way  Without this  the user experience for the Photo Book App is seriously degraded  Therefore  we need to update our user stories   As a user I will receive an email when I submit my order   As a user I will receive an email when my order has been shipped   In this case  a prototype of the email is also warranted to ensure we account for all legal requirements for receipts and invoices  Failure to respect legal requirements for receipts can lead to serious consequences for the business down the road  We would therefore consider this new user story as High Risk   Overall  the Photo Book App example we explored is fairly simple  But you can imagine how the more complex your product  the more user stories you might otherwise miss unless you prototype   Each time you update the prototype  reshare it with stakeholders to validate the changes are satisfactory  After the first revision  designers and developers should see enough of your vision to create the first formal build to test with users   And as we all know  the earlier we revise and validate the vision  the less costs and risk we accumulate   Conclusion  Prototypes should always be part of the specification process  In my past projects  they ve made it much easier to notice gaps and redundancies in the user flow  Furthermore  prototypes are a great time saver for product teams  You no longer need to rely on lengthy specifications documents to get your point across  You can build a quick prototype  annotate it  and share it with your team members to get feedback   As part of an agile process  prototyping helps everyone unpack and prioritise requirements before each sprint  A prototype opens everyone s eyes  The laundry list dissolves  and the product comes into focus  The consequences of additional features become immediately real for everyone from a junior designer to a product VP,"[347 188 1322 461 145 891 1388

355,training-dataset/product/877.txt,product,The step by step guide to an effective UX auditThis step by step guide will teach you how to audit your user experience  But before we dive in  let s first understand   What are the benefits of a UX audit   If you know there s pain or friction in your user experience  a review of your current UX can help create a short term roadmap  Through a UX audit you ll discover why conversions are low  how to enhance onboarding  why retention may be low  or any other issue you re currently experiencing  The ROI of user experience is clear  so auditing to find out where you re deficient will pay dividends   All of this results in empathy with your customer  You ll have a more clear understanding of who is using your product  so there will be a fundamental shift in what you know about the people using your product once it s all said and done   After this audit you ll be able to definitively say  We found this opportunity for improvement  so let s use those learnings when we redesign    Who should perform a UX audit   Most people can definitely benefit from a UX audit  but we wanted to identify those who benefit the most from completing a UX assessment  Generally  we ve found that anyone without a UX team in place benefits from this type of assessment  Always keep your users in mind even if you don t have a dedicated UX team   We ve found that companies who already have a product that they want to grow will greatly benefit from a UX audit  as it helps them realize the friction points that users are currently experiencing  thus addressing those problems head on and removing barriers leading to a goal  This is especially true for startups with investors as the pressure is on to grow  We ve also seen success with startups with new products that are ready to launch but want a gut check to ensure that the MVP process is seamless and focused on the user   The do s and don ts of conducting a UX audit  Before we get into the actual audit process  let s first go over what you should and should not do when conducting an audit of your user experience   Don t assume you know what users are thinking  Do try to give yourself the directive motivations of your users  Understand your personas and try to embody them throughout your audit  Do conduct usability testing by recording your users  screens  This will help you see what their actual experience was after the fact  As a bonus  it s easy to grab screenshots from there as well so you don t have to keep creating new user accounts   Don t conduct the usability test yourself  It s practically impossible for you to have a raw experience since you re so familiar with your product  However  if you must conduct it yourself   Don t be biased  When conducting the audit  act like a typical user  not your ideal super user who goes straight to the goal  Click around a bit  immerse yourself in the experience  Also  be sure to record your own screen   Do keep to a timeline  It s easy to get carried away and commit too much time  or to not set aside enough time  By setting timeline goals you will find the happy medium  Do a content audit  This can help uncover inconsistencies and duplications  Do conduct contextual testing  This helps you experience connections speeds firsthand to mimic what users experience  If your product is a web and native mobile app  do make sure there s a consistent UX through your product s eco system  Before you start  Make sure you have everything you need in order to conduct a UX audit  Typically  we make sure that we have the following   An understanding of your current and target users   What are your current users  goals  Where are they coming from  What is their intended action  What s the bigger picture that this experience fits into  If you re not sure about these questions then you may want to go back and research so that you have an understanding of who your users are and the goal that you want them to complete   You also have to consider whether your current users are your actual target audience  If not  why is that  Do you have a clearly defined target audience  You should also have a clear idea of whether or not your current users are the users that you want to be coming in  Additionally  you should also anticipate additional users coming in that may not be on either of these lists  Regardless of where you are with current and target audience  you should always know what you want your outcome to be   Clearly defined goals   As with any project  you need to make sure you have a baseline and goals  If you don t know your end goal  how do you know what was successful  You definitely need to have a main objective for conducting this audit and what you want out of this  Some other important goals to have are revenue goals  conversion goals  and anything else that s important to your business   Who should be involved   In most UX audits  you d want to involve strategists  designers  and developers  Awesome stuff happens when you get multiple departments in the same room  You also want to make sure that you have a decision maker involved  Walk the decision maker down the path to let them see friction points at all levels and validate ideas  You don t want your colleagues proposing ideas without first understanding the full experience   One good tactic to ensure that everyone is heard is to implement internal anonymous UX surveys to discover known pain points   Resources available   Make sure you know who will be conducting the audit  Are they available  Do they know how much time is required of them  Make sure you ve set expectations before beginning the process  Once you know who to invovle  be sure that everyone understands expectations and has the time to commit  Avoid bottlenecks due to availability or lack of planning   Timeline   Set a due date and make sure you have a well constructed timeline to keep everything on track  It s also helpful to have an overall timeline with milestones set for specific dates as well as individual timelines containing tasks and clear ownership   Budgets   Do you have a budget set aside for this  This is especially important if you seek a third party to conduct the audit  The expected cost for this type of project will depend on how in depth you want to go  You can get a 2 day audit from a freelancer for roughly  1 500  with the output being a short design checklist that you can tick off as you go  For around  7 500 you can hire a professional UX consultant who will give you a checklist of even deeper insights and it ll take about a week   If you want something that s custom created and aligned with your goals and much more actionable from a team of UX professionals  you re looking to pay around  9 000  10 000 with the deliverables being extremely actionable insights pointing to the problems that you should address  prioritized based on your goals  These typically take 2 weeks to a month   When conducting the UX audit  Make sure you get a real experience of what the user would do on your site  leading them to a certain behavior  Don t forget to record your screen  It may be difficult to get an objective experience of your own site since you designed it  so try to get an outside opinion  You must also keep the full experience in mind  A user won t just appear on your site looking to convert imagine where they came from and what they might want or expect from your company  Play to that mindset   Recommended tools  Kissmetrics helps you track  analyze  and optimize your digital marketing performance  We really like it because it takes the entire user journey into account not just their web behavior by tracking across both web and mobile behavior   Quicktime  We use this to record ourselves going through the user experience so that we get a video of the experience we actually had in real time  It also makes it a lot simpler to grab screenshots of each step rather than continuously creating user accounts   Good tools for beginners  Hotjar is another heatmapping tool we like  Since there s no customization involved  it s ready out of the box so you can begin using it right away   Mixpanel is best for analytics around mobile apps  It captures specific behaviors that you set  like clicking  tapping on the comments section  etc   These are all tools that you can use to identify the common visitor flows towards a goal  whether it s signup  purchase  etc  The insights gleaned from these tools will tell you which parts of the user journey to prioritize  We recommend screenshotting each step in each of these flows and annotate that way   When do you know you re  done    These types of audits are never really complete since a user experience is a moving target  so how do you know when you ve actually finished your audit   Our best advice is to set a time limit for yourself  otherwise you can end up going down the rabbit hole and taking too long to make any real impact  Generally within 2 3 weeks of dedicated auditing  you ll find 80  of what you need to get going   Is it better for internal folks to do a UX audit  or should you hire a third party   As with all UX questions  our answer is  It depends   If you need speed  it s best to hire a third party  UX audits are extremely time consuming  and many companies simply don t have the bandwidth  Additionally  third parties are more objective  and not emotionally invested  They will truly be able to look at your product with  new eyes    There are also positives for doing this internally  Your team has a better more in depth background on your product or service  and it generally costs less  And take into account opportunity cost if you do it yourself  How much is your time worth  Also  while you have good insight into your own brand product  it could give you a blindspot  Lastly  keep in mind that if you ve never done a UX audit before  there s definitely a learning curve so it ll take longer and require a great deal of learning   Now what   Decide on an action plan  If you try this yourself  we d love to hear about your progress   Alternatively  we at Digital Telepathy recently launched Compass  a service that can run a full UX assessment for you in 2 weeks and provide you with an actionable roadmap and insights that will address your biggest challenges

387,training-dataset/product/1264.txt,product,Designing case studies that attract more clientsWhether you re looking for a studio job or you want to get some new freelance clients  you need a good portfolio  I m talking more than just a series of curated images with a short description of the project  I know you can do better than that   You should be creating in depth case studies around your work and they should document your process and market your services on your website  This is much better than just having a gallery as your portfolio for several very important reasons   It can serve as the final presentation of your project when it comes time to send off your final work to the client More content on the page means your portfolio piece ranks higher in search results By showcasing your process  you re giving clients a better idea of how you work  which lays down their expectations for future projects It gives you the opportunity to prove your worth and show that you can satisfy your customers  needs It can help lead the user to contact you for a new project with a tailored call to action  In this article  I ll go over the key elements that make a good case study and the steps you need to take to get more clients from your design portfolio   Document your process  The easiest way to create your case study  document your process along the way  This includes taking screenshots and photographs of your process while keeping detailed notes that explain your design decisions   So at every stage of the project when you make an internal revision  document it and explain why you made it  By explaining your process in this way  you re able to keep yourself in check to ensure that you re making the right decisions based on your client s goals and not your personal aesthetic or gut feeling   To keep your notes and images organized you can use Behance s WIP  Work In Progress  feature that allows you to show your work in its early stages  and get feedback on it from your followers that can help guide the artistic direction   This has been especially helpful for me because it simplifies the process of putting my ideas together while making connections with other creative professionals online  Check out the example above where you can see my process of creating my 26 Letters piece for my new homepage   Your case study doubles as your final presentation  Another added benefit to creating case studies is that they also serve as an excellent final presentation to give to your client once production is complete  For me  this always wows my clients because it proves that my project perfectly aligns with their expectations and goals  And that makes it really hard for them to ask for revisions later on   Then  once the client approves my artwork and pays the final installment  I can easily reuse my presentation to post a detailed case study in my portfolio  Double win   Here s a sample of a recent logo design case study I created for Paper Tiger Mentoring that showcases the steps I took to complete the design  Notice how much more engaging this is and how my revisions have reasons behind them  It s hard to argue with a final result when everything you made reflects what s most appropriate to attract my client s demographic   So rather than just sending your client the final static image of your project  why not create a case study that serves as the final presentation instead  Think of how much better of an impression it would make to send your client the beautiful final result in addition to showing the steps you took to get there   The 6 key principles to the perfect case study  Now that you understand the importance of case studies  let s break down the key elements that will get your portfolio noticed and keep the project inquiries rolling in   Try framing your first case study from an educational perspective  This means having a dedicated page on your website that helps others understand your creative process  This is not an easy task at first because you probably won t have much experience writing about your work  but with practice it gets a lot easier and really fun   1  Provide a meaningful overview for the non readers  The project overview is the first piece of content on the page that allows your visitors to get some additional information about the project and understand what was accomplished  Keep this short and to the point so that the skimmers and browsers can get a quick look at what your project is all about without having to read the full case study   Here s an example of how I introduced my hand lettered logo design project for Say Something Marketing  Notice that I provide some key information before I start to talk about my process like industry  creation date  project duties  and objective  You can either break down the info like how I have here  or provide just a few lines for your overview  Just be sure to include the problems that your client is trying to solve so that you can talk about your process with their goals in mind   Along with this introduction  it s important to show the final result upfront before going into the beginning stages of your process  You don t want to make the user scroll down to the bottom of the page in order to see the final result of your beautiful work   2  Show pictures lots and lots of pictures  Your images should tell the complete story of how you got from your initial research all the way to your final product  This means taking screenshots  uploading high quality pictures of sketches  creating mockups  and anything else that can help visualize your story  Give your users some eye candy and seduce them to read your content   People love seeing the evolution of a project and how it came to life  Watching a project form step by step is not only engaging  it also makes you more relatable when you show the mistakes you made along the way   So don t worry if one of your process shots isn t perfect or camera ready  It s a work in progress it s not supposed to be perfect on the first try  Check out my process for creating my Stop Staring Poster  It has imperfections  but that s what makes the final result so much more interesting   3  Describe the reason behind your decisions  Every color  line  and letter you use in your designs should have a purpose and reason it works best for your client  The purpose of the case study is to put the design project into context and to show how it works in a real world situation  as opposed to showing only how the final product looks   This is why you have an in depth onboarding process before starting production so you can get a detailed and clear view of what your client wants  In order to land your ideal clients  you need a questionnaire that sets the tone of the project moving forward and gives you everything you need to determine if it s the right project for you  This way you can over deliver on a project because it s custom made to attract their audience   4  Top it off with a client testimonial  Client testimonials are proof that you can provide work that satisfies your customers  A good testimonial creates trust and has the power to convince even your  tough sell  visitors that your service can make a difference in your customer s life  So it s important to not only follow up with your clients to get a review of your services but know how to use your testimonials effectively on your website   Most of us ask for testimonials  and if we follow up and pester our customers enough  we get testimonials  But without asking the right questions to probe our clients  our testimonials usually end up looking something like this   Dina did a great job on this project  I m very happy and plan to work with her again   Now that isn t a bad review  but it doesn t sell my services or tell a good story of how I am to work with  This is because most clients don t know how to give testimonials  so as professionals we need to guide them to provide testimonials that will inspire potential clients to hire us   Here are the 3 basic questions you should ask in order to get a powerful testimonial   Discuss your experience working with me  What did you like most about your final project  Would you hire me again  If so  why   By asking these questions  I m able to get a testimonial that tells a vivid story  Check out one of my previous client testimonials for a logo design project I created forBrandScape   Dina invested hours learning about my brand personality  mission  and style  She was completely transparent about her process and always kept me involved  It was up to Dina to really translate everything we d discussed to a logo  and the end result blew me away   The script is playful but clean  and the colors pop beautifully  The logo is visually distinct and professional  and I m excited to display it every chance I get  I m so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with Dina for such a unique product  and I plan to work with her again   Now that s a testimonial that sells  About 3 days after posting this project and testimonial  I received 5 new inquiries  And they just keep rolling on in all from one excellent case study   5  Don t forget the call to action  Just like any other page on your site  you need a call to action  CTA  to help guide the user to contact you  For me  82  of the people who look at 3 or more of my projects in my portfolio submit a project request  So having a CTA on your portfolio page is one of the most important pieces of content that will help you get new clients   If you ve followed the above steps in your case study  you should have enticed your user enough to contact you  Now all you need is to serve up a custom pitch of your services on the bottom of the page with a link to your questionnaire   There are several ways to make your call to actions stand out  but with each project you should have a custom written call to action that speaks directly to your user  For example  if a client is looking at my portfolio and is checking out one of my hand lettered logo designs  they re most likely interested in hiring me for a similar project   Rather than having a nonspecific CTA such as  Like what you see  Contact me today for a free quote   try presenting a more personalized message like  Interested in a hand lettered logo design that s custom made to attract your audience  Contact me today for a free quote    See the difference  If you were a potential client looking for a logo design  which one would you click on   6  SEO is important  too  SEO is an often overlooked step when adding new projects to your portfolio  It s a necessary part of web design that can help you get more organic traffic to your portfolio site   Your portfolio is filled with work that other clients in those industries want  So a good starting point is to use descriptive long tail keywords like  logo design for app  or  web design for restaurants   You already have the content and images to reel them in  and now all you need are some keywords to get their attention on Google   You can test out search terms by using tools such as Wordtracker and the Google Adwords Keyword Tool  I won t go into the nuts and bolts of search engine optimization here   For a crash course in SEO that won t overwhelm you  check out this article   Blast your newest project across the internet  After you ve posted your case study online  the work is only about 90  complete  That extra 10  is going to get new eyes on your portfolio and help you get your work noticed  This means posting your work everywhere your designs are welcomed   So get active on Facebook  Twitter  and Google   post your portfolio pieces to Behance  Dribbble  and deviantART  Get creative and film your process and put the video on YouTube or livestream it using Periscope  You could even create a slideshow of your artwork and share it on Slideshare or put together a PDF presentation and upload it to Scribd  The more you link out your newest portfolio piece  the more people you can get looking at your work   The great thing about marketing yourself isn t just getting more clients it s building a following of other like minded designers  Tons of designers and art directors are always on the lookout for people to pass design work onto  Once you start forming a good network  you ll find that more projects will automatically start coming to you  rather than you frantically searching and begging for work   This was originally published on Letter

401,training-dataset/product/51.txt,product,Designers share how they get focusedMaybe you have a list of effective rituals to help you double down on your workload  Or  if you re anything like me  you re looking for some new ideas to help regain your focus throughout the day   We asked the InVision community to share tips for when they re having trouble getting  in the zone  and we got some seriously good answers  Here s what they had to say    Our office is on a bike trail  so I ll go on a walk with a coworker who isn t on the project to run the problem by them  Fresh air goes well with a fresh perspective  I come back with a head full of ideas and a couple thousand steps on my Fitbit     Jon Moore  Senior Design Partner at Innovatemap   For me  about it s understanding that concentration and focus are resources you can improve  A concentration master might have 4 hours  worth of focus in a day  while a novice might only have one hour  What helps me get in the zone is knowing that every time I m going deep into a task or project  I m training my concentration skills to be better in the long run  That means I need to be mindful and identify when I m distracted and how to eliminate distractions but knowing there s a reward a little later down the line makes it all worth it     Cassius Kiani  Partner at Mikleo   I leave my workspace to take a walk  get a cup of coffee  or whatever will get me away from staring at my screen  Often I run into something that gives me a source of inspiration or insight into something I hadn t thought of  Then I go back  jam to my newest pump up song  and get down to work  Some of my best work comes from that process     Meghan Lojeski  Graphic Designer at Bright Cellars   Usually when I m having trouble getting in the zone at work  it s because my mind is racing with ideas and I can t focus on the task  I have to write down those thoughts so I can forget them and move on  Another thing I like to do is take a quick break and relax in our sleep pod     Shannon Ramelot  UX Designer at Quicken Loans   I drink a couple glasses of water  and sometimes a shot of espresso   plug in my earbuds  and listen to instrumental music like Tycho or Gramatik loud enough that I can t hear the people around me chatting     Stephanie Polus  Project Manager at Ideapark   I listen to an episode of the Design Matters podcast     Kara Fellows  Creative Manager at Sanitas Skincare   I get some coffee  move to a different space  and put some headphones on     Katelyn Robertson  Front end Developer Designer at DigitalMarketer   If it s really bad  I ll make a quick cold brew or matcha latte run to a local shop to get some  human photosynthesis  and embrace the weather  Next level down is taking a one minute breather  typically a walk around the office  and getting away from my computer to refocus and realign   When I come back  I ve got a few playlists on Spotify to listen to depending on my mood with noise cancelling headphones  Once my endorphins are up and running  it s smooth sailing     Alexis Lucio  Product Designer at Sysdig   Coffee  And sometimes techno music  As a designer  I tend to absorb the emotions around me  and that translates into my design work  So I find something to set the mood to get myself started     Jamie Thom  Media and IT Specialist at The Navigators of Canada   It s hard to focus when there are too many distractions either physically on my desk  in my brain  or digitally onscreen  I find that sometimes I just need to get it all out of my system do all the commenting  tweeting  organizing  reading  and writing that I need to then put on headphones to start cranking out real work     Ching Hsieh  Product Designer at Bay Labs   I put on headphones and listen to the same song on repeat  It may seem odd  but the repetition makes me forget about time and I slowly lose myself in the process     Chris Rudloff  Senior Graphic Designer at New World Group Inc    First  I give myself a set period of procrastination time to get all the things I d normally do to distract myself from the task out of the way  Once that time is up  I book a room or find a space where I can be isolated from the rest of the office  Then I shut my phone off  make sure I have a cup of coffee  a cup of water  and all the design supplies I might need on hand  Once I go down the checklist I pick an album  currently The Party by Andy Shauf   put it on repeat  and go to town until what needs to be done is done     Ryan Neufeld  Visual Interface Designer at Index Exchange   I have a carefully curated playlist of songs I m too embarrassed to admit I like  which I put on when I m hammering out screens  But if I m struggling with where to even begin  I pull in a teammate and a whiteboard and just start talking and sketching     Christian Beck  Principal Design Partner at Innovatemap   I put my headphones on  ignore all notifications  emails  and general office chatter  and push play on the album Razia s Shadow by Forgive Durden on Spotify  There s something about it that really helps me focus  I ll also sometimes use a Pomodoro timer if I m struggling to concentrate and have a lot to do     Charli Prangley  Designer at EDITED  How do you get in the zone   Be right back Googling  how to cold brew    Have some good tips for focusing you d like to share  Share them with

434,training-dataset/product/801.txt,product,How I landed my first 5 figure UX design contractLet s get straight to it we all would like to make more as UX designers  There s a lot of advice out there about how to raise your rates and get your work noticed  but what about finding and attracting the right clients to sign a UX contract with you   Here s what I see most UX designers doing when they re seeking out higher paid work   Tinkering about updating the content of their portfolio Spending hours contemplating  Should I be a UX specialist or generalist   Wondering whether to promote their portfolio on Behance or WordPress  Those things aren t useless  but they re not as productive as the process I used to land my first big UX design contract for Net a porter com s online magazine  Let s talk about exactly what parts of the design contract process to focus on so you can book that all important first call with a potential client   When you can make that happen  you ll eclipse 95  of your competition right away  and get the UX contracts everyone wants but doesn t know how to get   Step 1  Apply to companies who ll pay you market rate or more  First  I researched and found the top ecommerce companies I wanted to work for using LinkedIn as my guide   To do this  type in the name of the companies you want to work for in the search field  then go to their company profile page and click on the yellow  Follow  button in the top right  You ll start to see posts from employees posting company news and hiring managers posting jobs from those companies   When you know how to use networking and job search tools like Linkedin to your advantage  you ll have the tools at your fingertips to build relationships  That s key to being the top of mind for jobs  especially those that may never even get to a job board   Second  I created job alerts so I d get notified when my favorite ecommerce companies were hiring   To do this  I went to LinkedIn  searched  UX Designer in London  and at the top left  and created alerts to notify me of new UX employment and contract positions advertised in my location   By focusing on finding UX roles at companies you know can pay you market rate or more  larger companies  successful or well funded startups  etc    you re more likely to reach your goals faster   Step 2  Acing the interview before the interview  Because I d taken time to follow companies and set up alerts on LinkedIn  I saw right away when the Head of UX of Net a porter com posted a message on LinkedIn saying she was looking for a UX designer   I replied immediately with a thoughtful message saying I was interested and wanted to know the next steps  We arranged a call to chat about my experience and skills  This is what I call  the interview before the interview   where your potential client wants to assess whether you re a good fit based on your skills and demeanor   Needless to say because I ended up getting the job later  this informational interview went incredibly well  Afterward  the Head of UX introduced me to HR for the formal interview process   The best way to impress a client during the initial call is to ask perceptive questions  These are the questions I asked during my interview before the interview with Net a porter com  and which you can use too     I m excited you posted a request for a UX designer  Where is your UX focus right now     Besides an increase in perceived value  what would you like the outcome of your UX design or redesign project to accomplish     I hope you don t mind me asking  what does success look like for you as far as the UX design on this project goes    All of these questions signal interest and a focus on the prospective client s goals  Be careful not to ask questions showing lack of interest in what they want  or that focus too much on yourself  Instead  ask questions that reinforce why they re looking to work with someone  and how your expertise fits their hiring needs   You can always ask questions about salary and working arrangements in the formal interview process  but this first contact should be to explore the project with the potential client   Also beware drawing attention to the size of your agency or the fact that you re a solo designer  if that s the case the company is interested in you because of your skills  so don t be afraid to go after contracts that might traditionally go to a larger company or bigger name designer   Step 3  Get a detailed UX design brief or job spec before the interview  Try to get the client to share a detailed design brief and budget with you as early as possible   The UX design brief outlines the project status  It defines business and customer needs  and it gives you an overview of what the client wants your design work to accomplish   Knowing the client s budget allows you to compare if the outcome they want is possible against your market rate and within their timeframe   But what happens if the client says   If I share the budget with you  you ll just tell me that s what it costs   To a certain extent  that s correct  And that s when you need to know the following points  in case your client has any objections to your rate   The exact market rate for your role based on research  How long it will take you to do the job  How much you need to allow for contingency  How many rounds of revisions are included  Knowing the exact market rate for your role gives you the baseline from which to negotiate and avoid getting lowballed  If the client isn t sure what the market rate should be  you should be able to show them 3 examples of what current employers are paying for the same role   Here s exactly what to look for in a design brief   The project background project status so far  The actual brief the to do list  The objectives and scope outcomes  these aren t always apparent and sometimes you have to dig deeper for these   Budget  A clear UX design brief is the foundation for a successful UX project  You want to work with clients who are disciplined in producing detailed design briefs or at defining problems  because it means they understand the UX design process   A potential client who doesn t have a clear design brief is going to be hard to work with and is one to avoid  That s why I suggest you choose large tech companies to pitch  because they ll have a detailed brief for you to create a pitch from   Below is an example of a real life  extremely specific UX design brief  The exact details are covered for privacy reasons  but as you can see  it s very detailed  The client has already identified most of the problem areas that they want you to solve   What most UX designers do is ask questions during the design brief stage don t do that  This puts the onus on the client to make the UX design decisions when  in fact  they are hiring you to do that   You may be thinking   But what about clients who don t know what they want  What do I do then   If that s the case  it s up to you to spring into action and produce three potential design solutions that allow the client to decide what UX design direction they want you to proceed in   Here are the actual questions I asked Net a porter com that got me to the interview stage    Legacy data aside  do you have any recent data you could share with me to backup the current design    Note  Asking potential clients if they have data to validate the current design will allow you to assess where the current design weaknesses are     Current design aside  what are your UX design outcomes for this project     I recently completed a project exactly like yours that resulted in a 300  revenue increase  Would you like to learn more    The answers to these questions allowed me to produce a tailored pitch identifying real needs and offering potential solutions based on facts  not fantasy   Avoid asking overly specific  and generally useless  questions like  What s your favorite color palette   or  Do you like this typeface    Also avoid asking how much experience they re looking for in their designer  or if they think your experience is enough  Confidence in your design skills will translate into the conversation   Step 4  Preparing the UX design pitch  When you get this step right  the client will think you ve read their mind and the likelihood of you being offered the job is high   What most UX designers do at this point is prepare a design pitch based on how they think the client should proceed  spending hours creating a proposal that doesn t match the client s actual needs  The result is a pitch proposal that totally misses the point   Here are mistakes I ve made in the pitch process before   Creating a complete redesign of the client s website and logo that wasn t asked for or identified in the project brief  Preparing a pitch in English when the language that is spoken in the client s office is German  Including your daily rate in the proposal if it wasn t agreed upon or if the budget wasn t shared during the project brief  In contrast  here s what I did to design the pitch to get the Net a porter com contract   Creating 2 or 3 examples of case studies of design work you did in a previous role that relates to the client s design brief and exceeds expectation  Hosting your case studies  wireframes  sketches  and clickable prototype on InVision so you can present a link to the case studies folder  Stating your strengths and three reasons why you would be a good fit for the client s UX design team  if they have one   Here are the 3 phases of a UX research and design pitch that you can use to present to the client   The discovery phase the research phase The design phase the sketch phase The development production phase the execution and delivery phase  Breaking the pitch proposal down into the 3 stages will provide the structure for the pitch plan  Next to each step  be sure include a timeline  deliverable  and cost based on the client s actual confirmed budget   In the introduction  I summarized the UX design brief and included   The 3 user centered design phases  The tasks associated with achieving each phase  A timeline for completing each phase  I then printed it out on nice stock so that the client would be able to refer to it during the pitch meeting  you could also email it to the customer    Most clients expect to receive proposals within 24 hours of your catch up call  Or  if you would like more impact  you can present it during the actual pitch meeting  It s up to you both ways are acceptable   Step 5  Create a winning pitch using prototypes  So now you ve spoken to the client  you ve got the brief  you ve outlined your pitch  and an interview date is confirmed  Now  what are you going to show them during the pitch   These are the documents and designs I prepared for Net a porter com   Sketched out the user flow based on hierarchy of user needs  Created the wireframes in Sketch  Uploaded the wireframes into InVision  Shared the mobile app with the client  And this is what I showed during the pitch   1  The mobile view wireframe I created in Sketch App for the Net a porter com pitch   2  The mobile web view home screen  uploaded to

461,training-dataset/product/888.txt,product,User testing gone wild  A guide to course correctionSo you have a usability test this afternoon  and you ve thought of everything  You ve built a prototype  written a script  gargled  flossed  and gone through some vocal warmups   Excellent  You are so ready for this   Most of the time  testing sessions go great and your team collects honest  unfiltered feedback  But sometimes the unexpected happens  No matter how much you prepare for an interview or usability test  you still need to stay on your toes and quell some hiccups along the way  These hiccups can come from you  your team  your materials  your environment  the users  etc  Some are obvious  and some are not so obvious   Let s go over the most common user testing problems and ways to address them in the hopes of avoiding them altogether   The participant clams up  They re sweaty  their arms are crossed  and their hands shake when they touch the tablet  Or worse  they start to back away from you  slowly  Body language is the most important indicator of a person s comfort  If they slowly roll their chair to the other end of the table as you speak to them  you need to rethink your approach   How to avoid this   Build a rapport with the user before you transition into testing  If you re at their home or place of business  allow them to greet you and show you around  If they traveled to your office  ask them how their trip was and if they need any refreshments  Shifting the focus onto them shows that you care about their needs and what they have to say   If you re at their home or place of business  allow them to greet you and show you around  If they traveled to your office  ask them how their trip was and if they need any refreshments  Shifting the focus onto them shows that you care about their needs and what they have to say  Learn how to read body language to empathize with your user  Once you become aware of what their body is telling you  you can start to adjust yours accordingly   Once you become aware of what their body is telling you  you can start to adjust yours accordingly   User testing participants should feel comfortable making mistakes   Know that usability tests can be distressing for users  They might not be as familiar with this process as you are  They can easily feel like they re being watched  tested  and judged by a panel of professionals  Not a fun feeling  It s your job to make them feel as comfortable as possible so that you can gain their trust  And having one person facilitate will help them open up and ultimately feel comfortable making mistakes   During the session   Check your posture  Are you crowding them or leaning in too much  Loosen up and give them more breathing room   Check where you re sitting  If you re sitting across from them  swing around and sit next to them to show that you re with them   Ask them if they need a break   Make them laugh  There s no better way to ease the tension   Too many people talking at once  Your team has gone rogue  Everyone started out on their best behavior  The facilitator facilitated  the observer observed  and the note taker took notes  But there s been a shift and everyone is now participating  Your allies are talking over each other  asking questions out of sync and in rapid fire  But wait  You were the one leading this   How to avoid this   During the session   Maintain eye contact with your team  The second you stop looking at each other to give and read cues  you re disconnected and are more likely to act as individuals rather than as a unit   If a teammate is overexcited and talking more than the user  find a non verbal way to tell them to ease up a little  A gentle arm squeeze and smile can go a long way   After the test  remind your team that the user should be doing 99  of the talking  We are merely there to listen and learn   You ran out of questions  You went through that script way faster than intended  The user performed wonderfully and wasn t stuck on anything  But you have a full 20 minutes left before the session ends  You start to get a little nervous  and now you re asking one off rhetorical questions that you know won t tell you much   How to avoid this   Loosen up your script  Write down topics you d like to cover in addition to the questions you want to ask  Having topics allows you to go wherever the conversation leads  rather than sticking to questions that might be rendered irrelevant after the first couple of minutes   Incorporate a bonus section into your script that covers some nice to have questions  These are things that could go unanswered  but would be interesting to ask  For example   If you had a magic wand that could do anything to this app  what would you do    During the session   Ask your user to show you their favorite apps  the ones they used on the way to the session  the ones they find simple or complicated  the ones they can t live without  Have them perform tasks and explain to you what happens at each step  See if they have one that s similar to what you re testing and learn about what works and what doesn t   They don t have a smartphone  Then ask them to tell you some stories  Think about the tasks they ll perform in your app  and ask how they do them now  Even asking about what they did yesterday could be helpful for your research   If you re truly done with the test and feel like your questions have been answered  end early   Your prototype is busted  But it worked in the office  We know  But if it depends on wifi  and you re in a location where it s not available  then you ll have a problem   How to avoid this   Host all of your files locally so you don t need wifi  This includes scripts  images  libraries  etc   Test it yourself before you present it to someone else  Go through all the tasks to make sure it s not broken   Bring the device you ve been testing on  Testing on a new device can throw all sorts of unexpected wrenches   Bring print outs of your screens as a backup plan  Have the user tap on elements and ask what they d expect to happen next   During the session   Turn to paper  If you don t have print outs with you  quickly sketch out the parts of the prototype that you d like to test and ask questions about   If you don t have the time to draw anything yourself  have the user do it  Ask them to draw from memory whatever they tool they are using now to get the job done  Just seeing what they remember will give so much insight to whatever you re building  You can also ask them to draw the ideal interface they would want to use   As mentioned in the previous scenario  asking them to show you apps on their phone and to tell you stories can really help if your prototype is unsalvageable   Your facilitator is leading the witness  They started out just fine  But they gradually spiraled into the land of leading questions with yes or no answers  Now they can t stop starting questions with   Wouldn t it be great if      Do you like it when      Would you use this feature    These types of questions stifle conversation by making it difficult to ask follow up questions   How to avoid this   Spend time with your script and turn any leading questions into open ended ones   When was the last time you      What do you think will happen when you     How often do you      Conduct some practice interviews with your teammates  Two of you can take turns asking each other questions  while a moderator points out examples of open ended or leading questions   It takes time to get into the habit of asking for stories rather than opinions  The more interviews you do  the better you ll get   During the session   Ask the user  why   after some of their answers  This can help open the conversation a bit  and may naturally get things back on track   Communicate to your facilitator via Post it notes  Scribble a gentle reminder asking for  open ended  and  stories    Write down some examples of their leading questions  so you can give them pointers after the interview  Having concrete examples makes it easier to give constructive feedback   The user is stuck on fake data  In your prototype s world   2 00    5 00    10 00  and the user is having a hard time believing it   How to avoid this   Be diligent about the fake data you put in  If you re showing a shopping cart  make sure the prices add up  If you re trying to show a history of orders  make sure that all the dates aren t the same  If you don t want to use any values  draw some scribbles and tell the user that it s data     Don t use lorem ipsum  Use real names and real ish  descriptions  Making your data coherent can save you a lot of time during the test and prevent any confusion  It can also bring up things you didn t realize were issues  like character length   Use real names and real ish  descriptions  Making your data coherent can save you a lot of time during the test and prevent any confusion  It can also bring up things you didn t realize were issues  like character length  Don t use the pictures or names of people they may know  like celebrities  yourself  or your team members  They have the potential to create unwelcome distractions and assumptions about your product   During the session   Take a moment to explain that because this is a prototype  the data is neither real nor relevant for today s test  Be sure to mention this in an intro at the beginning to alleviate any questions or confusion   Keep redirecting their focus to the task at hand   If they really can t see past the fake data  ask them why  Maybe it s not about whether or not 2   5   10  but that they were expecting something else entirely   When all else fails  Take a deep breath and remember that you re all here with the same purpose  to make your product a success  The fact that you re doing usability research shows that you care about your users and want them to love your product as much as you do   So relax and your users will  too   This post was originally published on the thoughtbot blog,"[461 103 188 1322 1337 231 347 891 1259 1388 873]"
479,training-dataset/product/1269.txt,product,UX design trends for 2017The growing area of user experience design is an opportunity for a complete mindset shift for companies away from selling products and towards selling experiences  It s the best way to build a sustainable competitive advantage   Last year  we saw some truly innovative stuff happen in the world of UX  The biggest one  perhaps and our favorite here at CareerFoundry was Pok mon Go  the augmented reality game from Nintendo that became the top grossing app in the US within 13 hours of its release and got 50 2 million people all over the world to walk outside and run into things   It s safe to say we re going to see some bold moves in UX in the coming months  Here are the 5 UX design trends to watch in 2017   1  Time saving design  Great UX is intuitive and saves users time especially linear designs that allow users to take just one action at a time  For example  Uber makes a clear transition through the booking system with simplicity and convenience   But with increasing technologies in the areas of chatbots and artificial intelligence  we re going to see more and more interesting ways of time saving design  Things like basic customer service interactions being handled by artificially intelligent chatbots won t just save users time  but will also save the time of the company s employees time that can then be spent on innovation   Related  The ultimate guide to chatbots  2  Smarter personalization  Companies and users both love personalization  But in 2016  personalization of information brought some unpleasant surprises  Many people found themselves shocked by the results of Brexit and the US presidential election  as their social circles gave them the perception that the whole world shared their opinion   The next generation of personalized experience must change  Expect more options to be able to opt out of binary reporting  or consciously add in opposing opinions to places like Facebook s News Feed and news sites  article recommendations   3  Metrics beyond the interface  Traditional methods of measuring user experience include how long a user spends on a site  their movement through the pages  or where they drop off before purchasing  But as more and more experience goes beyond the digital and the experience becomes the product businesses will start watching more experience based metrics to track the engagement impact  such as the positive contribution to the customer s life   Snapchat Spectacles is a great example of a company creating a seamless integration of a digital product into the user s life it s a fashionable accessory that streamlines the way users interact with Snapchat  without the need for the phone platform  It positively impacts the user by supplying them with a multi purpose object that s a simple and easy way to share experiences with friends  Expect some interesting insights here   4  Broader UX roles and specialization  UX has always been a broad category  but in 2017  specialization will trend towards new technologies and industries like virtual reality  artificial intelligence  and industries like health and fitness   As the experience becomes the product  companies must learn that UX is not just the role of the UX designer everyone needs to learn it to take ownership of different goals during development  Everyone who plays a role in developing a user facing element is part of the UX team   5  UX as a management practice  Forward thinking companies see the benefit and importance of UX design in product and service offerings for their customers  But what will become more prevalent in 2017 and beyond is the importance of UX design for employees   We ll see leaders putting themselves in the shoes of employees and really going through their user journey  critically questioning an employee s experience of what happens when they bring forward ideas  start executing on them  and even what happens if they fail  This experience will have a big impact on motivating employees to bring innovation into all aspects of the business   Which UX trends are you excited about this year  Tell us on Twitter   InVisionApp,"[479 75 274 341 1137 355 1388 145 1083 1322 1230]"
483,training-dataset/product/845.txt,product,How to bring modular architecture to your design documentationI m Codal s resident technical writer  Because I work among a group of UX specialists  I often take note of practices that are common in other fields  yet are criminally underused in UX   Here s one for you  modular documentation   Modular documentation was designed to streamline workflow  help with organization  and promote reusability  But its key benefit is that project stakeholders can access any piece of documentation at any moment without derailing you from your work   No more sending documents  attaching files  or uploading documentation to project management systems  Simply notify the stakeholders that the modular document has been updated  and leave the rest up to them   What in the world is modular documentation   Modular documentation is exactly what it sounds like  You create a central  hub  document that follows a modular architecture  linking out to strategically grouped  microdocuments   The document groups are called  topics  and they re centralized within topic folders   Consider this modular documentation glossary   It may seem like these definitions are generalized and irrelevant to the UX industry  That s because you re right  This is an adaptable system it works in technical writing  it works in UX  and it works in administrative environments   As a system  modular documentation can bring value to nearly any industry where documentation is frequently created and used  In the context of UX  modular documentation holds the key to unprecedented organization and communication   Why should you care  For starters  your stakeholders will love it  They ll be able to view any piece of documentation with ease and with proper context   Other teams  such as the development and visual design teams  will be able to easily locate any and all assets  Just give them access to the master document   If you work for a company with a huge design team  assets like logos  colors  and style guides may often be reused from project to project  Modular documentation was originally designed specifically for reusability   So  what does a modular framework look like   You may be thinking  But how do I implement this new way of documenting things  Here s how   Create your master file and topic folders  It all starts with the master folder  Simply create a folder and name it after the project it s intended to serve  Ideally you d name the folder  Project Name   For example  if this were created for Showroom Squared  one of our clients here at Codal  you d call it  Showroom Squared    We use Google Drive for our file organization it saves time when sharing documentation  and it s secure  You can use whatever you like Google Drive  Microsoft OneDrive  a plain old folder on your desktop  At the end of the day  it doesn t matter   Create the master document  This can be a Google Document or a Word File  depending on your chosen file organization system  Name it  ProjectName Master   So  in keeping with the above example  we d name this document  Showroom Master    Next  provide a brief description of the project and scaffold out your link structure by determining your topics  Don t worry about listing every possible topic at first you can add or change topics as you develop your documentation  That s the beauty of modularity   The topics in your master document will correspond  and subsequently link  to topic folders  Be sure to leave room below your topics for a section with microdocument links  At this point  your master document should look like this   Now  create your topic folders within the master folder  In keeping with the above example  we d create 4 topic folders   Discovery   Planning    Research   Strategy    Conceptual Design   and  Detailed Design   Link these folders within the master document   The topic folders you ve just created will contain all manner of microdocuments  from sprint plans  to surveys  to user tests  to sitemaps  to interactive prototypes anything relevant to the project   Put absolutely everything into a microdocument  Quick refresher  A microdocument is a specific  focused piece of documentation   In the realm of UX  this means everything you create for the project  up to and including the actual designs  will become its own microdocument   As you go about creating these microdocuments  make sure to do 3 things   Give them descriptive names Add the microdocument to the appropriate topic folder Create a link to the microdocument at the bottom of the master document  create a section for this in the same style as you did for the topic links   Eventually  your completed master document should look like this   Your master document is a living  breathing document  The list of topics and microdocuments will grow and shrink as the project progresses   Anyone with access to the master document will be able to find a specific microdocument  or view all microdocuments within a particular topic  depending on their needs   Conclusion  Modularize your UX documentation  Ready to modularize your UX documentation  It all starts with the chart  If you want to create modular documentation for sales content  for example  you d create a chart like this   Structure your documentation in a way that makes sense to you  and to everyone involved   The rest is simply a matter of following the advice presented within this guide,"[483 555 387 1167 510 1137 434 698 67 75 341]"
489,training-dataset/product/1219.txt,product,3 reasons why the world needs more experience designersContrary to the common portrayal of designers  experience designers do more than make things pretty  In fact  some of us aren t even able to do that  Some experience designers just have a brain that lends itself to thinking of ways to make life better for everyone  but they need others to help bring their ideas to life   If we had more experience designers in the world  life would be better for everyone  Here s why   1  Experience designers understand the path of least resistance  The path of least resistance is the easiest way to get anything done   Ever meet someone that you and everyone else considered to be a slacker  Yet every time something was due they d have it done and  more often than not  done better than most  If they re not already  this person is probably meant to be an experience designer   As experience designers  we create experiences that are incredibly easy to use because our lives are based around making things easy for ourselves  The best experience designers are typically those slacker kids you grew up with who figured out life s algorithm at an early age   2  Experience designers see the big picture  When it comes to just about anything in life  it s important to have the big picture in mind but it s easy to get lost in the details  Experience designers aim to understand opportunity costs  and because of this we re perpetually running cost benefit analyses   This analytical understanding of life leads to better budgeting of our time  better prioritizing of tasks  and generally better life experiences  In a world of instant gratification  it s great to be surrounded by people who make decisions after thinking them through   3  Experience designers put people first  The best experience designers have a strong grasp of human behavior  But they also know that they re not always right  And when a good designer gets stumped  they ask questions   Instead of assuming they know the answer  a great experience designer will ask people what they think of the idea and what could make it better   The core of experience design is putting the human first  If everyone in the world did that  we d live in a communities based on empathy instead of power  We d work together to bring impactful ideas to life instead of keeping them to ourselves for the sake of success  And we d understand that the whole is greater than the sum of any individual parts   More from Joe Toscano  How to design for global meaning and attention  Global experience  party of 6 billion  Whether it be through making some new technology to save the planet or just making someone s day  the mindset required to be an experience designer is something that would extend value to the world   As you go about your day  try your hardest to think about others and make the world simpler  If you don t know what someone is thinking or how they re feeling  ask them don t assume  If someone is doing something that could be simplified to make their life easier  educate them how don t stand by and watch  And if you have something you want to do because you think it ll make the world a better place but can t do it alone  reach out for help   Putting experience design into every interaction  digital or not  will only make our world a better place   This was originally published on Medium,"[489 573 1137 1079 543 479 355 145 1094 653 1167]"
510,training-dataset/business/826.txt,business,5 Reasons Why Startups Need an Online Project Management SoftwareCould your company benefit from project management software  Read below to see how software could be an affordable  easy to use  and potentially company saving option for an early stage startup that doesn t want to risk the chaos of doing business without a project manager   Project management is one of the most important  if not the most important processes in business  In most cases it can mean the difference between a business succeeding or facing a complete downfall  While being a big company and having one or a few projects fail might not affect your revenue in a big way  with small organizations this might not be the case   Unchecked growth of a project s scope  unrealistic timeframes and poor planning are just some of the reasons that could cause a project to halt  leaving the startup with no capital  no clients  penalties to be paid and no other options than to declare bankruptcy and close the doors   Thanks to the rapid developments in the field of specialized business software there is now a solution with a lot of potential that startups can use in project management  It is not uncommon that young entrepreneurs don t have the capital to hire a professional with specialized project management experience who will be able to handle complications and take care of project specific challenges in real time   When markets are oversaturated and the competition is becoming harsh  startups can use online project management software to become more competitive and stand out from the crowd  This tool can also help startups establish a steady growth by increasing their project success rates  so let s explore some of the reasons why young entrepreneurs should use project tracking software   Simple Project Planning  The user interface of project management software is really simple and intuitive  Once you enter all your resources and assets you have access to tools that could easily make a project management artist out of you  A simple spreadsheet and timetable are imbedded to help you arrange tasks in order dictated by a given project  On top of that  project tracking software comes with project templates that are ready for use   It seems that enhancing business efficiency is where this type of software truly shines   tasks are created easily  deadlines and expenses can be added to each task explicitly  once created tasks can be assigned to specific team members etc  The list goes on  Once every project task is set up  a project can begin with one simple click that invites team members and delegates predetermined responsibilities to them   Oversee Projects with Ease  Project management paperwork keeps exponentially piling up during project execution  This really makes it hard to track down everything and identify any possible problems  Reports from yesterday are in the filling room or the cabinet  the current status can be determined only by contacting every asset directly  interrupting their work and losing time writing messages  emails or making phone calls  All of these can delay the project and further increase the expenses   Project tracking tools allow you to see all of the projects as they happen  With direct access to the project s current status  small organizations get extra time to focus on their core business operations  These tools have a built in notification system that informs the manager of progress and time and money spent  With so much valuable information  young entrepreneurs can easily plan future endeavors for their business   Cut Costs  Its simple cloud computing lets you focus on what s important   your business  With workloads that share server infrastructure with other organizations  computing needs  you don t need to spend money on expensive IT structure  This way  your business will have spare funds for other investments  and on top of that all your project data will be stored in the cloud  accessible to both you and all team members around the clock   Project management software is also available on smartphone devices  which means that you will be able to manage tasks wherever you are  The notification system will then inform your staff members  With everyone being kept in the loop projects can be closed even before the deadline   Add Flexibility  In most cases  a project doesn t go as planned  They are rife with uncertainty  and we have already mentioned how project success is imperative for startups  With an online project management tool  since it is cloud based  everything can be adjusted and updated in real time  And we mean everything   Permissions can be added for each team member so he she can make changes immediately after something starts deviating from the plan  This provides a realistic view of the project and allows your whole team to evolve from a reactive to a proactive approach   In case a small organization is working on two or more projects  the resources and assets can be switched from one project to another in just a few clicks  as needed  Also  the tasks can be arranged in task dependencies groups  so that when you have to extend a deadline for one task or if one task is completed before the predetermined time  you can move the dates for all the tasks at the same time  This time saving feature is very important for startups  as they have limited staff resources   Increase Productivity  As you can see  project tracking tool helps in streamlining the processes needed to complete the projects  This comes in handy for businesses  especially startups  since more work can be done with fewer people  All of these features have a direct impact on productivity  something every startup needs if it wants to reach success   File sharing and collaboration features are also standard parts of project management tools  Commenting on tasks and document sharing enhance the flow of the whole process  making it more efficient  Furthermore  this software provides transparency of the whole project  ensuring a more democratic system where everyone knows their responsibilities and the effect these have on other team members and the project as a whole   As you can see  some of these reasons are really compelling  Online projecgt management software still has a role to play in the world of startups  Keep in mind that project success rates influence business growth  customer retention and satisfaction  If this software interests you and you want to find out more about it  feel free to search the web and see all the benefits of good project planning and execution   David Miller is a researcher who has several years of experience in the field of teaching  project management and training  He is

with them so you can enjoy a new gifographic once a day in your inbox  Get the other 24 by subscribing here   As a designer  if you ve ever had to hand off your visual wonder to a developer  then you know the dread that sometimes follows   Is what you envisioned even possible to get to work from a development perspective   Does the developer know the functionality you had in mind   Does your developer even develop   The list can go on and on  But there are always 2 sides to a story  What about the developer who s waiting on the design   To answer that question and others  we ve interviewed our own team at KlientBoost to come up with these 6 tips for better designer developer collaboration   It all begins with focusing on the user  Designers and developers should always work with the end user in mind   If the experience isn t better for the user  then there s no point in designing or building anything out your new efforts won t be aligned with business goals   So whether you re designing a new site or developing new features into a product  from the start design and development teams should have the common goal to improve the user experience   But how do you figure out what s best for the user  Testing   According to Tin Kadoic at Five  user experience and product testing start as early as the first week of the project  And the testing for improved user experience doesn t stop anytime during the lifetime of the project  either   Related  Streamline your design to development workflow with Inspect by InVision  The Nielsen Norman Group gives us a checklist both designers and developers should follow when it comes to usability testing   Once the pre testing phase is complete  design and development teams are more closely aligned and know what to focus on   The earlier  the better  Often  development teams won t know anything about a project until the design files hit their desk  If those design files are impossible to implement  that means the designer wasted time and now has to go back to the drawing board   To prevent that from happening  designers and developers need to work together from the start  Early involvement ensures that all parties stay on the same page with the same focus at all times   If this doesn t happen  then delays and or redesigns are likely to arise  which leads to frustration and upset stakeholders   A study by the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management at the University of Oulu in Finland found that early collaboration with all parties on a project lead to   Lowered chance of developing poor designs  Much higher satisfaction regarding the product s function and usage for the end user  Room for creative solutions and the intensive exchange of ideas before it s too late  Designers and developers are no different in this regard   Stronger systems  better processes  When all teams have the tools and knowledge to get something done  things usually get done   But one of the common oversights you ll find between designers and developers are sometimes simple things like   Naming conventions  Sizes  Margins  Paddings  Grids  Having a standardized order of operations and a way of going about them help speed things up  since time won t be spent on questions that could easily be answered   This helps for a clear focus by both designers and developers that won t get bogged down by logistical issues   When it comes to systems and processes  this is also where you want to have a thorough checklist that each team goes through before moving the project on to the next phase   Which leads us to   Before the handoff  If you ve followed all our tips until this point  then you definitely realize how valuable it is to deliver a project with all your boxes checked off  ready for the next phase   As designers near the completion of their work  it s important to reflect back on the original goals of the project to make sure it passes their inspection   Questions like the ones below help you find any updates that need to happen before passing the project along to the development team   Is design quality high and are you proud of it   Does the design improve the user experience   Has the design been tested on real customers   By answering yes to all of the above  you lower the chances of any need for re work or re designs   It ll be tough to go back and forth once your designs are in a developer s hands   How s it going  x 10  You know you can read tone and body language when you re facing someone  but all that goes away when you read a text or an email  It s the same thing that happens with designers and developers   Once a project has been moved from one set of hands to another  there s a good chance that interpretation between team members will be different   Did you mean for your design to do X or Y   By having frequent check ins between designers and developers  you re able to keep the project moving along by removing communication and interpretation bottlenecks   Pragmatic communication  The more projects you have designers and developers work on together  the higher the chances of potential frustration   With our teams at KlientBoost  we ve found it s easy to forget that we re all on the same team with one common goal  By having the self awareness and empathy when you communicate with other team members  you re able to quickly find a logical solution to any problem that may occur   And by following the previous 5 tips  you can lay a solid communication foundation that prevents problems from arising in the first place   Now it s your turn  Teams that communicate openly and frequently build better products  Try out these 6 tips at your organization  and we think you ll find that projects are smoother and quicker and people have more fun  too,"[543 573 891 1388 145 555 67 653 614 1322 75]"
555,training-dataset/business/1237.txt,business,Figuring out UX flow for better team cooperationThe start of development has always been a challenge for me  because explaining UX work to developers is hard   Traditionally  I d walk everyone through a prototype  summarize a roadmap  explain features  and more  And once I finished going through all of that  I d still get a lot of questions about the app and then a ton of follow up questions   At 10Clouds  our flow from the designer  me  to our developers was inefficient  We needed a new approach  And I needed to figure out how to effectively communicate with the team without extensive documentation on my end   Related  3 ways to improve collaboration between designers and developers  Keeping it lean  Some techniques exist  such as use cases  sitemaps  and task flows  They re designed to help  but it would be best to use a couple of them for proper documentation  And  honestly  it s hard to update them in an agile environment   Lean UX is against extensive documentation because team collaboration should be at the center  The problem happens if you rely only on mockups you ll end up explaining the same things over and over again   If you want to invest time into an artifact  it should engage the whole team by improving communication and keeping everyone on the same page   Flow redesigned  I needed a new tool to help our team flow stay lean  agile  and effective  I started by writing down the things I needed to communicate  looking to outline the project without getting into too many details   Then I created a flow diagram as a base  and started mapping the key views  Only then did I move on to adding details  drawing mockups  testing different fidelities  writing down features and listing the data to show   Here s the finished flow   This version just felt right  I shared the flow with our developers and braced for an extensive Q and A  Instead  they got it right away we all felt awesome about it  and it s worked wonders for us   Designing in flows  So what makes this flow work so well   Designers focus on users  but in a team environment  the system perspective is just as important  Developers usually have to imagine the whole system before they can start planning their work  They need to know how big the app is  how complex the views are  and what can be reused   Typically  all of that has to happen before you start prototyping   There are a few things that can help a team deal with it   A low fidelity representation of each view shows its complexity  Will there be a grid view  A table  Are there any tabs  You can present all that with a simple sketch  At this point  it will be enough to decide if the design is going to take the whole sprint to implement  or just a small part of it   Will there be a grid view  A table  Are there any tabs  You can present all that with a simple sketch  At this point  it will be enough to decide if the design is going to take the whole sprint to implement  or just a small part of it  List all information that will be visible on the screen  The data you show affects the database structure  filters  and search criteria you can use  It s much easier for the team to imagine the desired outcome of their work if you list everything at the outset   The data you show affects the database structure  filters  and search criteria you can use  It s much easier for the team to imagine the desired outcome of their work if you list everything at the outset  Annotate arrows to explain the navigation  Links between views are another crucial element of the flow  Arrows help you show the structure of the app  Annotating them also describes which features will be available   Even though I focused on developers  this diagram supports the whole team  Project management can see where the team is in the process  and UI designers know how much work they have left   Oh  and did I mention that UX work is much easier  too  No more missing links or forgotten views   Wrapping up  The flow diagram has become a standard approach for me when communicating with the team   And it s not only about communication  Flow helps maintain consistency in design and speed up development  It s an essential part of the entire design process at my company and maybe it could also help yours   Read more posts about team communication,"[555 543 891 573 1291 618 260 717 972 1388 75]"
573,training-dataset/product/551.txt,product,Designing and engineering better teams to build better productsWorking with engineers is such a pain   If you ve spent any measurable amount of time working on digital product teams  you ve likely overheard or been a part of a familiar conversation  The designers are upset because the deliverable they spent hours  weeks  and months getting just right isn t being implemented the way they want   Why is this happening  Don t the engineers know how much time was spent getting the stakeholders to approve the direction  Why aren t they even attempting to adhere to the documentation that was meticulously crafted   Related  6 tasty ways for designers and developers to collaborate better  Working with designers is such a nightmare   A few doors down  we enter another room in the same office where the engineering team is having a similar conversation  Don t these designers know that this would be near impossible to code  Why are they asking for this data  It s going to be such a complex database query  Can t they just take this data that we already have and use it as is  How on earth do they expect me to implement this  The codebase just doesn t work like this   Over the top and overly dramatic  Most certainly  These 2 accounts may be greatly overblown  but the themes are all too common  Two or more groups on the same team all working toward the same goal  but instead of collaborating  they sit in separate rooms complaining about the lack of understanding   It s all too easy to fall into the trap of assumption  We assume that other teams are either completely ignoring our hard work or even worse  that they just don t care  But I don t think I m making a sweeping judgment here by saying this is generally not the case  Only a small handful of people purposely aim to derail a project for the sake of just doing things their way  Sure  it isn t unheard of  but my optimistic mind knows that it is not the norm   Great  it s broken  How will I fix it   My background falls smack dab in the middle of design and development  I lean much more heavily on the design side these days  but I ve worked in many different roles across a number of cross functional teams  Some of the most successful teams I ve had the opportunity to be a part of have all shared a common characteristic  mutual understanding   So how do you get to this understanding  especially when it feels like an impossible hill to climb  The following tips  while aimed at designers  are broad enough to benefit any member of a digital team  Let s all sit in the same room and maybe even pull up chairs next to one another   There are most certainly someone else s shoes  Empathy is a fairly common theme when creating products digital or otherwise  Putting yourself in the shoes of the end user is paramount to successfully producing products that adapt and accommodate to the ever changing needs of your users  Great products strive to provide experiences that allow users to quickly accomplish their tasks while recognizing and planning for when things go horribly wrong   If empathy for the end user is so important to ensuring project success  I would argue that empathy for your teammates is equally  if not more important  Take time to understand the underlying factors behind the decisions and actions of your team member  There is a fairly strong chance that there s a logical reason why someone isn t doing things the way you want  need  or ask them to do  Your  1 job is to find out what this reason is   Products and software have become increasingly complex  Engineers are generally juggling platform limitations  legacy codebases  and technical debt  Maybe they re approaching a problem a certain way because that s how it has always been done  Furthermore  there may be outside issues or concerns that you aren t privy to  There could be personality differences amongst team members  Any number of issues may exist that  without context  may make it look like an engineer is just ignoring your hard work and doing things the way they want  Again  your  1 job is to find out what these reasons are    One great building does not make a great city    Thomas Heatherwick  It s becoming more common to have teams comprised of designers who can code  engineers who can design  and project managers who can do a bit of both  Maybe you fit into this mold  maybe you don t  Either way  it s super important to have at least general knowledge of how the project you re working on is put together  Learn about the various systems and how they re all connected  Ask an engineer to walk you through how they ve implemented your designs  You don t need to be an expert or be able to code it yourself  but high level knowledge of general concepts will empower you to make better design decisions   It s equally important for the people building the product to understand some of the principles that made the design come together the way it did  Again  the expectation is not to turn the engineering team into design experts  We re really just striving to build a mutual understanding of each team s process  The easiest way to do this is to group designers and engineers together based on the problems they re trying to solve  Have engineers give lunch and learn presentations to the design team  Ask the design team to teach quick classes to engineers  Find ways for the entire team to be familiar with as many aspects of the project as possible   Combine like Voltron  One of the best ways for a team to feel ownership of a project when it ships is to get everyone involved from the start  The beginning of a project shouldn t involve the design team going off to workshop ideas while the engineering team sets up its development environments  Obviously  these are tasks that need to be done  but there has to be collaboration right at the beginning  Designers  this is your time to get members of the engineering team involved in design workshops  Sit together and hash out a wireframe or flow  Some of the most interesting solutions come out of jam sessions between designers and engineers   The other important benefit in early collaboration between engineers and designers is much more tactical  At the beginning of a project  brainstorming can and will wander into unpredictable territory  which is the key to getting good ideas  However  once things start to get a little more concrete  it s good to have engineers present who can start to think of things from a technology and implementation standpoint  There s nothing better than being able to get early indication that your great idea may require major system work  but if slightly reworked  could be feasible with existing resources   See the forest for the trees  Designers are stereotyped as being anal retentive perfectionists  Every design detail is analyzed in great detail  The color has to be perfect  the spacing tight  and the type just right  Self admittedly  I frequently find myself zoomed in at 5000  sweating every pixel just to zoom out to see something absolutely unusable  I m sure there are engineers who would say the same thing   Sometimes  you have to step back and remember that a lot of thinking and activity has taken place well before you started working on your part of the project  Taking the time to understand why the project is where it is right now is core to its overall success  Everything we build is the melding of our user needs  business requirements  technology constraints  and research  All of these moving parts involve a number of different people with a number of different skill sets  that you may or may not have   While it s important to sweat the details  it s equally important to not get lost in them  It s a valuable skill to be able to quickly evaluate prioritization of project details  Is this something mission critical or just something that happens to be a bee in my bonnet  How many other folks involved will be affected by changing or updating this   Go forth and be awesome  Teamwork can be amazingly gratifying and tiring at the same time  It s important to note that every engagement is different and some of these tips may or may not apply to your situation  With that said  I d love to hear some of your tips for creating awesome cross functional teams  What has worked great  What hasn t worked   This post was originally published on the Cantina blog   More on designer developer communication,"[573 543 145 717 1137 1388 489 1094 1322 555 1167]"

614,training-dataset/product/1347.txt,product,On designer self awarenessEditor s note  We ve asked a handful of design leaders to respond to prompts each week  This week s prompt was  What s the best advice you ve received from a mentor   Check out Nick Schaden s answer below  and submit your own response to our Medium publication   Early in my career  I had a one on one session with my boss where I vented my frustrations about a tough design project I was in the middle of   Years later  I ve forgotten the problem  but I distinctly remember his response  He said I was bumping into a weak point in my skillset  It wasn t easy  but I was learning my strengths and weaknesses in the process  As he put it   Self awareness is one of the greatest skills any designer can master    I ve worked in technology for over a decade now  and those words still ring true  Awareness of our strengths and weaknesses is important for growth  It helps with team collaboration and even our day to day enjoyment of our work   Granted  self awareness can be an asset in many careers  But it s especially important for designers because design is fluid  It covers a wide spectrum of work  from user research to visual design  Generalist product designer roles are increasingly in demand because most design teams need designers to be flexible and jump in on multiple points along that design spectrum during a project s life cycle   That fluidity at work puts extra pressure on us  as designers  to define our strengths and weaknesses  When you know what you re solid at  you ll know what projects to push for during planning phases  As you re assigned work that touches on your weak points  you ll know to lean on others for support   It s a common mantra that successful designers are often  T shaped   They have deep skill and mastery in select design areas with more generalist knowledge elsewhere  Self aware designers know how close they are to that ideal and can shift accordingly for a new project or company   For example  a designer might be a masterful illustrator but has poor networking skills  They ve got the depth but lack breadth  With strong awareness  they start pushing for more generalist projects where they have to interact with many people  Another example  an agency designer skips among different projects and skills  She s aware her depth is lacking  and since she s interested in research  she takes courses in user research and usability testing   Knowing your strengths and gaps gets you hired and promoted  We remember candidates for their standout strengths  and we often hire to fill gaps  If you sell what you re best at  while being forthright about your areas of growth  you ll have a better shot at moving up   Self awareness also helps with outward confidence and charisma  I ve known designers  myself included  screw up a great project or job without understanding what went wrong until well after the fact  They had the skills  but they failed to project how they were skilled until it was too late   Self awareness is a critical first step to avoid this  When you know you re good at something  you speak from a position of authority and clarity  You can proactively help others  And subsequently  you re more likely to be on a team and project that matches what you re after  When something isn t your strong suit  you re humble enough to ask others for assistance   Admittedly  understanding yourself is only one of many factors in a design career  But without it  I don t think I would be where I am today   This post represents my personal views   More responses to this prompt,"[614 543 1079 573 1137 1114 808 653 1322 1083 489]"
618,training-dataset/product/1453.txt,product,Redesigning a CRMMore than 48 000 real estate agents use ZapLabs  customer relationship management  CRM  software to manage their contacts  A good CRM should enhance the value of managing contacts  but our CRM didn t provide any ability to filter or search contacts within the page   In order to improve usability  a complete redesign of the CRM s contacts list view was in order  Here s the story of how I lead the charge   The challenge  Our users were comfortable using the CRM as it was  so getting them to switch to an entirely new system one they d have to spend time learning was a huge deal  I d need to back up my redesign proposal with data in order to convince everyone especially my company that we really did need to completely redesign our CRM and not just make some quick improvements   Gathering data  The best way to propose redesign ideas is with convincing data in hand  Have you ever wondered why your redesign ideas get rejected  Perhaps this feedback sounds familiar to you    Our development team doesn t have the bandwidth for this redesign they re way too busy building new features     Why do we need a redesign  I don t see any problems     Are you sure a redesign is better than what we already have  Is it worth making the investment in time and effort    Without compelling data  don t expect the naysayers to change their minds   To get the data I needed  I went to our online community and searched for related questions and suggestions for improvement  I categorized them and identified problems  and then I sat down with product managers to go over the findings and my suggestions  This got people onboard  so I was able to move full speed ahead   Identifying the problem  When users clicked on the contacts tab  there was a fly out menu for different categories of contacts  such as starred contacts  leads  and prospects  But users often weren t sure about where a contact might belong  so they d default to all contacts  Users also couldn t search within the list view and filter their contacts   Sketching ideas  Based on community suggestions  I started to sketch out ideas on paper  see below   I went through a few rounds of different ideas and decided that version 4 was the best option for redesign round 1   I removed the fly out menu and replaced it with page tabs to switch contact types  I also put both filter and sort under the  all filter  button  added in a page search  and added in a new contact button   User testing  Round 1   Every redesign project should follow the development cycle  analyze user data and improve the designs  build the new designs  test them out again  define and analyze the new findings to plan out the next steps and iterate on designs   In this stage  I   Built a prototype  I created mockups based on the version 4 sketch and put a prototype together using InVision   I created mockups based on the version 4 sketch and put a prototype together using InVision  Created moderator guidelines  I listed out study goals and defined user testing questions   I listed out study goals and defined user testing questions  Recruited participants  I segmented a group of participants and invited them to join a filter sort study  I used Intercom to recruit users and track user activities   I segmented a group of participants and invited them to join a filter sort study  I used Intercom to recruit users and track user activities  Conducted prototype tests with colleagues friends first to make sure everything worked as expected   with colleagues friends first to make sure everything worked as expected  Conducted remote user testing  I talked to users to learn what worked well and what needed improvement   I talked to users to learn what worked well and what needed improvement  Analyzed user testing data  I analyzed all findings with my teammates to highlight top issues and successes   I analyzed all findings with my teammates to highlight top issues and successes  Created a user testing report  I documented all key findings  the task success rate  and next steps  I used it to define redesign success and walk everyone through what we learned and achieved   After testing  I applied what we learned and started iterating   More sketching  Because there were more filter requests from both our users and management  I had to think about how to add in a bunch of new filters without complicating the user flow  I then undertook another round of sketches to see which offered the best design  see below    Leveraging design principles  Here  I struggled with prioritizing efficiency versus clarity  I wanted to display the most popular filters upfront with radio buttons to reduce the number of task clicks required  But I soon realized that my initial concept wasn t compatible with the massive amount of information required and that I could group such information better   This was the perfect opportunity to apply our newly defined design principles in practice  I decided to prioritize clarity over efficiency  It meant that I had to make sure users can easily scan and discover information before they re asked to do any tasks  Users won t mind extra clicks as long as the system provides accurate feedback   If you ever have trouble making design tradeoffs  just leverage your design principles  Design principles can vary depending on your product  there are no fixed rules  If your team doesn t have any principles  check out Design Principles FTW for inspiration   I made all filters drop down menus for the following reasons   To save vertical space especially on tablets  The filters drop down menu will expand and push down the Contacts list view   We don t have data to decide which filter options we should display up front  This grouping made more sense and was easier to scan and discover  Additionally  I removed the contacts relationship tabs and grouped them under an optional  relationship  dropdown   User testing  Round 2   Here s what I did   Built a prototype and created new mockups based on version 4  based on version 4 Repeated everything I did during round 1  Iterating on designs again  Better design doesn t happen overnight it goes through the cycle of user testing  design  and iteration   Development  During this stage  it s up to your product team to decide whether to do a third round of user testing  We were confident with what we learned  and we needed to roll out the new features soon  so we just went straight to the next step   Finalizing mockups  A redesign can t happen without developers  As soon as your project gets developers assigned to it  connect with them  At this point in our redesign  I worked with our developers to figure out the best ways to implement the design and we were able to work together to make it happen   Related  Designing with your developer in mind  Tip  Be your own advocate  While working on a project  you may have experienced this not so fun scenario  Your design decisions are suddenly no longer in line with what your manager wants  What do you do   Stand up for yourself  As I mentioned before  use data to back up your ideas and get your team s support  As designers  our goal shouldn t just be to make our boss happy it should be to create a better experience for users and a better product that generates more revenue   Conclusion  Some of the most important lessons I learned from this project   Data is a designer s best friend  Do your homework before you jump into a redesign   Do your homework before you jump into a redesign  User testing is key  Moderated user test sessions can be draining  But the feeling of accomplishment at the end is worth it   Moderated user test sessions can be draining  But the feeling of accomplishment at the end is worth it  Document what you learned and achieved  Don t just talk about what you can do show what you ve done   Be organized  Make sure you know where and how to find files to support your design

everyone on board   ZapLabs  redesigned CRM launches December 2,"[618 1322 188 891 231 145 1259 1157 543 1388 347]"

698,training-dataset/product/1292.txt,product,How Stack Overflow Redesigned the Top NavigationYou may have noticed that we re sporting a new look today   We launched this update today as part of a series of changes supporting our core mission  Make developers  lives better  In the past year  we fully integrated our by developers  for developers Jobs product  We added a whole new content type   Documentation   to help you find even more solutions to your programming questions  And we added Developer Story to help developers ditch the outdated resume format   During this time  we also evolved our product development process to include more user research  allowing us to validate ideas earlier and surface more users  voices  There s a ton you can learn by watching people try to use a feature   things that don t get uncovered when directly soliciting feedback  As both product and process expanded  it quickly became apparent that Stack Overflow had outgrown some of our previous design decisions   A Common Theme  A pattern surfaced when talking to users  even with the addition of Jobs and Documentation to the navigation  many developers weren t aware of the change  Digging deeper  we discovered that many weren t really seeing the top bar at all   a  mental block  so effective that most users also couldn t identify what the icons meant   Here s what a few of you said    When I come here I m on a mission  I don t care about the rest    You re only there for 1 reason  to find the answer to your question    From my point of view  nothing above the question title exists    I scroll down and read the question    The data validated our hypothesis   of the average 9 3 million daily visits to Stack Overflow  we get fewer than 88 000 clicks to the navigation or top bar  this includes inbox  rep  profile  and search   If you divided each individual click per visit  that s fewer than 1  of visits navigating anywhere  and far fewer if you counted multiple clicks per visit   Our navigation is not being used by 99  of our users   The common use case for millions of daily visitors is  come from Google  scroll to middle of the page to a find an answer  without seeing the nav and sometimes evening ignore the question itself   and leave  This workflow makes sense   and we love helping the world s developers gain programming knowledge quickly   but this also means many visitors don t benefit from everything that Stack Overflow has to offer  If they re not aware  then we re less effective in helping more developers share their knowledge by finding questions to answer  advance their career search  utilize Documentation  or become contributing members of our community   We hypothesized that a lack of engagement with the nav was due to a combination of browsing habits  visual hierarchy  and the right hand position of the layout  Based on research about F shaped reading patterns and how readers  eyes commonly move down the page  it made sense that our navigation was sub optimal for most people   We also hypothesized that the focal point of the page  the logo  caused many users to skip over the small top bar  Plus the nav and top bar quickly scroll out of view when moving down the page   The product design team then did a design sprint  Each designer created their own design of the top nav and then converged to critique and identify the strongest ideas  The team then combined the best parts of their ideas into one design  The main thinking generated from the sprint   Remove clutter and group similar information in a way that s more quickly parsable  Stick the navigation to the top of the page so that users who are scrolling quickly to answers or arriving from answer or comment links still have access to search or navigate the site  Use navigation design patterns more commonly found in contemporary web apps  Design the navigation as shorthand for the Stack Overflow brand  Stack Overflow users compared the new screens against the current navigation in focus groups at three tech companies  Here s a sampling of what we heard about the current version of the top bar    I m not even sure if the black bar is new    I logically filter out the stuff that I know I m not looking for    Nav looks like tags   they might filter  but they don t look like navigation  Makes you question what it is so I don t click it and instead go back to Google that I m familiar with    I m signed in and I still don t know what those  inbox  achievements  mean    Jumbled stuff at the top that you have to read and decipher    Black bar is kinda  doesn t look like it belongs  all else is white  grey  orange    And the new version    On the current nav I didn t know what the inbox   rep icons were  on the new one I know what every button will do    I know I can search  I know I can go to Jobs    Much more modern  this one    I like the old black bar  but I like that I know what I m getting myself into on the new one    A lot less noise  more signal    Cleaner  more organized  Instead of jumbled stuff at top you have to read and decipher you can go to this    More standardized position that you re used to on other sites    Project Definition  At this point there was enough info to make the top navigation redesign an actual project  The nav is an area of the site that touches so many different use cases  user types  and metrics  it was important to tightly scope the project and clearly define the goals in advance in order to ship quickly  To mitigate scope creep  feature parity to the current navigation was the defined scope  with a few exceptions    Primary goals  Present all the tools we provide for developers in a way that s consistent with them actually discovering them  Increase traffic to Jobs and Documentation  More intuitive  updated visual design  Increase the number of users who sign up and gain access to more site features  Secondary goals  Increase in notifications acknowledged  Increase or no decline in searches  No decline in questions asked  And a handful of other important and boring metrics that we simply didn t want to screw up  The progressive rollout plan to measure success had the following objectives   Usability tests on clickable prototype with 6 additional users to catch any major UX and functionality issues and gather qualitative insights about the new design  on clickable prototype with 6 additional users to catch any major UX and functionality issues and gather qualitative insights about the new design A B test with 5  of anonymous users to measure usage data  to measure usage data A B test with 10  of registered users with less than 500 reputation to measure usage data  with less than 500 reputation to measure usage data Opt in for all Stack Overflow employees  Opt in for all users for Meta feedback and for debugging  Our findings from each   Usability Tests  These tests were conducted in 1 1 recorded hangouts with 6 users who ranged from having low to high reputation   While a few participants struggled with identifying two of the icons  which were updated mid testing   all participants successfully completed all tasks  and all participants prefered the new design over the current    Looks really  really good  By far I like the new one   in the current one  you don t notice the navigation at all  only the top bar  The  sub  tabs catch my eye before the current navigation    In the old  it is weird to me that the two bars exist separately  This one feels more natural    The new one is cleaner  Less wasted space  Things are more compact on the new one and account info is better grouped  Tabs across the top is preferable because a lot of sites have a similar flow   much prefer the new one    A B Test with 5  of Anonymous Visitors  This test ran from 2016 12 01 to 2017 01 19 for about 2 million users in each A B group  Anonymous visitors account for about 97  of all page views but only 61  of the current navigation clicks   Signups increased by 7   Clicks to Questions increased by 163   Clicks to Jobs increased by 160   an expected 16  increase in overall Jobs traffic   Clicks to Documentation increased by 229   Clicks to Tags increased by 113   Clicks to Users increased by 178   Clicks to Ask Question increased by 33   Searches decreased by 13     Adjustments to the design between the anonymous test and the registered user test were made that resolved this issue and actually improved the number of searches in the next test   While some dropoff often happens after launch due to novelty effect  these increases were large enough to make us think that a good portion of the increases would be sustained after launch  Regardless  we ll continue to measure and monitor the performance of the new top nav   A B Test with 10  of Registered Users with Less than 500 Rep  This test ran from 2017 01 18 to 2017 01 30 for about 100k users in each A B group   Registered user account for about 3  of all page

717,training-dataset/business/750.txt,business,How Elite Agencies Run Project Post MortemsHow Elite Agencies Run Project Post Mortems Disasters happen  Work gets sloppy  projects go over budget  and schedules fall behind  Can a project post mortem help your team recover and regain focus       For the first time in the history of the workplace  it s perfectly acceptable to celebrate mistakes    Fail fast  has transcended the office to become a personal mantra words to live by when you re urging yourself into the unfamiliar and staring down disappointment  it might be a framed poster on your wall right now    However  there s a misunderstood piece of this new ish culture of failure  That failure is some kind of endpoint  It s not  It s never enough to simply dust yourself off after a critical mistake   We shouldn t feel guilty about failure  but we also must remember this   Treating failure as an endpoint gives it too much power   tweet this   Failure is  at its worst  a roadblock  And at a growing business  your team needs to not just crash and burn  but pull themselves from the wreckage of errors and deconstruct the crash so that it never happens again   Similarly  we need to capture our wins so that they aren t remembered as lucky breaks   We need to give a name to absolutely everything that had a notable effect on our projects  good and bad  and let them become the fabric of how we get stuff done  It s only in these trusted processes that our teams can find focus   An amazing way to collect and analyze these peaks and valleys is a project post mortem  In my experience and the experience of some others that you ll hear from below project post mortems are a key part of team management  and a crucial way of honing in on what makes your team click  and what makes them  well  crash   Just what exactly is a project post mortem   Alex Shootman  the CEO of Workfront  told us this of his experience with unsuccessful projects     Every project will encounter at least three disasters along the way  And none of these disasters will be related to the technical  mechanical or procedural tasks at hand  They will all come down to communications    It s true that projects often die at the hands of bad team communication  But when it comes to a project post mortem  team communication can also be the saving grace   While project post mortems can take many forms they are typically formalized at all hands meetings involving all members of a project  That said  they can also involve individual or segmented discussions for larger teams the inner workings of a project post mortem are all about cutting through poor communication practices  and letting your team objectively discuss the outcome of a project   On the surface  it s a discussion about what went well  what went poorly  and how the team can be better  Under the hood  though  it s an opportunity to remind your group that excellent team performance does not happen by accident it s a process that happens in increments  as a collective   Followers of the Agile framework believe so highly in the project post mortem within the community  it s called the much less morbid  retrospective  that it s one of the core principles of the Agile Manifesto   At regular intervals  the team reflects on how to become more effective  then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly    Agile also very vocally values  Responding to change over following a plan  which can be very instructive advice when considering that your team is not a static object  Much is changing in any growing enterprise let alone one caught in the insanity of client work and it s important to be constantly acknowledging change   In all likelihood  your team is too new and half formed to hold ideas too close to heart  So why not make decisions rapidly  based on experience and a desire to continually improve   With all that in mind  we talked to the best in the biz to find out what makes for a perfect post mortem one that ensures that project mistakes of the past stay in the past       1  Record results early and often   Any team that does client work will tell you that a week long project almost never takes a week  Communication slows down  deliverables get rejected  and the perfect schedule proves too ambitious after all  To make matters worse  we rarely raise any flags when it s clear things are starting to drift off schedule  as Knight  Thomas  and Angus pointed out in HBR     Why don t more project managers sound an alarm when they re going to blow past their deadlines  Because most of them have no earthly idea when they ll finish the job  They don t even think it s possible to know  Too many variables  Too much that s out of their control    At this point  the project usually becomes a crawl to the finish line for everyone  project managers included  The collective eagerness to move on mutes out the good and bad parts  and the main takeaway at the end will be  Thank god it s over  Let s move on    To maximize lessons learned  try to engage your team throughout your projects  This ensures that your team  exhausted and eager to move on from a long project  doesn t limp their way through a post mortem   Samuel Wheeler  a project manager at Inseev Interactive  suggests holding regular  Innovation Sessions  to improve processes and operations   In this session  your team can discuss ways that current projects can be improved or changed  It is a great way for the leader of the team to receive feedback and allow the team members to be involved in the operational side of the project  I love to hold these sessions over a beer or some light snacks as it helps to encourage creativity and conversation  I have found that these structured meetings often result in high quality action items that improve every project    By following Samuel s lead  you can not only improve process and outcome throughout a project  but arrive at the post mortem armed with real  live data from your team not just whatever wins and losses remained in the rubble of a project  At your post mortem  open all of your collected findings to the team  and see what still resonates   2  Emphasize team performance  and kill the witch hunt   The average guilt ridden person likely feels that any unsuccessful project is their fault or that a very successful project was due in no part to their contributions   Worse still  the people who are really at fault may come into a project post mortem eager to shift the blame elsewhere   Dev would have been on schedule if design hadn t dragged their feet     It may seem like the best path to open up the floor to everyone but if you open it up to the blamers  you ll have a poisonous post mortem on your hands   The problem to solve here   How can we remove the idea that anyone stands to lose anything personally by attending a project post mortem  The answer may lie in emphasizing that this is about improving team performance  not supercharging the loudest individuals in the room   While transforming a group of individuals into a team involves some serious alchemy and is not an easily solved problem itself  Linda Hill and Kent Lineback summed up what makes a team quite beautifully over at HBR   The powerful ties among members of this social structure spring  first  from purpose and goals  A common  worthwhile purpose creates a sense of doing something important together  and specific  challenging team goals based on that purpose create a sense of going someplace important together  Without purpose and goals  no group will become a team    Knowing this  it s valuable to ensure that your team understands the reasoning for a project post mortem goes beyond  I guess we screwed up  and our boss is mad    Successful project post mortems bring critical reflection into a safe space   tweet this   Giving your team and company a clear purpose can help them think past the next project  and towards the bright future  Dependably smooth projects  then  simply become a means to achieving this shared goal   Yes  your team is trying to keep clients happy and do terrific work  But what s it all for       3  Record  recognize  and reward victories   A key outcome of any project post mortem isn t just a small process improvement it s a leap forward in your team s motivation to go out and crush the next big project  And as much as your laundry list of criticisms may feel like the true path to successful projects  motivation lies on highlighting wins   Over on the Portent blog  Kyle Eliason writes about how mindset plays into the dynamics of the reflective team   It s important that your team is in the right mindset  positive and learning focused  not defensive or hypercritical   Generally  the more powerful or proud they feel  the more effectively they can process constructive criticism    Think of it this way  Do you want to storm into a project post mortem looking sullen and ready to explode  or do you want to cruise in with an air of optimism  Do you want the first words out of your mouth to be  We made some critical mistakes  and we re lucky we got out of this alive   or  We retained a major client  and shipped an unbelievable website    The former in each example may rub your feared leader ego the right way  but the latter gives your team a major cushion when they re taken aback by critique  If the lede reads that the project had some big wins  the realities of failure and criticism will be far easier to stomach   A team whose victories are often highlighted but especially in a project post mortem may surprise you with how far they re willing to go for the sake of the company  as Katherine Kostereva of bpm online told us     Never underestimate the role of motivation in a project s success  Such recognition will pay off immediately as your team will feel their work is important and valued  A highly motivated and engaged team will always be ready to go the extra mile to ensure the project s success    4  Be transparent with your clients   If all goes well  you and your team will leave the project post mortem with a list of improvements and in all likelihood  a good idea of how your team could have given the client or customer a smoother experience with the company  Your instinct here may be to quietly work these findings into your process for the next project  and let your client be amazed by how much better things felt on the second  third  fourth  or fifth go around     But is not owning up to those mistakes really the right way to go   Many client services companies sell their services as a  partnership   They say that they re equally as invested in the outcome as the client  Why shouldn t a project post mortem acknowledge that and let the client in the loop  Hell  maybe the client has a part to play in the outcome of a less than successful project  too   Keith Shields  partner at Designli  offers this advice on the sometimes adversarial relationship between clients and agencies   Professional Service companies should not be an unknown  black box  where clients put projects and they pop out a certain amount of time later completed  Be transparent with your process  and this will reduce your client phone calls by 20  right away    By removing the client from the feedback loop  you become nothing more than another black box an impersonal place your client comes when they need something   Give the client a chance to care about your team and how they get things done  and you might be amazed by their enthusiasm  Conversely  you might be amazed by how little they care  In both cases  you ll be treated to a keen sense of whether they re a fit for your agency going forward   Sharing these results with your client can take the form of a simple email  a report  or an in person meeting  However it s done  it shows that you care about their opinion  their money  and maybe most importantly  their trust   Trust  after all  is what business is all about  although we don t talk about it that often  Clients entrust us with their money  Customers entrust us with their data  And employees entrust us with their careers   Running better projects and showing continual improvement across the board is a tiny way of communicating to everyone involved  Yes  I have your trust  and yes  it s important to me        Illustrations  Bully,"[717 510 67 387

785,training-dataset/business/1381.txt,business,4 salary negotiation mistakes you ve probably madeFour years ago  I was making  25 per hour as a freelance digital designer building ecommerce sites  I had no idea how to increase my hourly rate  even if I d wanted to   Today  I work as a UX contractor for multi million dollar ecommerce companies  I made the transition from a digital design generalist to a specialist in the research and design of ecommerce purchase paths  By becoming a UX expert  I increased my earnings by 150    I know what some of you are thinking   I don t make  500 in a week   So how can I command similar day rates   Related  How to nail a design job interview  I could have made the transition much faster had I known the secret formula high performing UX executives use to get the salaries they want  I want to share the method with you so you can avoid the mistakes I made and  ask for more  with confidence   Let s dive right in   Negotiation mistake  1  Going in cheap  Up until recently  I didn t know what my skill set was worth  Consequently during the biggest UX interview of my life the one that would allow me to get more valuable work from then on the hiring manager asked me  So Louise  what s your UX design day rate    I said the lowest day rate I could think of and they said  yes  to my offer the next day   Why did I do that   I didn t want to offend anyone I desperately didn t want to lose the job I thought they would give it to someone else if I was  too expensive   Why was this a mistake   Weeks later I overheard a conversation between a hiring manager and team lead in the office kitchen   You know  if you get UX designers on the cheap  they must be desperate    That comment nearly made me choke on my coffee because I hadn t negotiated my day rate during my interview   According to Linda Babcock of Carnegie Mellon University  by not negotiating salary at the beginning of your career  you re leaving anywhere between  1 million and  1 5 million on the table in lost earnings over your lifetime   And that figure doesn t include company retirement contributions based on a percentage of salary   Here are 3 scripts you could use to negotiate a higher than the low rate when confronted with a stressful question about salary    I d love to give you a figure  but I was wondering if you d be able to share your budget for this role  I don t want to go in too high and I would love to get to a figure that would work for both of us    According to my research  a day rate for a role like this is anywhere between  350 a day and  1 200 a day  Because of my experience in ecommerce UX I d be looking for the higher end of that scale   Then share examples of why the top rate is best for you   I d love to understand what success looks like on a project like this  A clear mission will give me an idea of a rate that would work for both of us    Negotiation mistake  2  Undervaluing your skill set  Most people go blindly from UX job to UX job without ever knowing what value and achievements they bring to a role  When you do that  your earning potential flatlines   When you track your achievements  your success becomes quantifiable  Then  you can use your successes as leverage in your next negotiation process   Here are 3 example of quantifiable achievements that you can use to frame your value to an existing or future employer   Reduced drop off rates of 41  by 20  that resulted in an increase in traffic of 25  through the sales funnel Reduced abandonment rates on registration by 44  that increased revenue by 20  Improved the user flow of invoicing that increased repayment rates by 50  and reduced the number of calls to customer service by 50   Saving the company  10 000 a day in debt collection fees   I challenge you to start keeping tabs on your weekly achievements  When you do this  you can quantify your earning potential to use in salary negotiation to command higher rates   Negotiation mistake  3  Failure to align on employee to employer skill set  A trend I ve noticed over the last few years  digital designers apply blindly for jobs titled  UX UI designer    They think it s a good way into the UX industry  but it isn t  When you work for a company under the  UX UI designer  role  you devalue your earnings by 50  and inadvertently increase your workload by 150    Advertising for a  UX UI designer  is like advertising for a  plumber electrician   Do you want to get hired to do 2 jobs and only be paid for one  Or  worse  you could do a bad job on both roles and risk getting fired   A better idea  apply for a UI designer role or a junior UX role when you re starting out  When you focus on applying for one position  you dramatically increase your chances of getting an interview   Related  8 things to know about building a design portfolio  So why should you focus on applying for only UX design or UI design roles  It seems everyone wants to hire a UX UI designer unicorn   Browse jobs on LinkedIn  and you ll see countless companies looking for a  UX UI designer    On the flipside  here are examples of the types of clearly defined roles that you should be looking for once you ve identified the value you can bring to the role   It pays to focus on getting roles with top tier companies  Why  Think ahead  In 5 years  do you want to have plateaued your career or be surrounded by the most intelligent minds in the industry  When you get your first UX role with a big tech company  you also massively increase your perceived value to future employers   Negotiation mistake  4  Lack of research  Most designers use their last job as a benchmark for salary  When you do that  you risk losing out on salary the company was willing to pay you  if you could prove your value   Here are 3 situations to avoid during negotiation   Going in too high and unintentionally offending the employer Going in too low and shooting yourself in the foot Not being able to justify why you want the higher end of that salary range      So  how do you know what to charge  A quick search on Google for  user experience designer salaries  gives you the following results   The screenshot above shows there s a big gap between  88 365 and  116 025  So during a negotiation  how do you quantify how much you re worth within that range   A few winning script examples you can use to frame your value to get a good deal    In my last role I increased shopping cart values by 300  an extra  55 000 a month in revenue  The reason I m looking for a salary at the high end of  give them the range  is I know you could recoup your investment in me in a short amount of time because of the results achieved in my previous role that I could also bring to this one   The research conducted in my role saved the company  25 000 and because of that  I know you save a considerable amount and more in the future that would allow you recoup your investment in me  in a short amount of time  This script is taken from Lean In  If you re going to be managing people  you could include    I don t know how typical it is for people at my level to negotiate  but I m hopeful that you ll see my skill at negotiating as something important that I can bring to the job   This script  in particular  performed well during negotiating research   When you know your worth  it makes it easier for you to navigate the stress of negotiation and avoid self sabotage   When you arrive prepared to negotiate   You set the stage for future quantifiable success You receive the remuneration you deserve based on the value you can bring to the company You elevate your status in the eyes of the employer  Finally  here s a list of things you should never say during a salary negotiation    No  not really     Possibly  I guess     Honestly  I m worth way more than that     If you don t give me what I want  I ll quit ASAP     No idea     Can you just give me a higher salary     I m worth much more than that     I m sorry to ask you this  but     I was wondering if you could give me a raise    Being able to negotiate a salary is absolutely essential  Next time you re in the situation  take the time to prepare you ll be so glad you did   Looking for more from Louise  Read how she landed her first 5 figure design contract here   You ll love these posts  too,"[785 434 1137 274 75 1167 479 1083 808

808,training-dataset/product/459.txt,product,8 things to know about building a design portfolioTwo years ago  I was finishing my last semester of college and preparing for the seminal moment in a design student s life  portfolio reviews and finding a job  And even though I was finishing a degree in graphic design  I was looking for a full time job as a UX UI designer   My hard work paid off  I landed a job at Bloc  and it s been a magical time   But it was a painful process  I got a lot of rejection emails and made a lot of mistakes  Now that I m building a company that creates new UX designers on a daily basis  I can look back at my old portfolio and pass on those lessons learned  Here are 8 things that I got right and wrong   1  Present your work as a case study  Fill your portfolio with as many case studies as possible   When I applied to jobs in college  I filled my portfolio with big  beautiful visuals  I applied to UX UI jobs left and right  with no luck   Why  What am I doing wrong    I asked a friend for help and she passed along a few portfolios of friends who d gotten hired at top tier companies and   They all had case studies  Rich  wonderful case studies that talked about their design process  their successes and failures  and their ultimate design solutions   I thought  Why couldn t I have case studies   So I added case studies  And  success  My employer response rate jumped   Big beautiful images look great  but they don t tell a hiring manager if you can solve a problem  Can you design a solution that makes your users  clients  and stakeholders happy  Can you talk about your process what solutions you tried  what worked  what didn t  and why  Can you show heaps of work including prototypes  wireframes  scrapped visuals that shows your rigorous problem solving skills   Show that you can solve problems  and you ll show that you re worth hiring   2  Carefully curate your portfolio  Should your portfolio be specialized or general  For design students  this choice is tough  Some educators advise to diversify your portfolio  show a variety of work be it packaging  print  advertising  and web  Others encourage to specialize  You like mobile apps  You want to build mobile apps in the future  Fill your portfolio with mobile apps   If you re still exploring careers  and you re not sure what you d like to do  I say that it s good to show breadth  But if you want to design mobile apps  and only design mobile apps then specialize  specialize  specialize  The majority of work in your portfolio should be that specialty   When I was starting out  I wanted to do UI design  so I applied for UI positions  My portfolio was filled with web or mobile interface design  But here s the secret  my entire body of work over the past three years wasn t all web over half of it was print  But I didn t want a print job  so I omitted it  And I got the job I wanted   3  Showcase real world work  even if it s got problems  In school  I had an excellent internship  I designed beautiful work and my team was thrilled with it  I left my internship proud and pleased  But shortly after  the project fell apart  and my team disbanded partially because of the work I did   Awkward  The work looked great  but the project ultimately failed  Should I put it in my portfolio  even though I d have to talk about it to future employers   I put it in my portfolio   And man  it was awkward  during interviews  I presented a project that I ultimately failed on  But  being honest about failure was an asset  I spoke frankly about how the project succeeded  and how it failed  I talked about what could be better  I showed that I tried  and learned  And that went over well with the designers I spoke with   When a designer interviews you  they don t know what it s like to work with you  until they do work with you  So as a substitute  show that you ve worked with others  This real world experience demonstrates your character it shows that you can work with a team of stakeholders  under tough deadlines and constraints  And if that project has a poor outcome  talking about it is good  You re not ashamed of the un sexy work you ve created  but you re smart to be critical of the outcome   4  Less design exercises  More in depth case studies   Portfolio  1  typography poster  ad for hypothetical product  Reddit redesign   Portfolio  2  ad for hypothetical product  Facebook redesign  concert poster   Portfolio  3  Craigslist redesign  fake mobile app  fake ad campaign   Go through hundreds of portfolios  and it s not that hard to spot class projects   Let me be clear  posters from your first year typography class look cool  But they don t show that you can work independently and solve problems they show that you can follow a prompt  If you choose to showcase design exercises in your portfolio  make sure those exercises involve rigorous problem solving  and make  em case studies   5  Talk about results  I was interviewing for an internship   I completed a design exercise for the firm  and I was explaining my concept to the interviewer  I d designed a flashy  interactive wireframe with tons of features  and as I finished up my sentence  I felt proud and confident   And then the interviewer asked   What goals are you trying to accomplish with this design    I stammered out a reiteration of the prompt they d given me   The interviewer paused  I balked  Needless to say  I didn t get the internship   I love seeing beautiful  entertaining interaction design work  I spend hours drooling over the layouts on Site Inspire  But I know this from my own work  If your design doesn t improve the user s experience  solve the business goals  or whatever outcome you set  it s purely decorative and useless   Talk about results  Get real data if you can  But if you can t and it s hard for student projects interview your users or stakeholders to get a grip on whether or not your design achieves it s outcomes  Always start and end a project with a goal and an outcome   6  Make your portfolio easy to navigate  Today  I have to conduct user interviews  meet with stakeholders  design a sticker  approve a UI change  prototype some concepts for a new feature  and review the last 20 resumes that ve come in   I have to quickly separate the good portfolios from the bad   I have at best 2 minutes per portfolio   I ve seen beautiful  neat  innovative work  I ve seen designers experiment with interesting layouts and wonderful site designs  But if I find myself lost if I can t navigate your site quickly and easily  I m frustrated   Make sure a user can move through your portfolio quickly and with ease  Make sure it s easy to browse on mobile  If the user experience of your portfolio isn t as good as the user experience of your work  it doesn t reflect well on your talent as a designer   And yes make sure your portfolio is online   7  Do your research  and write sincerely  I received an excellent email application from a designer   Sincere  succinct  straight to the point she showed that she had a passion for education  aligned with our mission  and she threw in a dash of humor  to boot   I set up an interview the next day  And in time  she got the job   A hiring manager reads hundreds of cover emails  The majority start with  Dear Hiring Manager    outline the applicant s experience in excessive  flowery speech  and usually end with the candidate being  fully aligned with your mission    Ditch the cover letter  Show you re a passionate  excellent designer through that first email it s much more effective than a template  Talk about problems you ve tackled in the company s industry  Show that you know the company inside and out  Show that you really  truly care   Be brief  but be sincere it shows through in a sea of templates   8  Let your passion show  In my first interview with Bloc  I went on a 10 minute rant about design education  the value of self driven learning  the difficulties of being self taught  growing needs in the design community  new tools I was trying  and I looked up  embarrassed about running my mouth for a few minutes   But  that s passion   The design community changes and grows  Showing that you re passionate about the industry and the company  That really shows good character   Talk about what you re interested in  Get involved in the community  online or in person  Share links  start discussions  write about your field of interest  Contribute  even if you re still learning   And let that passion shine   This

846,training-dataset/product/632.txt,product,3 levels of craft designers should masterWhat does it mean to be a designer in this modern era of Sketch templates  fluid grids  atomic systems  and rapidly prototyped interactions  There seems to be an overwhelming sense of systemization that may feel at once powerful yet humbling   Yet one pervasive quality that defines being a  designer  regardless of tools or rules is  craft  shaping materials with masterful familiarity towards a benchmark of quality  via one s dedication to refining the details so the result is worthy of personal pride and general appreciation   Craft is what makes design a maker s profession  delivering exemplary artifacts and products something tangibly defined with deep attention   Accordingly  when it comes to software design  filled with interactions  interfaces  data formats  and so forth  that craft aspect is vital to the execution of a well formed digital experience including the colors  fonts  alignments  timing and sequence of behaviors  tenor of audio cues  and tone of messages   And a well crafted product conveys quality that can be seen  felt  shared  and paid for with confidence in the brand and its perceived benefits of use   Craft clearly matters   This is why it s important to go deeper to expose various levels of craft a designer  and design leader  brings to the profession  I propose there are 3 levels of craft that are at work in the course of  doing the work  of a professional designer  while engaging with clients and stakeholders to ship a design out  And  in correlation there are multiple kinds of logic subconsciously guiding such craft behind the scenes   Let me explain   Craft level 1  Tradecraft  This is the level of craft we typically associate with design  at the tactical level of executed details for final production  Every element is precisely  carefully shaped with an exacting attention per one s abilities with the tools  potentiality of the material  code  pixels  vectors  etc    and needs of the context at hand  This also aligns to the features and functions of a product in a visceral way what is seen  felt  and experienced  This is the basic existential level of being a designer  truly practicing one s trade with mastery and focus of execution   Underlying tradecraft is a kind of logic that may be phrased as  procedural   as elements are manipulated and delivered with a sequenced sense for what needs to happen  a precise order of operations to produce and deliver a design   We know but outsiders may not realize that  pixel pushing  is far more than some monotonous  mindless task  It is a tuned dialogue among the the designer s eye  hand  and tools  with an intuitive cadence of feedback and iteration that is quite focused and disciplined  likely with awesome music flowing through some amazing headphones   Truly  a procedure must be followed when you re grinding it out   Craft level 2  Stagecraft  However  detailing out the finer pixel and code based nuances of a digital artifact are only one part of a designer s craft albeit the most visible noticed   Such artifacts  as beautifully executed as they may be  are useless unless there s a compelling story that evocatively enshrines them in a meaningful way to the stakeholders and especially to the ultimate users so they grasp how it all fits into a theme  a brand philosophy  a manner of living or working   That s right  this involves those vital presentation skills  some performance theater  poetry of mantras and pitches  pulling on emotional levers of the audience  while grounded with a good intent to persuade   Stagecraft ties into the organizational and relationship aspect of designing through the power of inspiration  which connects to an emotional core via storytelling   So  the governing logic is something akin to a  perceptual  logic guiding the relationship of emotive and dramatic elements into a compelling narrative that connects with the audience  clients  stakeholders  etc    per the artifacts being showcased  There s a bit of illusion and theater  with good intentions  of course   to enchant and engage as you personify the story of your design solution and its value to the brand   It s not a strictly step by step procedure  but more of a dance that taps into fickle and latent emotions  shaping the story and reality you want your audience to believe  to persuade them  Think Don Draper  not The Joker   Craft level 3  Statecraft  Yet  to get that beautifully defined  well articulated design actually built and shipped requires nuances of compromise  negotiation  and influence  We know all kinds of devils live in those production details   To deal with them effectively  we must dive into the political pragmatic stuff that s inherent to any product development process because  well  people  Everyone has agendas and egos and strives to defend their position  due to various incentive models or belief structures of an organizational culture  and every designer who wants to be effective must grasp this  school of hard knocks  point   Indeed  success as a designer requires a heavy dose of statecraft  driving relationships with people towards shared aims  with principled debates on risks  tradeoffs  and outcomes  This connects to the organizational and cultural aspects of design overall  and this doesn t have to be icky or backstabby at all   Done well  statecraft can lead everyone towards a pursuit of purpose and value embodied in a design direction that should emerge sometimes painfully  in those tough negotiations   Guiding this is what might be termed as a  rhetorical  kind of logic  not in the sense of empty speechifying but in the Classical sense of back and forth discourse to understand  guide  and develop shared points of view   This requires a deep sense for human nature  how  people  are truly  pro tip  read up on your Shakespeare or Mark Twain  true observers of human nature   so you can achieve your aims while addressing their concerns or wishes   Does this sound a bit sneaky  It shouldn t be at all  because negotiating and compromising are how we interact as professionals in all walks of life  from the post office to the doctor s office  Building relationships is the only key to getting your design built the way you want it  with all the dynamics of craft at the core   Related  4 salary negotiation mistakes you ve probably made  Tradecraft  stagecraft  and statecraft are the levels of craft a designer must master in an ongoing journey in their career   They aren t necessarily sequential  either  Just like any design process  mastering craft can be messy and demand iterative repeat attempts  flexing different types of logic muscles in various ways  with some parallel processing  too  For example  imagine applying statecraft to a business team to provide air cover for a new idea s development  while guiding a staff of designers with the storytelling and tactical execution   But at least knowing about these levels of craft and logic can help a designer bring a more informed approach to their design work   Don t miss Uday s

867,training-dataset/product/472.txt,product,Difficult design questions to ask your new clientCongratulations you ve won the pitch and got the job  As a designer  though  the hard work has just begun   Whether you re a freelancer or working at an agency  it s not always easy to ensure you get the information you need from a client  You may feel like you re going blind into a large company with a set culture  and defined identity and values   Still  initiating contact and getting the right preliminary information from your client prior to starting work is vital  The information you gather will set the tone for the rest of the project and help in putting together an accurate quote  timeframe  and working schedule   It s easy to shy away from asking vital tough questions early in the process when you re working for yourself  If you want to set up a successful client relationship  however  you need to ask these questions   How are you different   What sets your client apart from the thousands of other people who offer the same thing   Push for a solid answer here so you can better understand their culture and how they re different in the services or product they provide  their office space  or their approach to work   From there  think about how to reflect that in their design   Why do you want a new brand logo identity website   Make sure any potential client is starting this process for the right reasons  Ask them what exactly they want to change and why   If it turns out they re looking for a quick fix or a rapid increase in short term business  it may be wise to question whether they re looking as far into the future as they need to   What do you think this project will improve   Though a new design might look better  what exactly will it improve  Your client might be sending the wrong message if you rebrand or change their visual identity too strongly  and these updates will have to be justified   As a designer  the last thing you want is to have your site design bear the weight of bottom line business performance  There are of course strong cases for how refreshing a brand identity will improve the marketing  direction  and profits of company  but ensure they are well thought out and solid   Before working with a client  make sure they have a clear vision of how a new brand or look and feel will improve the company or will at least let you help them find that vision   How much do you have to spend   Don t avoid the ever pressing issue of budget and spend  Address this early and come to grips with how much your client has budgeted for the project  Ask for specifics  and don t make any assumptions   This is especially true with first time clients  before a working relationship has been developed  If nothing else  it will give you a good idea of the scope of the project  and how much you will be able to deliver within their budget and associated timeframe   What are your long term goals   This ties into the previous questions about timing for the project  and why your client seeks a brand refresh or digital print rebranding   Ask about long term goals  These form the backbone of a company  especially a small one  so probe into what they re looking to achieve in the future  Also be sure to ask about existing designs  other current design projects  and anything else you should be aware of before you begin  Most companies will have existing structures you might need to work around or within   The work you do for them may be around for a while make sure it fits into their plans and won t become outdated fast   What s the timeline for this project   A very clear idea of a project timeline needs to be established so everyone knows what to expect when  It s easy to get going on the work  get excited by the idea  and get caught up in the creative only for the client to say they were expecting it far earlier than you were expecting   Make goals  targets  and deadlines and stick to them  Also be realistic about how much can be achieved within a certain timeframe and make sure these are communicated   Ask honest questions about what your client wants done and give honest answers about your capacity and abilities   Who are the key stakeholders decision makers   This may not be a difficult question  but it s an important one  The answer to this needs to be pinned down as early as possible   You need to be speaking to the right people as in  the ones who can sign off your work   We all know work can often be held up throughout the review  feedback  and sign off process  This can get even worse if you realize down the line you ve talked to people with no real power to say  yes  or  no  to your designs  Many people within an organization will have creative opinions on your work  but it s vital that the main decision maker is happy with it   Who needs to see your work before it s good to go  Identify the real decision makers      Questions and attempting to find the answers are a huge part of the job we do when we re creating or refreshing a brand identity for a client   In the best case scenario  you ve asked and answered the right questions about potential clients before you ever sign on the dotted line  If not  ask these vital questions as early as possible in the process to save yourself potential headaches later   Consider this  getting to know your client phase  to be the crucial first part of your design process,"[867 434 387 67 271 604 717 1079 280 461 1322]"
873,training-dataset/product/1424.txt,product,Lyft s Monal Chokshi on lightweight user researchMonal  My graduate degree was in Cognitive Science with a concentration in Human Computer Interaction  I went to UCSD because there were some research labs focused on using ethnographic research methodology to understand users in real world situations and how their social and cultural environment shape their behaviors  I d had a little bit of experience doing field research  was really interested in it and thought it was a very impactful way to learn about users and then apply that to design  In fact  my master s thesis was funded by Nissan and I was doing ethnography of drivers and cars  so now I ve come full circle   Monal  It definitely prepared me for that  In fact  I did an internship while I was in undergraduate at Boeing and I was working at usability labs  That was my first experience getting to do some user testing and research  I entered the workforce full time with that experience and those thoughts in mind   Jillian  Do you feel like your undergrad career also prepared you for research or did you get more into you once you were in the field   When I started working in the late 90s  it was right in the middle of the Dot com era  I was what today you might call a UX generalist  so I was doing everything from user research to product design and even some front end coding  At that time  there was no term like UX or user experience  It s very early and folks wore a lot of hats  especially at the startups I was working at  After working at a few startups I realized that my true passion was understanding more about the users and their needs in order to inform really good design  so I decided to go back to graduate school at UC San Diego in order to focus solely on moving forward with UX research   Monal Chokshi  Lyft is the fastest growing on demand transportation service in the US  and I feel pretty lucky to have had the career path that I ve had leading me here  I found my passion for UX research pretty early  when I was at Stanford in the mid 90s  I did my undergraduate degree in symbolic systems  which is an interdisciplinary major consisting of classes from computer science  philosophy  psychology and linguistics  My concentration was in human computer interaction   Jillian Wells  Monal  welcome to the show  Could you tell us a little bit about your career in research and what you re doing these days at Lyft   If you like what you hear check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed   What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the interview  but if you re short on time  here are five key takeaways   Monal joined me on our podcast to share how researchers can prove their value  the way she s structured her own research teams and why lightweight  guerrilla research   an exercise she likens to dating   is the user research gateway drug for startups   Monal Chokshi  Head of UX Research at Lyft  has spent her career helping tech companies establish a user research culture and get closer to the people hiring their product   She joined Lyft in 2015 as its very first researcher and was tasked with building and leading their research department   something she d previously done successfully at SoundCloud and Intuit   Your product starts and ends with your users  They re at the core of all aspects of your business  from deciding what small feature updates you should build to a new product s marketing agenda   Jillian  What was the state of research when you arrived at Lyft   Monal  I was hired as the first official researcher at Lyft about two years ago  The company  by then  was very very hungry for insights  Lyft didn t have researchers on board from the start  but they ve always invested in some kind of formal studies and lightweight research along the way   I love telling this story because it s really indicative of like the culture at Lyft and what our founders care about  In the early days  the entire Lyft team including our founders  Logan and John  would respond to customer support tickets aiming to better understand and address our users  needs and pain points  They also did  and continue to do  guerrilla research like observing and chatting with Lyft drivers in their cars to better understand how Lyft is doing and how well the product is working for them as they drive  In fact  they re both Lyft drivers themselves to stay in touch with the driver s perspective   Jillian  How has research at Lyft changed since you ve arrived   Monal  Since I was the first researcher there  I was building things from scratch  similar to when I was at SoundCloud  There was definitely a need and a desire from the get go to do user testing  Lyft was a few hundred people at the time  and I worked as part of the design team  My first goal was to setup an ongoing user testing program  and I was lucky enough to have another team member join  We worked together to get that going but we ended up doing a lot of tactical research in the very beginning  It was a lot of   Hey  let s prove what we ve got going on  Let s make a name for research  show our value and work closely with the design team    Once we proved our value we were able to hire more folks and start bringing in more strategic initiatives  answering bigger  more challenging questions  We were really trying to fill some of the foundational gaps we had early on  but it s a balance of what you use your time for and building the value that the company needs immediately  then coming back and showing them more of what you can do and the value of that as well  The team continues to grow when people see what you can do   Embracing guerrilla research  Jillian  You mentioned guerrilla research  which is something you gave a recent talk about at Mind the Product s Product Tank  What s your definition of guerrilla research   Monal  Guerrilla research is a way to get impromptu and informal feedback from users  Most often  this entails quick and dirty user testing of your product or a prototype with easily accessible folks  This is more than just showing them some screens and asking if they like it  It s about observing their use of it and learning where they struggle   Jillian  When is it most useful   Monal  Most researchers would be remiss to call guerrilla a real form of research  It has a spur of the moment nature and doesn t really allow for us to control for the factors that are necessary when conducting real research  Relying solely in guerrilla research is risky because we can t really use it to make reliable business or product decisions  That all said  guerrilla research is really just a lightweight way to get feedback  and it s best for teams who are not doing any research at all or who are not talking to their users   I recall a meeting with the PM and a designer at SoundCloud who d been debating the design of a new feature  When I found out that their debate had been going on for days  I said   Let s just go out there and see how people are reacting to it   so we went out to a local coffee shop to do some quick and dirty guerrilla research   I see guerrilla research as being a gateway drug to real user research   We were able to quickly test a prototype of a feature with a handful of users and it was really eye opening experience for both the designer and the product manager who had really not done any kind of research before  Much to their surprise  that issue they were debating was not even on the table for these users  A quick round of testing revealed an entirely different issue to consider  and they immediately started taking this new perspective into account  As a result  they saw the value of getting feedback from users  became user research converts and kept asking me to lead more research   I see guerrilla research as being a gateway drug to real user research  I ve seen many folks start to understand the value of interacting with users in this way and then want to invest in having user research on board to do real research   Jillian  You have a really nice metaphor for guerrilla research and the fact that many of us have already used the principles behind it   our dating lives  Walk me through this   Monal  I have an outgoing personality  but it s always a bit nerve racking when you randomly approach someone you don t know to participate in research  It s that same kind of feeling when you go out to talk to a stranger in a bar or for dating purposes   There are five key principles that can be applied to guerrilla research as well as your dating life   1  Choose your target audience  We do this in our dating lives already  We may look to meet folks who share similar interests or hobbies  Let s say I m a rock climber  I might meet someone who I m really excited to talk to and possibly date at the climbing gym  We know who we want to date  potentially  and we know where to find them  Similar with guerrilla research   you need to know who your product s target audience is and figure out where to easily access them  You cannot get worthwhile feedback unless you re talking to the right audience   2  Let them do the talking  Going back to guerrilla research  you ve met the person that you want to target and they ve agreed to participate in a testing session  When you re getting feedback from your product  your main goal is to listen and to encourage your users to keep talking  You want to ask open ended questions such as   Why   or  Tell me more about that   You want to encourage them to keep talking so that you can learn what they are thinking while they re doing the task you ve given them with your product  Similarly with dating  it s always a good tactic to show genuine interest in someone by asking questions and actively listening  You want to let them do the talking   3  Don t ask leading questions  These could bias a user into answering a question in a certain way  which you don t want for research  For example  asking   Isn t this feature useful   may lead users to agree with you rather than come up with their own impression  The better question in that case would be   What do you think of this feature   With dating let s say you meet someone  You might not want to assume anything about them or what they re interested in  Instead of asking leading question about what their interests are  it might be best to leave it open ended and ask   What kinds of things do you like to do    4  Pay close attention to what they do  People often say one thing but do another  so even if users say   I think this product is great  It s so easy to use   you may have observed some pitfalls they encountered or you might have noticed some confused facial expressions they had as they were using the product  You re still getting to see where they had issues and trouble  Now with dating  your body language can play a huge part in understanding the difference between what people are saying and what they re actually doing  They might intend a cold shoulder  but they don t want to be mean so they might say something nice  Reading body language is a very important   5  Show appreciation  Buying someone a coffee cannot only entice them to participate in your guerrilla session  but it s also a great way to show that you valued their time and feedback  When dating  of course  it s always respectable to thank someone for a great night out   Building a UX research team  Jillian  You ve built out the research teams at Lyft and previously at SoundCloud  There are a lot of different paths into this field  What do you look for in a researcher   Monal  There are definitely many paths  and it s one of the things I love about our field  We have people entering from so many different perspectives and it creates a really nice diversity   There s lots of traits that are important to me when considering who to hire  Obviously  it s great to have people who have experience with UX research already  but we always look to bring on folks who are more junior and to help them grow as well  I look for three key qualities when considering a candidate   The first is their ability to empathize with others  As a user researcher  being empathetic is at the core of what we do  We need to be good  active listeners and feel comfortable when trying to truly understand other s perspectives  Without being able to do that  it s really hard to collect good data   Being empathetic  is at the core of what we do   Then the second quality is analytical thinking  It s a key component of being able to turn the data that you collect into insights and then recommendations  so having a nice way to point the data that got you to get to the recommendation is really key for teams to buy in to those insights   Finally  and this might be overlooked  but project management skills are key to the success of a researcher  We re often managing several things at once  sometimes for several studies  But for every study  we need to manage stakeholders  participants and facilities  and of course all the data needs to be super organized in order for you to be able to find your way through the masses  It s important that researchers are able to manage their time well  stay organized and really have an eye for detail   Jillian  How have you gone about structuring your team   Monal  We started out with more of a service model because we were so small  Now  I m moving towards a model where there are dedicated researchers for each of what we call our pods  We have passenger facing products  driver facing products  enterprise products and products for autonomous vehicles  We have dedicated researchers now for each one of these four pods  My goal is to empower each of the researchers who are working in these pods to be able to become the expert for that product area  They ll know everything they need to about that user  They re the expert on the set of users who are using those products  and they can really speak to the user needs  the product opportunities and the design that is required to enable those users to be happy and enjoy the experience   Jillian  Do you all come together to share that knowledge  so all the researchers are exposed to the same level of insights   Monal  Definitely  We also have a couple of other research teams beyond UX research  We have a brand and consumer insights team   they do a lot of work with our marketing organization  Then we have policy researchers who work in our government relations team  We have a few different pods of research across the company  I hold a monthly meeting for all of the researchers so we re able to collaborate  exchange ideas and ensure that we re not duplicating efforts  At past companies I ve seen that happen  where you have a market researcher and a UX researcher who are trying to tackle very similar questions and almost doing the same study  As the first researcher  I was in this luxurious position to make sure that doesn t happen   It s been really nice to have this community  and you get to hear what s going on all across the company as well  We re there for each other and there to collaborate as well  Just the UX research team  we meet weekly  We all sit together so it s very easy for us to collaborate   Jillian  As the head of research  are you still regularly interfacing with customers   Monal  In the beginning I was in the trenches  I was doing it all  As the team has grown  I ve moved further and further away from being able to do the hands on research  It s very empowering to be able to work towards having research influence the organization  but I do miss the hands on research and the ability to be out in the field and run sessions  However  I do get some exposure to that through my team  so I will mentor folks and sometimes run a study together with someone  I m sure as we continue to grow those opportunities won t be as often  but I do really like to get in there whenever I can   Research in a dual sided market  Jillian  Lyft is a dual sided marketplace   your users are both drivers and riders  What challenges does that present to your team   Monal  The drivers and passengers are very different users with very different jobs to do  so we look at each of them very differently and consider them separately when mapping their user journeys  What s really interesting to me is that this is a dual sided marketplace  but it s not just digital  the two sets of users actually intersect in the real world at some point along the journey  The user experience converges inside of a contained vehicle  which is moving from one physical space to another  It s really like interesting   We recently did a study with our new amp  For those who know Lyft  it s the new glowstache   a lighted device on the driver s dashboard  The color matches the color on the passenger s app so that drivers and passengers can more easily find each other  There s a whole setup process for drivers  and we wanted to really understand how well it was working for passengers  so we decided to do a user testing study with both drivers and passengers simultaneously,"[873 1259 1322 1230 1388 1137 188 461 531 75 891]"
891,training-dataset/product/1044.txt,product,The simple guide to product testingAt Five and Shoutem  this is what we tell every single user during our in person testing sessions   I want to start by saying that we re testing  the product   and not you  You can t do or say anything wrong  and nothing is going to hurt our feelings   And we mean it  We re not actually testing the user  right  We re testing the product  regardless of the stage it s in  from a concept to a healthy  released product   When we re in the very beginning of a new project and validating a product idea through testing  we re miles away from proper usability testing  which we do later in the project   This is just one of the reasons we don t refer to these sessions as usability testing or user testing we instead call it product testing   These guidelines aren t just for teams already building products  They re also for anyone who s just starting to think about new product ideas and ways to validate them   While there are multiple things to keep in mind when planning and conducting a product testing  here s a simple list that can help you focus   Start testing the very first week of the project Do more than  just  usability testing 5 users per target group Do it more than once Take care of the details  1  Start testing the very first week of the project  As an agency  we start new projects with a short discovery research phase followed by a design sprint  Sprints are great when kicking off new initiatives  testing new product ideas and features  etc  We end the workshop by creating a medium fidelity prototype  a rapid process for us with tools like Sketch and InVision  that we then test with users  We want to validate the direction we re heading right at the start   Can you imagine how rewarding that is  There was almost nothing a couple a days ago now there s a concept  a business case  and actual feedback from real customers   What a great way to start a project   2  Do more than  just  usability testing  Priorities in testing sessions change as a project evolves  We might start out really heavy on validating the product idea and prioritizing features  but as we progress  we may focus less on that and more of how things come together   Let s discover how the testing focus shifts throughout the project   Concept  Validate the product idea with the desired target audience Features  Prioritize features  especially when building an MVP  Information architecture  Test out different approaches to information architecture User flow  How proposed flows affect the user experience and behavior Visual design  A series of tests related to visual design  voice and tone  readability  branding  naming  micro copy  etc   3  5 users per target group  You ve heard this a million times  5 participants in a testing session is enough to get the majority  cca 85   of the feedback you need at that point   What s important to note is that s actually 5 users per a target group  meaning if you have primary and secondary type of users  you need to multiply that number   Identify people who match your demographics  or even better  match your personas and then screen for behavioral traits  attitudes  and goals that match those of your users    Nielsen Norman Group  We tend to always have 6 humans recruited  plus floaters available for morning and afternoon sessions   The tendency to do more than 5 comes from experience sometimes users who show up aren t a good match  sometimes there are equipment issues  or there s a fire drill  it s happened more than once     4  Do it more than once  A very important thing for the entire team to realize is that early concept testing is by no means enough  Even though a project is underway  there should still be regular testing sessions as the designs get more fidelity  longer flows  richer features  as the final UX prototype has been created  as we jump into development   The most important thing is to guide those tests towards a desired outcome  For example  in testing the product in the visual design phase  it s important for the tests  assumptions  and goals to focus on items directly related to this phase  While I m positive you ll encounter feedback related to other things than what you intended to test  everything from product fit to the actual user experience   capture that feedback and pencil it into the product roadmap   5  Take care of the details  As always in life  the details are not the details  We ve seen completely different testing results when one or more details weren t executed with care  It s important to keep the story we re telling to users alive and not to break the flow  Users need to stay in the shoes we ve asked them to put on   Use real content in your prototype  These users were sourced because they are the target audience  For instance  they frequently order food on mobile  they have previously learned Spanish  etc  They will definitely look at content in your prototype and sometimes be blocked by an easily solvable gap or error  Know thy flow  You re effectively guiding the user through a path without them knowing where they are in the flow  e g  how many steps or screens are left   You need to guide them  and more importantly  you need to have a mental map of the flow in your head if something goes unplanned  as it often does   It s always important to know what s the primary focus on each screen so that the study goals can be properly validated  Know your hardware  Set yourself up for success and don t let  typical  hardware behaviors get in the way  I m talking about screensavers  brightness levels  notifications  other apps  etc  Know your software  Prototyping tools and behind the scenes interactions can sometimes conflict with intended actions for our users  An example  Swiping on mobile is  obviously  intuitive for users  even though a prototyping software might interpret this as  navigate to next screen  rather than interacting with the screen the desired way  Although you envisioned the study user flow in one way  this one simple  feature  can disrupt the organic navigation through the screens  Bare that in mind when creating the ideal setup  If you re using InVision  you can work around this by disabling the  Explore All Screens  feature   At the end of the day  The most striking truth of the curve is that zero users give zero insights   If you re doing product design  you should do product testing  We hope this guide helps you in this process,"[891 188 231 1322 145 341 1388 1259 618 543 75]"

972,training-dataset/product/1376.txt,product,Design to code  Lessons for a unicorn workflowDesign is a process  It involves many people of many skill sets  across many locations  being thrown many curveballs  and using many programs always accompanied by the endless  inevitable ticking of the project clock   At For The People  we re constantly experimenting with tools and programs in an attempt to find the unicorn workflow that allows our developers  strategists  writers  and designers to work together  It s crucial to have a flow that works for your whole team  not just some or even most individuals   Related  Try out Inspect  your team s faster way to certainty  To help scratch our own workflow itch  we recently reimagined and redesigned Streamtime  a project management solution for businesses and teams in the creative industry  and now  for anyone   The project required a detailed understanding of user needs and behavior  how to plan and execute integrations with products like Xero  and how to work hand in hand with a development team   In short  it was the perfect project to help us find our unicorn an effective design to developer workflow  As we conceived and built the Streamtime tool  we learned some valuable lessons about designer and developer workflows   Lesson 1  Get on the same page from the start  We kicked off the project with a good ol  fashioned Post it session  In Post it Land  everything is pink and the future looks bright  Everyone speaks the same language of doodles and words  The problem  Vague planning can inspire a false sense of forward momentum   Things got hairier when it came time to turn doodles and guiding ideas into designs   Streamtime is for creatives  so make it fun   looks great on a Post it  but if there isn t room in your workflow to turn ideas  hypotheses  and assumptions into real user insights and then concrete designs  you re going to feel the pain and suffering of a vague  poorly built foundation and fast   Lesson 2  Adapt personal work habits to help the team  With the broad range of skill sets in the office  everyone wanted to work with what they re used to  even if it didn t fit the bill  For instance  I complicated my life by stubbornly working with Illustrator  It s a great program for many things  but designing for digital platforms is not its forte   We had a large team of people involved  working around the clock from 3 different locations  Our first attempt at a workflow spanned too many programs  making it slow and inefficient  Filetypes  file sharing  uploading  exporting  downloading all of it was costing us a lot of time   Everyone on your team should be on the same workflow  even if this means having to adapt to new ones   Lesson 3  Swipe right for the right app combo  Stick with a flow of programs that works for your team  even if this means going through a bunch to find the right combo  As Tinder has taught us  finding the perfect match isn t easy  The more ambitious your design goals  the more willing you must be to experiment with the right mix of tools to get the job done   Use a minimum viable combination of programs  This means using the minimum amount of programs needed to achieve this goal  When it comes to programs  more isn t merrier   For us at For the People  the InVision Sketch Slack combo has become almost a guaranteed stack foundation for any product we work on  Sketch is a feisty alternative to Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop  InVision is good for initial prototypes as well as a final bridge between design and code  We use InVision as a platform to share the latest designs  where non designers could see the product unfold before their eyes and add specific comments exactly where needed   Related  Learn how to switch to Sketch  For projects requiring more specialized tools  we ll add to that foundational stack as needed  always striving to keep it as simple as possible   Lesson 4  Maintain tidiness and consistency  Treat your workflow and all the programs as if they were a physical space  Clutter can be your worst enemy  Resolved issues and comments should be archived every once in a while  Get in the habit of doing it before it s too late  If you re not organized properly  you re probably losing time on your design process   Lesson 5  Keep it real with design context  Another strength of this flow is it shows design in context  giving us a better sense of the experience we re looking to create  Prototyping tools will never completely replace an actual coded experience  but it helps to remove any leap of faith that normally exists between flat designs and the vision in your head which otherwise can get lost in translation when showing others  For that  InVision works a dream and makes my job as a designer much easier   Following these lessons in our flow  we ve taken Streamtime to 1 0  We re working toward banishing the traditional way of recording time  helping creatives plan their own workflow and day to day tasks better  We ve built the product at the front of our stack Streamtime for planning to help us get on  and stay on  the same page   A common misunderstanding equates creativity and design with a lack of process  We have a mental image of creativity being random  when the reality is  to build the best products  it requires a team pushing toward the same goal   Design requires a workflow to cut through the clutter and enable everyone excel within their skill set  Sure  there are compromises and adjustments to be made  but once you find a program stack and workflow that really works  embrace it and continuously improve,"[972 1137 543 573 555 717 145 387 1388 1291 1094]"
1000,training-dataset/product/693.txt,product,Moderating the Back RoomModerating the Back Room A strategic tool for experience researchers   It was the end of a long day of usability sessions  We were at a facility and peanut butter cup wrappers and notes on yellow pads cluttered the room  We all agreed it had been a productive day of research  We had learned a lot  I waved goodbye to the designers and told them I d be working on the research report while they cranked out a few preliminary designs based on the feedback   About a week later when we first prepped for our client meeting  I realized my worst fear as a researcher had come true  Where I had seen major foundational issues within our design strategy  the designers had seen validation in the approach  They had come away with completely different findings than I had  It was then that I became a passionate activist for the back room  While logistically it may be a viewing station  the back room can be an important tool for uniting stakeholders and ensuring impactful research   The back room is where the story is first told  Many qualitative studies have a  back room   The most obvious and common goal of this room is to give stakeholders a chance to observe the research  Maybe it s an empty conference room with live streaming from a laptop or maybe it s in a facility with stadium seating and a one way mirror  Whether the researcher actively moderates the observers or not  the back room is where the story is first told  To successfully moderate the back room is to create a space where stakeholders not only view the research but also become a part of its analysis   While logistically it may be a viewing station  the back room can be an important tool for uniting stakeholders and ensuring impactful research   When the researcher fails to moderate interpretations  stakeholders may latch onto a single observation that is unrepresentative of overall findings  they may start working on designs that don t align with the research  they may be surprised by the final research results  and the researcher may miss out on rich and varied perspectives that could help shape findings and recommendations  It is the researcher s job to ensure all interested parties are on the same page and prevent misalignment with any observations and findings   Align stakeholders with findings as early as possible  The key to unifying research findings with stakeholder interpretations is to convert the back room into an ongoing synthesis venue  To do so  here are a few tips   Create a back room  If you don t have access to an official observation room  have no fear  A back room can be as simple as an empty conference room or even a table where observers congregate  All you need is a dedicated space and the ability to view the research  e g  streaming from a laptop    Invite your stakeholders to attend in person  Although some circumstances call for remote viewing  there is no better way to unite over findings than being together in the same room  It may be difficult to convince overbooked colleagues to attend in person  but coupling just one session with a mini debrief often leaves stakeholders hungry for more   Start the day by outlining 3 5 main questions  This step is essential  Before the first session starts  define three to five questions that are crucial to answer  Write them where any observer can easily view them  My personal preference is to do this on a whiteboard in a table format  with questions representing columns and participants  names attached to rows  If a white board isn t available  try using a shared document   To successfully moderate the back room is to create a space where stakeholders not only view the research but also become a part of its analysis   Hold a mini debrief after each session  Schedule a solid break between each session  no shorter than 15 minutes  During this time  ask your observers to help answer each of the main questions based on the most recent participant  As the day goes on  each participant s findings will be there for the team to reference  Filling out this table after each session will help to 1  interpret any behavior as an outlier or part of a trend  2  easily catch anyone up on the day s learnings thus far  and 3  serve as an invaluable tool for synthesizing the overall takeaways   Hold an EOD debrief with the team to go through your findings  To ensure that everyone leaves with a single narrative  debrief at the end of the day  I like to send out a separate meeting invitation to the same stakeholders that were invited to observe  Bringing everyone together for a recap not only offers a chance to catch up anyone who missed the sessions  but it also provides an opportunity to hear any observations that you may have missed  And if you re wondering how you will be able to provide a summary so soon  it should be easy   just go through the table you ve been filling in all day   Close the loop early by sending top line notes  In the spirit of communication  email your stakeholders a bulleted list of your summary within 24 hours of your research  As an extra bonus  work with your designers to include recommendations or intended changes if time is sensitive   Every study has a back room  Every study has a back room  even if there is no one in it  Whether it occurs in a car between in home visits  at your desk reading diary entries  or behind a one way mirror observing a focus group  the back room is where the synthesis happens  regardless of methodology  And it is crucial to bring your stakeholders along on this research journey  What are your strategies to moderate the back room  Share them with  Airbnbdesign  I d love to hear more tips,"[1000 1259 873 1337 1322 103 461 573 145 531

1079,training-dataset/product/233.txt,product,6 steps to modern mentorshipFinding a design mentor can be incredibly difficult  Organizations are shifting away from traditional design silos to cross functional teams  eroding design support systems in the process  Certain design leaders in your organization may not be trained in the digital expertise of the current market   And due to the ever changing standards of design  both junior and senior designers are struggling with what to learn next  Senior designers are required to continuously expand their digital tool set  junior designers may be are proficient in more tools  but lack real world practice and leadership qualities to level up   Fortunately  it s easier than ever to connect with talented  experienced professionals  By taking a less formal approach to mentorship  you can speak with mentors across disciplines  industries  and locations  Instead of choosing one person as your long term guide  gather various opinions all at once  and make decisions based on your collective research  You ll receive a wealth of information that will greatly level up your skills  regardless of what the future brings   Step 1  Start with yourself  To prepare for your mentor search  first ask yourself   What kind of person are you now   Do a SWOT analysis to identify your personal   Strengths  Weaknesses  Opportunities  Threats  What comes easy to you  What tasks do you struggle with  What would you like to accomplish  and what will help or hurt your chances   Remember  this is just a way to assess who you are right now  and these characteristics will change over time  Re evaluate yourself throughout your career   If you aren t sure how to answer these questions  ask a colleague you trust to help   What are your goals for the future   Draft a life blueprint to define your ambitions  Or set SMART goals   Specific  Measurable  Achievable  Relevant  Time bound  Spend the necessary time to think about your goals   This is more important than learning the newest tool   If you don t know what you want  it ll be impossible to find a mentor to help you get it   Again  remember that these goals reveal what you want in this phase of your life  Plan to revisit and refine these goals over time   What are you willing to struggle for   Everything you want requires a sacrifice  Trading money for freedom  creativity for security  or free time for more work are all possibilities especially if you re a designer  Decide what you can part with  as well as what you can t  and be honest with yourself  If you aren t willing to make certain sacrifices  you may need to reevaluate and redefine your goals   Step 2  Find your mentors  Mentorship doesn t have to be a formal agreement between you and a senior person you can learn something from everyone  Think about people you respect who are already in your life  current and past colleagues  friends and their spouses  and family members  What traits do you respect in each of them  Who has steadily progressed in their careers   Expand your search and review friends of friends on LinkedIn  Read the bios of upcoming speakers at events you d like to attend  Or try Officehours io  where you can browse potential advisors for free advice  Seek those who have acquired the titles you want  accomplished the goals you ve defined  built the products you love  or worked with companies you admire   Don t limit your mentor search to people in the design industry  Consider leaders in industries you d like to work with they can give you insight on what they value most in designers  and why  Or find specialists in areas where you lack expertise perhaps you d like to strengthen your business acumen  presentation skills  or digital knowledge  Look for people who have shown tenacity and endurance  and have gracefully transitioned their careers to match the needs of the market   Widen your search to cities other than your own  both nationally and internationally  We often work with others who don t live in our own city  and may not consider subtle factors that shape beliefs in other regions  It s well documented that San Francisco has an engineering history  while New York is rooted in finance and media  But you might not know why the startup scene in Beijing has more engineering talent than Hong Kong  Speaking with people from these different areas worldwide will only enrich and expand your possibilities   Make a list of 10 30 people you could learn from   Step 3  Initiate contact  You must make the first move  If you don t  no one else will do it on your behalf   To ease yourself into it  start with reaching out to your own network  and work your way up to speaking with strangers  With practice  it gets easier to approach those you don t know very well  And people can be surprisingly generous with their time the smartest leaders know that they don t know everything  and they ll want to hear your perspective in order to enhance their own knowledge   When introducing yourself to your prospective mentor  be sure to communicate   Specifics on what you admire about their career path  or anything else   A brief overview of your strengths and unique perspective  from Step 1   A personal goal you have  from Step 1   Then  ask if they could spare a future 15 minutes  either in person or via phone video chat  to discuss their perspective on your goal  and what they think would help you achieve it   Example   I ve been thinking about switching career paths to your area of specialty  I ve done a lot of research  but it d be great to hear first hand about your experience  Would you be able to spare 15 minutes for a quick chat next week  I can meet whenever or wherever is convenient for you    Ways to make contact   Ask people you already know  Send casual emails to your colleagues  friends  and family  and start practicing the process   Get a friend to introduce you  This works well when your good friend is also good friends with your prospective mentor  acquaintances are less successful   Use an email introduction to ask for their 15 minutes   Go to their speaking events  Be the first in line after the event  tell them what you enjoyed in their talk  and transition into your mentor ask  This is the easiest way to secure a future meeting with a stranger  because they get to vet you in person first   Send emails to people you don t know  Practice with your alumni network or Officehours io  then branch out and send short  friendly messages to people you greatly admire via Twitter  Medium  or their personal site   If you ve contacted 10 new people  you should have at least one new appointment   Step 4  Set the agenda  Remember  this chat is about using their valuable experience to inform your career path  Research each person so you don t waste time asking questions that Google can answer   Demonstrate that you ve done your homework  and tell them why their background is especially relevant to your goal because you re struggling with  work life balance  changing of technology  etc     Ask smart questions targeted towards achieving your specific goal  Use this opportunity to learn answers that aren t  one size fit all  and that are directly related to your problem at hand   Example   I noticed on LinkedIn that you switched career paths from ______ to ______  How did you successfully manage to do that  What was the hardest part  What do you wish you had known then that you do now    Show them your personality to see how you communicate and react to each other  With some people  you ll get viewpoints that won t resonate with yours  With others  light bulbs will go off and you ll want to refine your approach with their advice   Take the advice of one person and repeat it to others does it ring true to them  You ll find that everyone has a slightly different opinion  and the more people you speak with  the better informed you will be for the next meeting   Step 5  Aggregate the data  and repeat the process  Once you start gathering all this information  you ll realize you have more questions that need to be answered by people with different skills and expertise   After every meeting   Send a thank you note that reinforces the most valuable parts of your conversation  so they know what resonated with you   Ask for recommendations on who you should speak with next  Reshape your goals based on the new information you have received  Repeat your search for 10 new people  Think of yourself as the product you re looking to improve  and these meetings as user research interviews  Define the target segments you should speak with next  and reach out to them   And don t forget to keep in touch with updates on your progress  Share how their information has directly helped you so they can keep it in their problem solving toolkit   Step 6  Make your own rules  Steps 1 5 are based on what has worked well for me  I ve constantly sought out leaders to inform my own career path  and I ve personally met with product managers  business development  strategists  data analysts  and designers at dozens of companies  including Baidu  Google  The New York Times  MasterCard  MyFitnessPal  and Amplify  Speaking with people in all different areas opened my eyes to new ways of approaching problems  I ve been humbled many times by realizing how much more there is to learn   You can use these steps as a guide to modern mentorship  but I encourage you to experiment and find what works best for you  And don t hesitate to contact me and tell me about your approach so I can try it   If you re in NYC next Thursday  October 27th  I ll be speaking about Surviving Design Politics at Alpha headquarters  Location  details  and RSVP here  Come and say hi

1094,training-dataset/product/1156.txt,product,A product manager s guide to working with visual designersToday I m talking to Erik D  Kennedy  a self taught designer and former product manager  PM  at Microsoft who also has a background in computer engineering  He just released an awesome UI design course for non designers   What s the best way to give designers effective visual feedback   First  never say  I don t like it  without giving a reason  With enough people in the room  a design will never please everyone  What matters isn t whether a design meets the aesthetic preferences of every soul present  but if it solves the business problem at hand   Therefore  the best feedback is about problems  not solutions   Related  Designers share the worst feedback they ve ever gotten  It s not  I don t like this shade of blue   it s  I feel like this button doesn t draw attention enough given its importance   Maybe the way to fix the button is to change the shade of blue  but maybe it s to change the size or position or alignment or white space or any number of other properties  Your designers should be brimming with ideas about how to fix the problems you raise   I m a firm believer that a PM should be an expert in the user  the user s problems  and the business  The designer should be an expert in user interfaces  So if the discussion takes place at the border of those 2 specialities  it can be fruitful for both parties  A solution just handed to a designer for tweaking is of negative value first the designer has to reverse engineer your logic for coming up with this solution  then re work how the design should appear  It s less work to talk about business or user problems and let your designer astound you with their brilliance   That s what we shoot for  you know   And not to invalidate everything I just said  but I do have some clients who ll make direct interface suggestions   Dude  move this button here   Sometimes  those solutions are clearly awful and I need to train my client to give better feedback  but sometimes I have clients whose sense of design is so sharp  I feel that in another career  they d have done just fine in my role  I have no problem there  It s like working with another designer  even if that person is a PM or CEO or whatever   So how do you draw the line and know where you fall  Ask yourself if you have a good gut sense of design  Ask yourself if designers feel sharpened by your feedback   What design terminology should PMs be familiar with   Well  I wouldn t expect my PM to be intricately familiar with design terms  but I guess I can list a few things that come to mind   Of course the most hated piece of feedback is   it needs to pop more   So let s start with the term that will eliminate that from your vocabulary   visual weight    It s the fancy designer term for pop  It refers to the visibility of a given element  Visibility can be influenced by any number of things size  shape  space around it  color  really contrast   etc  So the sum of all of these things is called visual weight  and it s of the utmost importance that each element on a page have an appropriate visual weight   You can measure this with a squint test  scrunch up your eyes and list the elements of the page in the order they draw your attention  Does that ranked list correspond with which elements on the page are the most important  This is not a high fidelity test  but it s a useful measure that you re going in the right direction   Ultimately  visual weight is about corralling attention  The design should direct users  attention very precisely  PMs will want to know if a design is doing this  and then communicate with designers who will know a bunch of ways how to do it effectively  As a PM  a huge proportion of your feedback might be about this   It s that important    X height    baseline   and  cap height   Typography terminology is crazy  On one hand  you have these totally basic terms  serif    sans serif   which I hope you know already and then a lot of typography guides jump straight into this rather useless  arcane  and somewhat overlapping historical classification scheme  grotesque    geometric   etc  all come from that   Skip the historical naming scheme for now  and learn to focus a bit on 3 lines defined by most fonts   Fonts that butt up against the cap height and baseline are going to have a neat  crisp  clean feel  Fonts with a high x height are going to make more legible body fonts  The cap height and baseline are also useful for talking about centering fonts vertically   So the applications are pretty varied  but as far as practical terms surrounding type  these are ones that come up a lot for me   Note  I 100  recommend getting the chrome extension WhatFont  It allows you to quickly identify a font you see on any website  This is fantastic because it allows you to organically start building up the list of fonts in your head that you know  Maybe you like the font on Mint com   Oh  it s Circular  cool   Then you think   Man  Airbnb s font is so slick   And you realize that s Circular too  and you can develop this mental model about when Circular looks awesome  and what sort of site or app might want to use it   To be fair  this is your designer s job  but if you re able to converse fluently and throw out references and inspiration  I d respect the heck out of that   Helpful reference here   What UI basics are good for PMs to know   There are 2 basic use cases where a PM would want to be designing user interfaces  You want to create a vision mockup of a new feature or flow You don t have a solid visual designer and need to spearhead this yourself  In the former case  I think the biggest thing is this  don t re invent the wheel  Recycle anything from existing designs fonts  font sizes  colors  layouts  etc  This is certainly what I do when I m waltzing into a new gig and they have an established brand   But creating something more from scratch is tough  I can throw out a few pointers  and maybe that s about as good as we ll get in this article   Let s talk about alignment  When I was just starting out as a designer  I really had no idea just how important alignment is   What I ve realized since is alignment is the universal mark of human effort   Think about it  straight lines and alignment and right angles don t appear in nature  Rough approximations  sure  but not the real thing  I mean  I remember learning in Boy Scouts that if you re lost the wilderness you should make squares out of logs to attract attention from the sky  because geometric shapes just aren t natural   On the other hand  look at New York City  one of the most iconic human efforts of all time  It s full of alignment and right angles  The streets are a perfect grid  The skyscrapers reach up in parallel  Everything is lines  Lines  lines  lines   And so it is with our neatest  cleanest designs   You can see over a dozen straight lines in this design  by Creative Dash   But what s even more impressive is that of the forty odd elements on the first screen  every single one of them is aligned with at least one other element   That took me by surprise  Every single one   We re counting centering as a type of alignment  by the way    So this sense of alignment is huge   Unless you re making a data table with the expressed goal of showing as much data as possible  then you re going to be adding in some whitespace to your designs  And  if you re anything like me  the best amount of whitespace is almost always more than you initially expect   Why   At least for me  I came from the developer world  Whitespace is something you added in via CSS once the markup was there  But think about it  Unstyled HTML is all squished at the top of the page  It takes the maximum possible width and the minimum possible height  So when I d add in whitespace via CSS  I d be like  One pixel  Nah  more  Two pixels  Hm  more  Three pixels  Come on  we gonna do this forever     The opposite approach is to design starting with pen and paper  or with a design program like Sketch  When you start with a blank page or blank artboard  whitespace is the default  Every element you add is a conscientious whitespace removing decision  So you could easily draw something  and its digital equivalent means a piece of text has 50px of margin on top and bottom   Whoa  that s a lot    Sure  compared to what  Three pixels  Well  duh    One thing I go back to time and time again is a technique I call  fail left  fail right   The short version of the story is that  when I was learning to ride a unicycle  I hit a  metaphorical  plateau where I d keep falling off the front after pedaling about 1 5 rotations  Another more experienced rider saw me and instructed me to alternate falling off in front and falling off behind the unicycle   This was initially very challenging to do  You d think it wouldn t be  Lean back  dummy  But I had trained myself very carefully to always fail in the same way  By alternating failure between falling forwards and backwards  I taught my body where the range of possible solutions was between the failures   Likewise  in design  with whitespace or any other property you re adjusting  instead of starting at  normal  and adjusting from there  try to determine what is absolutely  positively too big of a value   Hm  this h1 cannot be 100px that s way too much    Then determine what s too small   It s also pretty uncompellingly small at 24px    And once you ve seen the extremes  you ll have a good sense of what might look best in the middle   Cool 44px is pretty beefy  but I really love how much it stands out      What s the best way to get better at design   I suppose this is my  teach a man to fish  answer here  If you really want to improve at design  it might be more useful for me to recommend exercises where you can teach yourself visual design  rather than insufficiently instruct you in all the intricacies of it in a quick interview   Copywork  recreating someone else s design pixel for pixel  is one such exercise  From my article in Smashing Magazine   Copywork is a technique that writers and painters have been using for centuries  It is the process of recreating an existing work as closely as possible in order to improve one s skill  In our case  this means recreating a user interface  UI  design pixel for pixel   The trick is to pick a design that is better than what you are currently capable of  By copying something outside of your wheelhouse  you will be expanding your skills   I give a bunch of examples of how it s improved my own design toolkit in the article  but perhaps one of the most pertinent points is that copywork is something I ll sometimes do when working on a project for a new client  It helps me absorb their existing style  That way  when I go to create my own designs  I m already familiar with the visual language that they re using to solve problems   Good reading if this is a skill you seriously want to develop   How does a PM develop a gut instinct for design   First of all  I think this is totally possible  I think there s generally 2 steps to this process   Find something that you know is designed well  visually  at least  Analyze why  The cool thing about this is anyone can do this process  You can be almost completely blind to what looks good and what doesn t  but as long as you can make the most basic distinction of what you like and don t  you can build from there   So for step 1  this could be anything  An email client  an ecommerce site  etc   For step 2  you re going to use your words and articulate what was done well  At first  this might sound silly and awkward because you don t really have the language for these things  but try   I like this because the font looks very  uh   important   Boom  Good enough   The point is  your brain is starting to try and build a framework around these new thoughts  What makes this font look  important   What other fonts look  important   When do  important  fonts look appropriate   That s the ladder you want to be on  Always recognizing  always analyzing  You ll develop a greater gut sense of what you like  you ll start to see patterns  and you ll develop a language for talking about these things  Then you can go tell your designer   Hey  the colors are really saturated given how formal this is it feels a bit incongruous  and I don t think our users will know we re a luxury brand  and they ll be slack jawed in amazement   Related  Lessons from 30 days in product management  If you were a PM and were presented with the first mockups of Craigslist  what feedback would you give   Well  this is tough  Craigslist is sort of the quintessential looks awful but works great site  Sure  we can all think of a wishlist feature or 2  and obviously the site looks like it had a rough night last night  but the fact that literally everyone knows about and uses it despite this is evidence that it is designed very well indeed   That being said  you want visual feedback  don t you  Romy  Hm  let s look at a page like this one   https   sfbay craigslist org search sfc kid  Here are some questions that come to my mind right away  and if I were a PM  I might relay on to a designer   The terms  pic  and  map  could be unclear to new users  What do those signify  How can we represent that  What does the trash icon do  We obviously can t delete someone else s listing  How can we explain that for users  One thing with lists is you want it to make it easy to compare the things you need to compare  For instance  places might be a good comparable  Or price that could be even better  Can we put those in their own column so they re easy to compare  That would have a double effect of increasing the neatness and alignment of the page  The breadcrumbs at the top use the smallest text using default browser controls and the logo is literally  CL  in Arial and doesn t give an impression that we have put a lot of care in it  So  let s either find a new job or make that look better  Why is there a bundle duplicates option  Would users want to see duplicates by default  I would suspect the opposite is true  The sidebar doesn t have an impression that it s separated from the main listings maybe there is a way to improve it visually  Cards could be an interesting thing to play with for the results  While cards should only be used if there are fairly complex objects represented within them  this might fit the bill  I could see this question going either way   And so on   How can PMs earn the respect of designers   You re ending on an easy one  I get to imagine my dream PM   They give good feedback  The best product managers give really good feedback  That feedback always ties back to the user or the product or the business  It always makes sense and has me imagining possibilities rather than just shutting down the current solution  They don t micro manage  The very best PMs I ve worked with are really busy and work with a lot of talented people  Maybe that s the cause of this  or maybe it s the effect  but they don t tend to micro manage designs  They ll mention a few key points I m missing  ones that might have large ramifications and cause me to re design pages and pages   but they have a commitment to shipping  a humility towards what we don t know about our users  and a respect for my craft and I never feel like I m micro managed  I m not sure how much other designers would agree with the assessment above  but I can speak from my own experience  They know the user and product cold  In the presence of a great PM  I can sit back and relax  I can stand up   standingdesk  and do my job  But I don t need to guess about if a user will understand a concept or metaphor  because I can ask and the PM will know  I don t need to guess if I m representing some feature wrong  or too strongly  or too weakly  because the PM will have a clear product vision,"[1094 166 573 145 1137 867 387 1322 543 1388 1167]"

1137,training-dataset/product/171.txt,product,The UX of hiring for UX positions If I were to just see you blind  I d think   Cute kid  Next     That s how Emily Rees  Director of Talent at The Stem  described how she normally would have reacted to Dan as a candidate for an information architect position when his resume landed on her desk in May of 1999   On paper  Dan had zero professional design training or experience and neither his B A  in English and performing arts nor his M S  in journalism stood out as typical qualifications for what she looked for to fill that role    But you were referred by someone high up in the organization  so that s what got you the interview   says Rees   Otherwise  you didn t fit what I was looking for  You got the job because of the interview    Rees isn t wrong in her thinking not then and not now as she still hires roles in the world of user experience  But as we started exploring how organizations hire UX professionals  the problem arose  What should you look for and why does that differ depending on who s looking   The problem is that 17 years after Dan  against the odds  landed that job  the world of information architecture has completely transformed  It has since evolved into the broader industry of user experience and is riddled with confusion around qualifications  titles  roles and  ultimately  what the right DNA of a user experience professional might be    To be brutally cold about it  it s the work they ve actually done  the experiences they ve had professionally  and the clients they ve been responsible for that are most important to determine whether or not you ll bring them in   says Rees  But that only applies to senior roles and still doesn t define what exactly that experience is   Initial hiring considerations  As we wrote in our previous article  The UX of Learning UX is Broken  one of the reasons it s unrealistic to think that people can become UX designers in a short amount of time is because of how rapidly the field is changing  The constant introduction and adoption of new platforms  devices  audience habits  and more make it a challenge for experience designers to stay current  In the same way this change affects people who want to become UX designers  it also makes it more challenging for companies looking to hire UX designers  researchers  or strategists   So in true UX fashion  we decided to go out and do some research  We talked to hiring managers  founders  senior UXers  and human resources professionals to understand their hiring processes  We wanted to identify the pain points they experience and hear about the mistakes they ve learned along the way  We learned that  not surprisingly  hiring UX designers is difficult  But we also heard a lot of great tips  ideas  and anecdotes that we think will help anyone who is looking to hire a UX designer   We turned the insights we ve gleaned from our conversations into a series of principles to keep in mind when hiring for positions in the UX field   Hire people  not skillsets  The problem with focusing on skills is that it hinges too much on specific software or process  By nature  many people in the UX field have a broad range of skills this is what makes them great at connecting the dots  developing insights  and being able to look at people and products in a holistic way  By focusing on a specific skillset  you could be completely disqualifying an amazing candidate   Amy Jackson  a UX and design talent agent based in Boston  has seen the impact firsthand  Amy has been in the industry for over 2 decades  and noted that  every time there is a change in our technology  there s a push for designers in that technology and that pool of designers doesn t even exist   Think back to 2007 when the iPhone first came out  Everyone wanted to hire people with iOS experience  but there s no way designers were experienced because it was so new  Companies were looking for skills that designers didn t have yet   This is why hiring based on a specific skillset is dangerous  Let s face it  there is still plenty of confusion when it comes to what various position titles mean  Companies often use terms such as unicorn  rockstar  or UI UX designer which are indicative of a larger problem they re focusing on a title and not the tasks   As a talent agent  when companies ask Amy to help them find a designer  she constantly reminds them that they need to  hire people  not skillsets   She helps the companies step back from titles and labels and has them focus on the exact problems they are trying to solve  New skillsets will always pop up as technology evolves   Figuring out what kind of people to hire is one of the biggest points of contention we found when speaking to recruiters versus those in senior UX positions    In my initial phone screens with people  I really like to gauge their critical thinking and understand how they solve a complex problem   says Jon Fox  the UX and Product Design Leader at OpenX  an enterprise ad exchange company   I don t want to walk through  their portfolio   I really gauge how they solve problems  how they translate complex business requirements into design  walking me through their process    Jess Brown  the Director of UX at Vice Media  looks at things similarly   Beyond demonstrated skill and experience in products they ve designed  I look for empathy and thoughtfulness in the design process   she says   Good UX designers can empathize with their users to design solutions that meet those users  needs  If they don t know who they re designing for  good designers will ask a lot of questions to help build this understanding    But how she would find a UX designer to hire is different than what many HR and recruiters that we spoke to are looking for    For individuals who are much more senior  who have several years of experience  it s much more someone who s had a degree in creative design concepts and a career working as an art director or senior designer   says Rees  which certainly makes it much easier when trying to filter through resumes   However    Backgrounds of practicing UX designers vary a lot  so there isn t a background I d automatically proceed with or rule out   says Brown   It may be an easier transition from related fields  so new UX designers may have a leg up if they have experience in graphic design  marketing  or psychology     When I got interviews I did well   says Shalyn Oswald  a UX UI Mobile Designer at Bluewolf NYC  whose previous experience included working at an insurance company and slogging her way through General Assembly s  GA  10 week UXDI immersive program   But it was getting the interview that was the hardest as I don t have a graphic design background    Basically  just finding the right type of people is already a dissonant challenge for the variety of sides trying to hire in this industry    Once they come in the door  it s really about how they think and how they can talk about both past work and be presented with a problem that you re experiencing at that company   says Oz Lubling  who runs product at One Drop  a mobile diabetes management platform   It s not about the design I don t care about what they would do from an actual design process  it s how would you arrive at it and how you d explore that    Similarly  Elizabeth Osder  Head of Revenue at Lakana  a software solution and content management system for media companies  says that successful user experience professionals  can come from a creative background  a content background  or a tech background  Most of the people I have hired in the past have come from content and creative backgrounds    Osder  incidentally  was the person who originally recommended Dan to Rees way back when    I ve seen a lot of people that just have come from liberal arts backgrounds  philosophy  English and have found interesting ways of getting into it   says Lubling  who is in his second decade practicing UX after coming to it from a computer science background  he was also employee number one at Razorfish    I don t think the background matters all that much    Where it really breaks down  says Lubling  is what you re hiring for  There s a difference between how to hire for building enterprise applications versus a new virtual reality experience  where  maybe not knowing anything about anything would be better  Maybe coming out of a left field situation could be better    Fox agrees  OpenX is an enterprise platform and if an experienced candidate comes to them that has  made a bunch of agency sites  that s going to prove much more of a challenge   he says   Honestly  if what interests you is doing really cool flashy sexy sites  you re not going to be too thrilled with the work we re doing here   and that what they re looking for is  a level of critical thinking that can take complex business requirements and use cases that can understand the value of different business logic and be able to create design from that    Not surprisingly  experience becomes a theme throughout this entire process  but so does focus  Rees echoes Fox s thoughts  saying  it s important for us to have people who have pharmaceutical experience because there are all sorts of regulatory and legal requirements that may not have any impact on a luxury goods product    When it comes down to it  she says   if someone doesn t have that experience  no matter how good their skills  they may have a learning curve that s too steep for my purposes    So where do we start  How and when do we specialize  And is it ever  or even  okay to be a generalist  In the end  it takes a complicated combination of HR filters and user experience know how to bring together the best candidates    We work with HR to find candidates who have experience that looks good on paper   says Brown   But the true evaluation for designers is always in their portfolio    The portfolio  Moving from deliverables to discussion   If they re really interesting  I might Google them and if I can t find their portfolio  they re out   states Fox   The requirement of the portfolio as the gateway into a hiring conversation is unanimous among everyone we spoke to  Don t have a portfolio  That s a non starter    Seeing a portfolio is a must for evaluating a designer s work   says Brown   In a portfolio  I m looking to assess the thoughts behind the final design decisions  What were the goals  What research  if any  informed the designs  What considerations were most important  What trade offs were made and why    One of the biggest challenges in reviewing portfolios  both for UX and visual design  is understanding what the person actually did on a project  It s all fine and good to show that you worked on a large scale product launch for Salesforce or a successful redesign for Uber  but the real question is around what you actually did versus the rest of the team  The good news is that most people hiring don t expect or want you to have done everything  but rather that you re honest about what you contributed  why  and how   UX is  in the end  just one part of a collaborative process and the idea that one person can claim credit for everything is rare and  often  untrustworthy   All of this is because it s just the first step   The portfolio is to get a sense of what they ve worked on and what the quality of that work is   says Lubling   It s more a reference or a guide as to how to start the conversation  Also a good way to eliminate a lot of the people that don t have the baseline of what you re looking for whether it s hard or soft  Then when you talk to them they can walk you through what that process was like    The most important thing to remember is that people who are hiring just want to see your work  Figure out the best way for you to showcase it because before anyone ever clicks on that attachment or link in their email  they re most likely rooting for you  They want to fill the position they re looking for and if you re the person who s right for it  everyone wins  The challenge is how you differentiate yourself    People who are coming out of agencies who are working on sexy projects probably have better portfolios because of what they worked on   says Joanne Laipson  Head of Recruiting  Staff  and Search at The Osder Group  based in Los Angeles   You have no idea when you see a person coming out of an agency  how much they contributed versus the whole team   Which basically means  don t let your work speak for itself give it context  highlight your contributions and how they relate to your skillset and do it in such a way that makes sense for the work you re doing    The format of a portfolio is less important than the content   says Brown   In fact  I m fine with seeing work in a PDF or shared Dropbox the meat of the work is the work itself  not putting it in a snazzy online format  although that s great too    It really comes down to showcasing what you re good at   If visual design is not your strong suit but you make amazing wireframes and you really get to the heart of the problem then awesome   says Fox   You should focus on that  If you re not very good at visual design  don t show off your visual design  If you re really good at wireframing and process flows  show me that    Trying to copy someone else s style of portfolio will probably backfire on you anyway  For years  people preached to us that our resumes had to follow a specific format and  in the end  wading through a sea of carbon copied job lists is dull and the opposite of how design and UX works anyway  Originality  and usability  can go a long way here  which is one of the major problems we ran into when discussing the plethora of excited potential junior user experience designers that are storming the industry right now    Because they do a lot of group projects  I can recognize a lot of the same projects over and over again   says Fox regarding the those who have  graduated  from General Assembly s immersive UX program   I interviewed someone a year and a half ago that I brought in on the strength of a project where she had done this redesign of Target com on her own  She did research  she created personas  she broke down the use cases  and created flows  It was super impressive  I need to see students out of GA or any other program have that type of work and articulate that they know the material and that they are ready to take things on    You could say the portfolio itself is the first expression of how you think  how you organize information  what the story is that you re telling about yourself  You could say that about a resume as well  but really  in the world of UX and design  you come across best through the work you ve done  And this is why every person s portfolio can  and should  differ   One candidate  only showed one project and he showed the 20 steps from brief to deliverable   is an example that Gregg Bernstein  Senior UX Researcher at Vox Media  gives   He blew them away  It wasn t all perfect  It was all the mis steps    The crux  as Bernstein alludes to above and as Lubling and Fox have suggested as well is a person s ability to communicate the process was behind the work    They need to be able speak about how they went through it   says Osder  who has held senior positions at OpenX  Yahoo  and The New York Times   They understand they have a methodology and they can tune it to how they are working  That s what we re looking for    Talent trumps training  The skillsets and experiences people have in many other fields are very fitting for being great at UX  But when companies decide to require a certain level or type of education  they automatically exclude many people who could have been a perfect fit   Bernstein recently experienced this  He needed to hire a competitor researcher but wasn t exactly sure of the skillset that would be needed for that role  As a result  he knew he couldn t write a job description with exact education requirements  certifications  or software knowledge  So instead  he focused on not what someone had previously done  but envisioned what that person would do in the role   Along the lines of the approach in Jared Spool s article Your Job Ad  The Start of a Great Hiring Experience  Bernstein focused on painting a picture of the future so that ideal candidate could envision themselves in the role self identifying their unique skills with the exact scope of work that they will be doing  So who did Bernstein end up hiring  After putting out a job description that focused on the specific tasks someone would be doing  he found the person he needed  Did the person have UX training  Nope  The person he hired had a degree in library sciences another industry with a background in organization  methodical thinking  and information accessibility  But the person s talent and previous experience perfectly fit the tasks that needed to be done in the competitor researcher role    I realized that as a library scientist  she was doing the tasks I needed someone to do  but it wasn t in the field of UX  She was researching topics  managing information  cataloguing findings  and developing insights and suggestions that would help people more easily find what they were looking for    Brown has a similar approach   I often give very open ended  almost far fetched  design challenges for candidates to whiteboard and sketch out solutions to   she says   It s less about finding an ultimate solution and more about understanding how they think    Indeed  both of our careers commenced from non traditional circumstances  With degrees in literature  theater  and journalism  Dan was able to translate the skills of analysis  information organization  communication  and collaboration from those fields into what he does every day  Sarah pursued a degree in marketing because it seemed to blend her interest in design  communication  and business  and in hindsight she didn t know that programs such as HCI even existed   However  this program combined with years of hands on experience in graphic design  web design  and front end development provided an intimate understanding of product development and why UX is so important to help keep all teams focused on the user    Storytelling s huge   adds Oswald  whose education is rooted in literature as well   You have to read through 700 pages of Adam Bede or something and think about  why did they do this  and I m like   according to this point  this point  and this point  this is why they made that decision   This is what I do in my job  too  Because of this  this  and this  it makes sense    Talent isn t necessarily as black and white as adapting and applying skills from outside the industry  There are other important qualities to consider beyond them  which Brown lists as  curiosity  empathy  and an ability to problem solve  Attitude is so important to new UX designers  and having a beginner s mind coming into a problem can be an asset  Basic hard skills are important  but a new designer doesn t necessarily have to be amazing with all of their tools and methodologies at the start  Learning these on the job can happen independently  since designers will find time to play around with new tools or products    The unaddressed elephant in the room here  of course  is those who actually have gone through training programs whether it be higher education degrees or short term boot camps that promise to cram a lot of education into a compact timeline   Training should be thought of in 2 groups  accelerated programs versus long form programs  Short programs such as boot camps  though likely information dense  should not be considered as adequate training  Boot camps  in any industry or field  should be reframed as being supplemental to someone s career and not a starting point   Certainly  higher education programs can be a plus because they immerse students for several years into the challenges the user experience community face every day    If someone falls in your lap that went to Carnegie Mellon and studied HCI formally  they d be easier to vet   says Lubling  but he s not advocating it as a mandatory    I look at those kind of people in a much deeper technical light   says Osder  who did the Human Computer Interaction  HCI  program at Stanford   The psychology and research you get in those programs would be strong for a research led person  In experience design  I would be looking for anybody with a background in improvisation as well as process driven like anthropology or sociology where there s a methodology    As we ve seen from everyone we talk to  regardless of their company size  role  or background  what matters most  to use Osder s words  is  for a candidate to be able to understand and break down a topic  disassemble it  and reassemble it    The trends today around education tend to fall in quick fix programs   aka boot camps   that seem to offer a veritable pot of gold at the end of the rainbow  The problems is  they only offer skills to produce deliverables without the experience to think through the complex problems a true professional needs to be successful in this industry   Ben Congleton  Founder of Olark  commented   the value in boot camps is to extend someone s experience   there s value in a Project Manager going through a UX boot camp or a Project Manager going through a coding boot camp   In this example  the Project Manager would get a well rounded deep dive into UX so that they would be better equipped to collaborate with UXers   The idea that a boot camp is sufficient as standalone training for a UX person is simply setting the person up for failure   Congleton notes that if a UX candidate has been through a boot camp  then there should be evidence that they ve done things to  go beyond a boot camp to continue their learning and show passion for the field     They come in here and they have absolutely no idea how collaboration is supposed to take place   adds Fox  describing the challenges that boot camps bring by siloing UX away from developers  project managers and other disciplines   That definitely means that they are not equipped to take on projects    Longer training programs provide a more thorough blend of theory and practice  The extended duration also puts students in more situations where they ll have to collaborate with many different types of people and stakeholders and deal with real life challenges that come up  This simply can t happen in a shorter program  In addition to providing students with more opportunity to get hands on experience  longer programs demonstrate that someone is passionate about a field  It s an extensive time and financial commitment to get a Masters of HCI  Human Computer INteraction  from Carnegie Mellon University or pursue the MFA in Interaction Design from SVA   The certification question   I can spot a UX candidate from GA from their portfolio or their LinkedIn   says Fox   That is not a good thing    Fox goes on to say that the  GA tell  on LinkedIn is that  graduates  of their immersive programs  always have their name dash UX Designer  That s a red flag for me    In all honesty  the problem with certifications in general is that they don t mean anything in the UX world  the exceptions to this  which we ll discuss below  are much more specific than anything GA offers     Certifications have not mattered   says Rees  who does acknowledge their value in other fields such as project management   Although there are methodologies and best practices in UX  I don t know if it needs to be as highly structured or stringent  Anyone who takes a 12 week course thinking they re going to come out prepared for a career is being lead astray  A 12 week GA course is not going to prepare you for a career shift or a career in itself    At best  these short term programs can open your eyes to the industry  but that seems like a pretty expensive eye opener when you think about the myriad books and resources out there to learn    I am upfront with GA grads that we can t work with them for another couple years   says Joanne Weaver  who has run her own UX UI recruiting firm in New York City for the past 9 years   We d love to keep in touch with them  We want to have that open door let s keep the conversation going as you get more experience    Experience seems to be the main objection to these programs  Thinking back to the portfolio section and what that says about a potential UX candidate  showcasing independent thinking is so critical and when you go through a program working on the same projects with other UX people  there s a tremendous amount of homogeny   As Fox noted  it s easy to spot a GA graduate because so many of their projects are group based  resulting in repetitive projects over and over again   Oswald says she had no UX experience going into the GA program and that before the class most of her experience was in working on sites for her band or her friends  but that she has  always been a people watcher and empathetic over thinker  reading a lot of books  studying reactions  etc   This independent spirit is what got her through the GA program    It worked for me  but I was there almost 7 days a week   she says  adding that while the program was eight hours a day  five days a week  she was typically there 12 14 hours voraciously working on every project the GA program could throw her way    I really immersed myself in it because I found something that I was passionate about it  I was like I don t mind being there  this work is hard but it s also fun   she says  emphasizing that because she wasn t working at a job and was paying a lot to be there  that she wanted to get everything out of it she possibly could   But while she has the same certificate as everyone else that came out of the program  she admits that she is the exception to the rule  A lot of students  she says   just didn t take it as seriously as I did  This was in addition to whatever they had  They thought   I m just going to plop this onto my resume and have it on there     No matter what you do  though  there is a common theme from everyone we spoke to that Oswald sums up   The week long one and the claims to all that you ll learn is absolutely ridiculous    Fox agrees  adding   they set this expectation with their graduates that they are going to be able to get a mid  to senior level job and that s just not true    As we mentioned  there are exceptions to the value of certification   as there are to any rules  Many larger organizations use certifications like those fromHuman Factors International  HFI   to help gauge the seniority of their employees  While this may not be something the UX industry as a whole accepts  it s an understandable  and stringent  process that corporations with an excessive amount of bureaucracy need to use for non UX oriented executives or human resources teams to gauge how a person can excel in an organization    In the case of large corporations  I can see how certifications come into play in terms of job titles and salaries   says Jeff Gothelf  author of Lean UXandSense and Respond   Also  outside of the United States  certifications seem to be held in a higher regard and can often lead to someone getting hired in at a more senior level    We still stand by the idea that this isn t the best solution for how strong a candidate is for the same reasons why you can t gauge a person s intelligence based on standardized tests  A lot of the requirements to pass exams by companies like HFI are based on memorization and textbook based learning  which is antithetical to how people succeed in a field which is all about understanding humans  how they think  how they feel and how that changes regularly   Understand who you need to hire for today   Unless you re going to work for an agency where you re getting paid for the work product  at less formal environments like startups it s more of a judgement call   says Lubling of his experience in hiring for a variety of UX positions in wide ranges of companies   The background in those circumstances can vary from one candidate to another    Bernstein noted   The 2 qualities I look for are humility and diplomacy   you must be a diplomat   It s very easy to spot someone who doesn t possess these qualities  Bernstein uses the resume as an example  A resume can either be structured in a way that shows someone is ambitious for themselves or ambitious for the team  If a resume has a lot of language about the  I  and not much about the  team  then you know the person probably isn t very humble or diplomatic   It s a concept Bernstein learned from Steve Kerr  Head Coach of the Golden State Warriors  In a recent issue of ESPN s The Magazine  Kerr spoke about the types of people he seeks to hire  Kerr says   They re all unselfish and committed to the team but ambitious and hardworking  I think ambition can go 2 ways  You can be ambitious and be part of the team  or you can be ambitious for your own career  I like people who are ambitious for the team    It s also important to consider what type of person your organization as a whole can actually set up for success in the role   In research  strategy  and design there are a lot of wrong turns we make on our way to finding the right solution  There are some constants  such as those mentioned above and that any designer must be able to check their ego at the door  but every team has different needs  A startup is not IBM  What works for Pfizer may not work for Delta Airlines  a lead UX role at Twitter could require an entirely different mindset than a lead at Chase   Gothelf  the former Principal at Neo Innovation  spoke about how important it is for teams to be honest about who they can support  While at Neo  the team made a conscious decision that they couldn t hire junior designers  Being a small company  Neo couldn t dedicate time to training junior designers  Gothelf noted   We didn t have time to teach the craft  We needed people who could hit the ground running  We could not mentor people in the how of UX    This becomes a huge problem for people who want to enter the industry as newbies no matter what their backgrounds are    This is a big problem in our industry  Who wants to have designers on their team that they need to babysit   asks Fox   I need someone to sit there with a product manager and be able to get it done  But where are they going to come from    Fox adds that most junior designers start in the agency world  which tends to be a great learning atmosphere for them   They can get used to the process and get into a few firefights   he adds   You need to be able to adapt and grow beyond that so you can dive deeper    Many of the people we talked to expressed concern about the lack of transparency that companies have when it comes to what they expect of the candidate and what the company culture will be like   Gothelf comments that  where many companies fail is that they don t communicate the organization s value for design and the strategic impact of the design discipline  It s absolutely missing from most job descriptions  It ll say something like  You ll work with engineers and PMs to discuss requirements  but how does that work  Where does design really fit in the organization    It s not just about being clear about how design fits into the organization  Companies must be clear about the expectations they have for candidates  What opportunities will a designer have for career growth  What is the measure of success  What are expectations for leadership   Gothelf observes that UX teams end up being quite silo ed and roles tend to be more specific  For example  larger companies have the budget for specialized roles such as a dedicated user research team  with specific roles on that team  Larger companies are often eager to staff up their UX teams  This can be dangerous though because  as he says   larger companies are often just trying to put bodies in seats   which easily leads to very silo ed teams  Often this is fueled by a knowledge that UX matters  but without a strategy in place   At a smaller company  though  there s more collaboration and thus  a candidate with a more generalist background will be a better fit as they ll be forced to be involved in more of the entire product development process    The main distinction with the smaller the team is you have more UX UI   says Lubling   For example  the people I have here are people who can do everything  They typically do visual design or UX  one or the other better and I tend to help complement that    There is an ultimate danger to the  unicorn   though  When a company is first starting  it may be fine to find a jack of all trades  but that won t make for a great UX designer or anything else in the end   Unicorns have never actually existed not in nature nor in the internet and searching for them will lead you down a path of confusion  disappointment  and  ultimately  a lot of lost dollars   Linda Escobar  Senior Researcher at AlphaUX  offers that she also encounters a lot of candidates who want to be perceived as being able to do it all   Many candidates believe that the more things they list  the better they look to the hiring team   she says   But that s not the case  I prefer a focus someone who s good at one or 2 things someone who s always evolving and learning  instead of chasing the buzzword of the moment    One last consideration  There are people who try to do everything in the internet and people who try to do everything in UX  There s a place for the latter  depending  again  on what you want from them  And that s where we fall into the world of UX  We are  for better or worse  generalists    I love generalists  My team is more generalists  I definitely believe in generalists   says Fox   But I think you need to have at least one aspect that is a strong suit  If it s going to be design  then you really need to be a good designer and understand what makes good design and be able to deliver on that    The industry is always changing  and the fundamentals stay the same  Hiring generalists for our team makes sense because our clients come from all different industries and require a variety of skills at a time  But the principles above apply for everyone we would talk to as well   Backgrounds should vary  Communication skills are paramount  Humility and listening go without saying  Demonstrated problem solving skills are a must  Specific education rarely comes into play  Certification and boot camps can be a starting point  but not an indicator of proficiency  Passion and curiosity are required  While the field of UX is constantly changing  the principles for finding  vetting  and hiring UX designers can stay constant  The challenge is that what sets the UX industry apart is that the thinking behind what works is constantly in flux  For an accountant  tax rules may change  but the science is pretty much the same  For a Starbucks barista  there s a set program  With UX  there s no true police academy to graduate from to become an officer of usability   As those of us who practice UX graduate into senior roles  we have to remember that we and our expert peers arrived here in so many ways  We re a strange cornucopia of individuals who keep on learning   And god knows whoever we hire next  we re going to learn a ton from them  too   This post was originally published on Medium,"[1137 1167 75 1083 808 434 785 479 274 355 1322]"
1157,training-dataset/product/16.txt,product,Reimagining a SaaS platformConductor launched as a search engine optimization  SEO  platform in 2010  In the 6 years since  we ve grown to tackle so much more than enterprise SEO for marketers   Our Searchlight platform encompasses SEO  content strategy  competitive intelligence  and paid search optimization  Our customers brands like Citibank  FedEx  Birchbox  and JustFab have asked for numerous enhancements  adding to the volume and complexity of functionality   But let s go back a few months  On a Friday afternoon  I flopped into my desk chair  weary from deliberating where to add a link to a new feature in Searchlight s navigation  Nearby  I could hear a colleague speaking with a customer over the phone  The customer asked   I know we covered this in training  but where is that report we talked about    That s when it hit me  We needed to step back to consider Conductor s experience holistically  What kind of first impression were we making  Could our customers intuitively find and understand all the new technology we created  Was the navigation supporting our users in the best possible way   We needed to re evaluate the platform s information architecture  IA  and navigation   Does your design keep pace with the speed of product innovation   It s a challenge many SaaS platforms face  Your product has changed almost unrecognizably since launch your technology has evolved  and your customers have multiplied and evolved  too  You can t put your finger on the moment it all changed  but it s night and day when you look at it from a distance   That s exactly what happened to us   I d like to share how we created and executed a plan to reimagine our product s experience to evolve the platform while respecting our existing and loyal users   Signs it s time for a platform redesign  It might be time to take a look at your IA and navigation if you notice that   During usability tests for other features  users struggle to find items in the navigation  Users spend a lot of time navigating to complete a common or key flow  Imagine an ecommerce site where you couldn t get directly to your shopping cart from every product page not good   Users contact Support with questions about where to find things  Where to find important screens or functionality is a focus of the onboarding or training experiences  It s challenging to find a natural home in the existing organizational structure of the navigation for a new screen or feature  You need to add another section or item into the navigation but there s no room for it  The site or application map documentation isn t up to date  Planning your redesign strategy  The signs can indicate problems with how content is organized  the navigation s interaction design  scalability  or a combination thereof  To ensure due diligence in all areas  we decided to focus on 3 aspects of navigation independently but in parallel  information architecture  interaction design  and visual look and feel  We d converge these 3 separate design tracks later on   Assessing the status quo  Learn from current user behavior  Before designing  analyze the current experience to identify aspects to preserve  eliminate  add  and improve   We created an up to date site map  then dove into an analysis of the current platform  leveraging observational research  user feedback  and usability testing in order to answer for each design track   What was working well   What were the usability issues   What was missing   Were there specific flows that could be improved   Crafting your design goals  Our design team always defines project goals that are distinct from user stories  They re used to help make decisions during the design process and vet a design s effectiveness  For a redesign  goals help ensure new designs aren t just different  but better experiences   Our overall goal was to make the robust platform feel simple  But how  Armed with our earlier assessment  we identified goals that all designs in each track would be evaluated against   Organize the platform s IA to align with an existing mental model of our users Create one consistent  unchanging navigation menu that contains all of the platform s content and clearly indicates to the user where they are in the platform  Eliminate separate navigation experiences in sub sections  Remove all extraneous or distracting elements such as icons without utility Provide affordances and set clear expectations in the interaction design Minimize clicks to get between screens  particularly for most common workflows Define and apply a new visual look and feel for Conductor Searchlight Create a scalable  future proofed system  Section names should remain relevant and the menu s design won t limit the number of items it can contain   Discovering the right information architecture  Speak to users  Speaking directly with users is the best way to identify their mental models and understand how they seek out information  Recognize their differences  but also look for similarities   To identify possible organizational strategies  we began simply with our site map and a whiteboard to conduct a content inventory  listing for each screen ways that could be used to categorize it  However  a great IA is structured around how people seek out information  so we needed to get inside the heads of our customers   The product and design team had been conducting multi hour interviews with customers to determine their motivations  needs  and challenges  We wanted to better understand how they fit into the digital marketing ecosystem of their organization and spent their days beyond Searchlight   Digital marketing  particularly organic content marketing  is a young  fast growing industry that s still evolving  As a result  we were struggling to identify patterns based on organizational structure  how responsibilities were assigned to individuals  and even aspects of organic marketing  Capturing the differences in a few key personas seemed nearly impossible   Yet interview after interview  a similarity far greater than their differences emerged  Yes  the role of an SEO strategist or content marketer varied greatly across organizations  and yes  they were are all using different tools  investing different amounts of time  and performing marketing activities for different reasons  But they were all performing the same activities   We created a prototype organizing screens under imperative sentences representing these  Digital Marketing Activities   such as  Measure Visibility  and  Investigate Competition   The usability test results were remarkable  Users with expertise in only one or 2 particular activities understood what the rest of the platform could offer  and users with deep knowledge of the existing platform easily reoriented themselves in this new structure  We d merged the best in class activities learned from our customers into the IA as a workflow   The IA was successfully vetted against the design goals by considering  Will these sections continue to be relevant as the industry evolves  Will it work for future screens we may not have thought of yet   Designing the navigation s interaction  Don t pull any old pattern off the shelf explore or create interactions that make sense for how people want to interact with your site or application   We explored 2 very different approaches to the interaction  One was a hidden menu its biggest asset was opening up valuable screen real estate for our users who want to consume a lot of data at once  It failed in testing because of the frequency with which users switch screens  the extra step to expose the menu  even on hover  proved cumbersome   The other approach  a horizontal menu  felt more familiar to the existing experience  We improved its efficiency by keeping it visible on screen when scrolling down  allowing the user to move through a flow without having to scroll back to the top of the screen  The lesson here is don t change everything  Some features can simply be tweaked to improve  rather than be drastically changed   Finding a visual identity  Design goals are immensely helpful for getting alignment on visual design  too  Leverage mood boards in place of the written word   This project was an opportunity for us to align Searchlight s visual styling with who Conductor is today  As I mentioned earlier  the design team crafts goals in order to focus the process and vet designs  We chose to leverage mood boards in order to do that for the visual design  We took a research based approach to define this identity too  We asked stakeholders questions such as   If Conductor were a physical space  what would it be   and we drafted 8 distinct mood boards based on the interviews   We then conducted a focus group style sessions  We asked individuals to describe each mood board in their own words and rank them based on how much or little they  felt  like Conductor  We used the findings to synthesize a unified mood board that now acts as our guiding light for all Searchlight visual design  In review sessions  designers and non designers alike can better discuss whether a new visual design  feels  like Conductor   Converging the tracks  Look for last minute opportunities  When combining separate tracks of a project  re evaluate the merged concept  A sum is greater than its parts  and there may be unforeseen problems or even more improvements to be made   With due diligence completed  the new IA and navigation interaction design were combined in a new prototype  While we created a visual design inspired by the mood board  we conducted additional user testing  Seeing everything together  we noticed the navigation s horizontal layout supported our left to right digital marker workflow very well  We spotted an opportunity to add section descriptions into the menus to aid in learnability   The reimagined platform  A new IA and navigation experience  Late on this Friday afternoon  I m excitedly working on some new screens and I know exactly where they ll go in the navigation  Nearby  a colleague is speaking with a customer over the phone  and they are not discussing navigation  Our customers can focus entirely on creating compelling content  increasing traffic  and getting higher organic marketing ROI because the new experience seamlessly supports their activities   When we first entertained the idea of redesigning the IA and navigation  it felt like we were entering uncharted waters  Taking a methodical  user centered  and research based approach helped us create a re imagined experience that feels  simple  to new and existing users alike   Read more Design Teardowns,"[1157 698 1322 891 188 618 1259 145 260 231 166]"
1167,training-dataset/business/898.txt,business,Jared Spool on UX designJared Spool has been helping product companies solve their design problems for decades  Most folks know Jared through User Interface Engineering  UIE   the leading research  training and consulting firm specializing in product usability  Having spent the past 28 years working with clients at UIE  he s keenly aware of where and why many young UX designers struggle  To help remedy that  he s co founded a unique school  Center Centre  to produce a new generation of industry ready designers  The inaugural class begins its journey on October 17  Jared recently joined me on the podcast to chat about why design graduates struggle in the workplace and what the Center Centre curriculum is doing differently  We also get into why all parts of your own company must have an appreciation of design to succeed  and how to cross what Jared calls  the UX Tipping Point   If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the interview  Short on time  Here are four key takeaways  In Jared s conversations with hiring managers  it became apparent that many design graduates lacked the field knowledge necessary to succeed  Center Centre emphasizes project work to correct this   One major issue with typical university level design programs is that hiring companies don t interact with students until nearly graduation  Having leaders and hiring managers in the classroom on day 1  helps shape the program around job market needs   The design world is moving closer to an era of certification  but for hiring managers  it s key there s an explicit understanding of what the certification represents   To produce the highest grade of product  garner the highest customer loyalty and command the highest prices  companies must reach the UX Tipping Point   where you actually won t ship a product until it s designed to your standards   Des Traynor  Jared  it s an absolute pleasure to have you here  So you re still involved at User Interface Engineering  but you re also spending a lot of time on a new initiative  which is confusingly called Center Centre  What is it  and what s the thinking behind the name  Jared  it s an absolute pleasure to have you here  So you re still involved at User Interface Engineering  but you re also spending a lot of time on a new initiative  which is confusingly called Center Centre  What is it  and what s the thinking behind the name  Jared Spool  It s a new school for industry ready UX designers   The name  plays into being multiple types of a center  A good school is a place where community  education and industry come together  We see  Center Centre  as a place where all those things come together to do good work  The way we ve structured the school  the students are going to be very active in the community  They re going to be very active in the industry throughout their education  At the same time  it s a place where new thinking and new ideas emerge from  Things come from the center  things come to the center  Two types of center  so therefor  Center Centre  Des  You talked about creating this new generation of designers  The adjective you use was  industry ready   What s the difference between an industry ready designer  and someone who graduates from a typical art and design college  Jared  We are definitely not a typical art and design college  We are without art   and we are just design  We re a vocational school  It s very much about making people ready for work  Universities were not built for trades  Universities were made to create educators  actually  The first universities were built in the 15th and 16th centuries to spread the word of the church  What they needed were people who could teach the word of God  They created a system for producing teachers  not for producing people who could work a trade  The structure of those universities hasn t changed much since the 16th century  We still use the same basic constructs  When my partner  Dr  Leslie Jensen Inman  and I started on this project  we did what you do when you have a good project   we went out and did research  We started talking to hiring managers  While students are our primary customer  hiring managers are customers too  If we don t produce graduates that the hiring managers want to hire  we will fail as a trade school  We have to make very desirable hiring managers  When you hire somebody what is it you look for  particularly when you hire students  What is it that you feel you re not getting  We found that while students had a lot of book knowledge   they knew how to do design as it was prescribed in books   they didn t have a lot of field knowledge  They didn t have a lot of experience  They couldn t do very much  and the result is they re not getting jobs right out of school   We have more jobs than ever  We estimate in the United States there are somewhere between 70 000 80 000 UX positions right now  Students coming right out of school are having a lot of trouble filling those jobs because they re not ready  So much so  that companies like IBM have built entire institutions  In Austin  IBM has  in essence  a school where they take students who have come out of design school  and they give them another six months of training  Not on things specific to IBM   that s only three weeks of the six months   but on basic workplace skills  In order to make students ready to sit down and do the job the day they get there  they have to have a lot of experience  So we built an experience based program that students work on real life projects  Projects that are assigned  Projects that come from real life companies  and community based projects  They last 3 5 months  and students work on them as a team  They are not expected to project lead them at the beginning  because project leadership is a learned skill  We don t throw them at the wolves and then wonder why their projects were so poorly managed  like so many school projects end up being  They come out of the program with two years of experience  As a result  they are much more attractive to companies looking to hire them  Des  When you say  experience   is it specific  Do you have modules on things like how to create a persona  How to assess a site navigation  How to wireframe  How to do a usability test  Jared  Yeah  that s just the beginning  The first course is information architecture  The second course is sketching and prototyping  The third course is user research practices  Then we get into front end development and go from there  We have courses on leadership  critique  design studios  personas and storytelling  workshop facilitation  the business of user experience  how to design for social  etc  We have 30 courses that are taken over two years  Des  It is full time  Do students move to Chattanooga  Tennessee and enroll there  Jared  It s full time  We have a lovely facility in downtown Chattanooga  The students live in Chattanooga and go to school five days a week  We modeled it after a full time job  One of the things the hiring managers told us is one of the things they have to deal with is a lot of students come out of school and for many years  they have been taught it they can sit still for an hour and a half  they can go play Frisbee  That s the basic structure of school  The hiring managers are telling us they have trouble just getting these people to sit and work for an entire day  We decided to fix that problem  School will be structured for an entire day  So instead of taking multiple classes   each one is three hours or an hour and a half   you take one class for three weeks  It starts at 8 30 a m  and it ends at 5 p m  There s no homework  You do the work at school  Then you go and reinvigorate over the weekend  and you come back to school ready to work  Bringing hiring companies into education earlier Des  What s your first real sign of feedback from this cohort  which enrolls this fall  Will it be two years time when you ll know how that worked out  Jared  No  no  no  We ve built feedback in all the way  In a lot of programs  the companies finally get involved just as the students are graduating  Maybe there s a career day  maybe there s a capstone project at the end that the company sponsors  In this program  companies are involved all the way through  They supply projects for students to work on  so they re watching the students go through  Every three weeks we have a new class starting  and the first two days of class an industry expert comes and delivers a two day industry grade workshop on the topic   For example  we have Abby Covert coming in and talking about information architecture for two days  Dana Chisnell  who wrote the handbook of usability testing and is one of the highest placed UX people in the federal government  is introducing data research  We have all these industry experts coming in  We re inviting the companies to come and participate in those workshops  while at the same time they get a chance to meet the students and see their progress  The goal is for the students to get feedback from those folks  from people that work on the projects  from mentors they are assigned to  who have volunteered their time  They get that feedback all the way through the program  and we re getting feedback from those folks saying   Yeah  this is the type of person I want to hire  or I would like to see this   We ve actually kept the last six months of the program undefined  We ll start to define it about 12 months into the program  We leave this undefined because we want to be able to catch things that are new and emerging that we didn t know people needed to know  For example  machine learning is becoming a hot topic  There s this nascent idea of  how do you design for environments where there s a machine learning engine behind it  By the time we finish this program  that s probably going to be a really hot topic  We re going to spend the next year researching these sorts of things  and we re going to have companies tell us what hot topics they really wish student came out of the program knowing  which we couldn t possibly have known in the past year when we were developing all the curriculum for the program  We can keep it very adaptable and make sure it works  We re going to be getting feedback all the way through  and if we re not producing students that the companies are interested in  we re going to find that out almost immediately  Des  Have you thought about the exact opposite problem  What if everyone gets poached within six months  Jared  That s actually a big problem for us  According to the state of Tennessee  that s technically considered a dropout  even if they are poached and given an amazing salary  It s a weird thing  right  The entire purpose of the Higher Ed Commission  the people who authorize us  is to develop skills  So if we re developing the skills at a faster rate than the program  they re still considered a dropout  We have a political battle to fight there  We re also going to work with the hiring companies so they understand it will be to the student s benefit  to our benefit  and to their benefit if we come up with a way  What we ll probably end up doing when that happens   hopefully it won t happen after six months   is we ll work on a work study program  where they ll actually get credit for work and can finish out their program there  We ll want to make sure the curriculum stays intact  because it s to everyone s benefit that happens  The value of certification Des  The design industry is torn over the issue of certification  Today anyone can be a designer  Basically  you re a designer if you put it in your Twitter bio  We probably have more people saying they re designers than we have designers  On the other side we have folks like yourself who have now produced an entire curriculum that outputs a pretty well defined industry ready designer  Would it be ostentatious for UX design to move to a world of some degree of certification  Jared  I think it s going to happen  When you talk about certification  you have to talk about the experience of certification  Everybody always focuses on the person who s being certified  That s actually not the beneficiary of certification  The real beneficiary of certification is the hiring manager  They are the ones who need to be able to tell whether this person is certified or not   Right now  there is an implied certification that comes with what school you went to  If you know the curriculum of a school and you know that someone has gone through that program and gotten their diploma  then in essence they re certified  They are certified in a way that people who didn t go to the program are not certified  So certification already exists  What we need to talk about is not do we have certification or not have certification  but what do hiring managers really need  One of the things I learned when we were talking to hiring managers is that almost always  they are completely surprised at what students don t know when they come out of school  You get a degree from some institution   let s say it s a Bachelor s degree in information design  or interaction design  or visual design  The students come in and they re given an assignment  and they can t do the basics  They don t know how to do user research  or they don t know how to do other sort of things that everybody assumes  if you re trained as a designer  you would know  The curriculum doesn t ever say that  We realized there s an implied contract between the school and the hiring managers  but no one states what the actual contractual agreement is  the skills we re committed to teaching these students  We create an explicit contract of what it means to be a designer  We met a hiring who loves Carnegie Mellon s program right now  another manager who loves the School of Visual Arts  When we dug a little deeper we learned that was the school they went to  They knew the contract because they had already been through it  We ve decided to make the contract explicit  We ve created competencies  demonstrable skills  for every course  In order for a student to pass the course  they actually have to demonstrate to us that they can do those things  For example  in the user research course students have to observe a usability test  be able to moderate a usability test  design the test plan for the test  recruit participants  and synthesize results  We break all those up into independent competencies  Our full time faculty are basically monitoring the students  progress through the competencies and looking at the upcoming project work and saying   You have a chance to practice your usability testing skills here  Let s have you do the test plan for this project   When they have completed that to the satisfaction of the facilitator they get that checked off  Think of it like merit badges  You have to do all the steps and you get the merit badge  They get to pass the course at that point  We have 30 courses  so there s going to be 30 merit badges  30 sets of competencies  and the competencies start to overlap  When you get to the user research course  because we ve already done sketching and prototyping and we ve already done information architecture  you re going to have to do a usability test of prototypes of navigation of a website  for example  So we start to combine these and demonstrate these  We can publish the list of competencies that every student has to have in order to graduate  and the students can share and specifically speak to the work and how they passed it  That becomes part of their portfolio  We create this explicit contract of what it means to be a designer and what we think it is  The UX Tipping Point Des  The days where you do a podcast about why UX is important are long gone   until you move into the murky field of enterprise software  You wrote recently about how companies need to cross what you call  the UX tipping point   What is the tipping point  What are the stages the larger companies need to go through  Jared  There s a bunch of things that get you there  The evolutionary stages start with what we call the UX dark ages  which is an organization that has never thought about UX  they don t talk about UX  they re about doing the thing they do  They sell gasoline  but they don t think about how people use gasoline  They don t think about how the distributors distribute gasoline  They just sell gasoline  and that s all they think about  It s easy to say   Well  that s not a high tech product  Why do they have UX   That s changing  There s a company I talked to in Alabama that makes water meters  These are little devices that sit on pipes and measure how much water goes through  Your house has one  and chances are your municipality bills you for that  It needs to be accurate  Up until a few years ago that was a purely mechanical device  They never thought about the user experience  You train the people to read the thing  you train the installers to install the thing  That s all the user experience you have to think about  Now these are digital devices  They have software in them  a reading device that actually uses a radio system to talk to it  The person who reads the meter no longer has to come in your house  They can drive by in a truck and it tells them how much water you ve been using  Now they re suddenly finding themselves in the software business  and they re wholly ill equipped to work in the software business  They grew up in a part of Alabama where there are no software people and there are no UX people  So how do they navigate this  They ve gone from being in the dark ages to now needing to think about this  without really knowing anything about it  We call that the spot UX phase  You bring in somebody and they work on UX for a while  and then you send them away  Or maybe you have a manager who drives a UX project until the rest of the organization overtakes them  and then they get fed up and they leave  There s no concerted UX phase  The next stage you see is folks saying   Okay let s get serious  Let s hire designers and therefore create a design team  Therefore we need a design manager  What we ll do is  to serve the whole organization  we will create this internal service  Instead of using outside agencies anymore  we re going to bring that in house and we re going to create this service that basically replicates what the outside agencies were doing for us  but at a much cheaper rate   That s what we call design as a service  It s UX design as a service inside the organization  A lot of people have thought for a long time that was the ultimate evolution  It turns out that as we ve been studying companies  that s not it at all  That s actually a midpoint  The next stage is when a team that the service has been servicing  realizes that design is actually critical to their success  They get frustrated hiring that team for spot pieces as they go  Instead they hire people from the team to actually be embedded in the project  The difference is embedded people only work on that project  They think about multiple releases of that product  Normally design as a service is only thinking about the current release and they are only working on parts of the project  There are whole parts that they have nothing to do with and no control over and know influence over  The designers now have influence over this  For some people they thought  okay well that was sort of the end  It turns out that it s not  There could be something after this   where the designers aren t the only ones designing  Everybody on the team is now thinking of themselves as a UX person  The example I like to give is Netflix  There are people who are in charge of making sure that the bits come off the server as fast as possible  They worry about responsiveness and bandwidth and reliability  They re typically engineers  and their job is to make the servers and the network perform as fast as it can  Conventionally  we would never have referred to them as UX people  They don t have anything to do with UX  They work on the back end  The moment you re watching your favorite movie and the little spinner starts to spin  and your movie stops and nothing happens  suddenly they re UX people  They are the most important UX people on the team in that moment  The last stage is what we call a design infused organization  where everybody sees themselves as a UX person  The performance engineers  the product managers  the lawyers who create the license agreements  everybody has some influence over the user experience and is actively working to provide the best user experience possible  It s that organization where we see the UX tipping point  You actually use design to hold up your product  The UX tipping point is a moment that happens when you go  away  from having the conventional approach of shipping a product at the very moment that it s technically capable of doing what we want it to do and meets the business model   If it does those two things we ship it  We don t worry if the design isn t great  we ll fix it in the next release   This has been Microsoft s MO for three decades  The old joke is that Microsoft s user experience doesn t get good until the third release  because for the first two releases they just get it out there and working  That s been the convention  The tipping point is when you stop shipping products  not because it technically doesn t work or the business model isn t met  but because it s not designed well enough for your standards  You actually use design to hold up your product  There aren t a lot of companies that have reached this tipping point  The ones who have met this are producing a much higher grade of product  As a result  they command higher revenues  they command higher prices  and they get more customer loyalty  They win on all the factors  Design is really the last ground to compete on  Technology is an even bar  You can get all the technology you want and most of it is in the cloud  You can come out with the cheapest product  but cheap doesn t give you a lot of margin  Competition can come up with something cheaper  which means you have to lower your prices  So you re always in this game of seeing who can drive their costs down  You can produce the highest quality product  but reliability  maintainability  those sorts of things are now basic stakes  So what s left  The user experience  Being able to compete on a user experience,"[1167 1137 75 1388 274 808 434 1322 145 479 785]"
1197,training-dataset/product/899.txt,product,Ways We WorkCooper s processes have largely developed and evolved around this concept of co creation and the gen and synth relationship  For example  war rooms grew out the team s desire to work more efficiently and cut down on the time between going away to design and having to come back to compare notes  The practice of war rooms came about organically  Brendan explained that they would often host clients in conference rooms for a day or two  and camp out working on the project  It turns out that proximity ended up being very productive  So the practice of working together in a war room became crucial  naturally encouraging this co creation process between designers  Regardless of the tools being used on a project  the gen designer is generating ideas in real time  and talking through them so that the synth designer has something to respond to  This environment  where the project lives inside this shared space  facilitates this way of working and supports the gen synth relationship   Although design pairs tend work together for a few projects  they make a point to change up teams regularly when the project schedule permits  It means that designers stay fresh and get a range of experience working with different skill sets and abilities  It also helps make sure that a pair doesn t get so comfortable together that they lean on each other too much for things they should both be doing  Lauren added that this  break up  can sometimes be a little difficult having developed such a close working relationship  but this practice of swapping pairs on a regular basis has been crucial to how Cooper evolves  If a new tool or a new process works well with one pair  often it will get passed on in the next team  This helps make the adoption of new tools and new ways of working more iterative and natural   In addition to the gen synth designer relationship and co creating inside war rooms  there are two main things that Cooper is known for  the Goal Directed design methodology and the use of persona development within that  Personas are formed by the designers from the discovery and research phases of the project and come directly from user interviews  which are highly specific and defined  Communicating the value of the discovery and research phases to the client early on  is another key element  so that the client understands why they might not be seeing screens or visual designs right away  We saw examples of these personas inside one project s war room  it listed the persona s name  background  and specific motivations and goals  These goals become the litmus test for everything throughout the course of the project  This ensures that the conversation isn t around tasks or features or even functions  but instead how the product will meet each persona s goals  Lauren gave an example   A goal might be traveling  so if you re traveling from coast to coast  someone s goal isn t to buy an airplane ticket  Their goal is to get from point A to point B safely and efficiently  and that s something that can stand the test of time   Framing the product through the eyes of these personas and their goals helps both the designers and the client stay away from deciding things based on their personal preferences  Of course  they still get pushback from clients from time to time  but personas help frame the conversation because they are well defined and agreed upon before any detailed building starts,"[1197 867 1388 543 387 573 717 67 145 1291 271]"
1230,training-dataset/product/1277.txt,product,Giving depth to your UX research with business intelligenceIn the digital age  the systems development life cycle  SDLC  is virtually unavoidable  While every phase works in harmony to produce a refined  calculated result  how important is anything after research   Of course  I m exaggerating  But when was the last time you stopped to appreciate the research phase  Think about it  every single phase of the SDLC is rooted in the results procured during the UX research phase   Interface design  development  and even quality assurance testing are all merely instruments to be used for the purpose of achieving the goals set forth by the individuals responsible for business intelligence and UX research   When it comes to UX research  no 2 processes are the same   At Codal  our particular brand of UX research overlaps quite a bit with  discovery  the process of identifying and analyzing business goals and requirements  Since research and discovery are typically done in succession  we collectively term the process business intelligence   UX designers have 2 goals  help the user  and help the business  It s easy to get caught up in what the user may want  and in the process  forget about what s best for the business that hired you   So  without further adieu  here s how our UX researchers ensure that business goals are always at the forefront of the design process   Follow a business first approach to research  What does a business first approach to research look like  Consider the following process   Identify relevant business project goals Perform a competitive analysis Obtain information from about real users Data synthesis and analysis Establish design guidelines During QA  identify any BI miscommunication  Take note that 3 of the 6 steps are directly related to business goals  while only one of the steps  number 3  is directly related to user research  Hopefully  this illustrates the importance of aligning the UX strategy with the business goals of our clientele   Collect user data and business data  Data  data  data it s on every researcher s mind   The question is  which data   The answer to that question varies from project to project  but it usually looks something like this   What does the business need  What do the users need  How can we balance the 2   Seems simple enough  but the hardest part is actually collecting the data  There are as many ways of collecting data as there are people collecting it  At Codal  we use a number of data collection methods  but we ve distilled them down to a few of our favorites   Collect user data with   Focus groups  Surveys interviews  Contextual inquiry  Obtain define business requirements through   Stakeholder interviews  Business model canvas  Competitive analysis  Any UX designer worth their mettle ought to know the data collection methods outlined in group one it s the standard spread of tools used by most UX researchers  I d bet  however  that there are a few UX designers researchers out there who have placed significantly less emphasis on the practices outlined in the second group   Let s dive a bit deeper   Stakeholder interviews  business model canvases  and competitive analyses are all conducted to ensure that the needs of the business receive just as much attention as the needs of the user   Stakeholder interviews are designed to gauge the precise metrics that are important to the people who call the shots  business owners  investors  and the like   Business model canvases  on the other hand  are visual representations of the business model  how it works  and why the business is structured the way it is   Competitive analyses are in depth reports on the features and experiences offered by competitors of the client  These can be as simple or complex as they need to be   Brienne Moore  one of Codal s UX researchers  is a strong proponent of the business model canvas technique  Here s what she told me    Doing a business model canvas helps ensure that we understand the real needs of the client  Understanding what a client wants can only get you so far  But understanding the deeper  why  is where you can really design for innovation and step up the success of the project    Conclusion   User  experience isn t just for users  UX researchers  remember  your job isn t just to design the best possible experience for users you re also responsible for the direct impact of your design on the business  once your research has been used to make it   Sometimes  user and business can be too much for one team to take on  Don t hesitate to allocate different UX researchers to the user and business sides of the research  It could help you in the long run as long as the 2 communicate adequately,"[1230 1259 1322 75 1388 873 145 341 479 434 1137]"
1240,training-dataset/business/1447.txt,business,A designer s guide to Parkinson s Law of TrivialityA designer s guide to Parkinson s Law of Triviality  What to do when your team is focused on unimportant details  Last week  I met with two companies that are building incredibly complex  ambitious medical products  One of the companies is trying to fundamentally improve cancer outcomes in a way that could save millions of lives  The other company is trying to eliminate an entire class of diseases   not improve treatment  not cure a specific disease  but to eliminate a whole set of diseases  Wow   I m a pretty experienced designer  so when I talked to these companies  leaders I expected to discuss the complexities of their product design challenges  Instead  the first company wanted to talk about what shade of carpet they should choose for their new office and the other company wanted me to work with them to improve their PowerPoint master template   Wait  what   These companies aren t ignorant about the power of design  My team at GV has worked with them before and previously we worked on big  strategic projects  So  why were they focusing on such surface level design challenges this time around   Back in 1957  a guy named C  Northcote Parkinson observed that people often give disproportionate focus to trivial projects at work  As an example  Parkinson described a team that is creating a nuclear power plant  During the planning stages  a big debate breaks out about the design of the shed where employees will park their bicycles  Instead of arguing about the details of power mechanisms  cooling systems  or waste fuel storage  it seems like everyone s focus is on what material should be used for the bike shed roof   And  no wonder  At work  you re expected to have intelligent opinions and propose smart solutions to problems  But  when you re working on something that is very complex  it s intimidating and exhausting to have opinions on the biggest challenges  It s so easy to focus your attention on the issues that are easy to grok and which won t  literally  blow up in your face if you re wrong  So  it s understandable that people schedule meetings about the roof of the bike shed so that they can voice their opinions and feel useful and heard   This idea became known as Parkinson s Law of Triviality or  bikeshedding  and there s an excellent Wikipedia article that explains it in more depth if you re curious  So  now that you ve got a name for the phenomenon  what can you do about it when everyone is breathing down your neck about the carpet color or the PowerPoint design   Here are the key things I ve found that help when people start bikeshedding   Embrace the attention  Be patient and look on the bright side  Wow  everyone is suddenly focused on your little corner of the world  Sure  it can be frustrating when many people voices their opinions  often unasked for  but it s also your chance to shine on a project of perceived importance  Grab this opportunity by the horns and keep your frustration under check  Try to embrace the mindset that every project is important   even the PowerPoint deck or the choice of carpet color  You have everyone s attention and if you can pull the team together and choose a great roof for this particular bike shed  they re going to be thrilled with you   Listen carefully  If you re the designer who is responsible for the project  the first thing you need to do is take the time to listen to everyone else  We know what s driving this sudden interest in a seemingly trivial project  people feel overwhelmed by a different  complex issue and your project has become an escape valve  In some ways you re now a therapist  Listening and accepting input is valuable in itself because you re offering people an outlet  And remember  just because people offer direction and advice doesn t mean you have to do everything they suggest  so take the time to absorb everyone s contributions   Ensure that people feel heard  This is the most important part  It s not good enough to just listen to people  you also need to make sure they know they were heard  This is part of your role as a designer therapist  I ll repeat what I said earlier  you shouldn t necessarily literally do what people suggest  But  when you choose Franklin Gothic for those PowerPoint titles  explain where this decision came from and show how people s feedback helped you reach this choice  Your teammates will feel like you ve accomplished something important together  even if you personally feel like the project is a distraction   Timebox the project  Setting a deadline for your  bike shed  project has two benefits  First  it will help you spend an appropriate amount of time on the project  You ll get the job done but quickly move on to more important efforts  And second  a deadline can actually produce better results  We ve seen again and again how time pressure helps teams create great solutions together   Gently refocus people s passion  It s often really difficult to redirect people s focus back onto larger problem  but sometimes it is possible  One way to be successful is to lean in and work on the hard problem yourself  Of course  you may not be qualified to make decisions on something as complex as a nuclear power plant s power supply systems  but you may be able to step in as a facilitator to help move that decision making process along in a healthy way  Now that the big  tough issue is unlocked and moving ahead  people will hopefully turn their focus away from your simpler project   And  in the end  it s often simply helpful to have a name and an explanation for things  The next time you re caught leading a 2 hour meeting about fabric samples  you ll be that person who laughs knowingly  we re bikeshedding here  people,"[1240 1322 573 1137 867 717 1079 145 543 305 510]"
1259,training-dataset/product/1108.txt,product,What is user research This is an excerpt from Principles of UX Design  an InVision e course by Timothy Embretson   User research is the act of interviewing prospective and actual users of your products to gain clarity on a number of objectives  You might use it to figure out why people aren t adding recommended products to a cart  why they re not clicking through your emails on mobile phone  or why adoption of your application has fallen significantly   You may also be developing a new product or redesigning a website and know you want to do it differently this time around  All of these are great reasons to let your users tell you how they feel about your product   Conducting user research is just one part of the equation  Afterwards  you have to act on that feedback to make new product decisions or enhancements  Depending on your role in the project  you may not agree with some of the feedback  If this is the case  remember that you re not the end user  Your day is likely consumed with interacting with the website or application  which isn t representative of a typical user s usage   Check your ego and accept that changes need to be made  It s not bad it just is   The information in the remainder of this chapter will give you a glimpse into the basics of user research and testing  Though it s not an in depth how to on conducting user research  it ll give you broad insight into the types of user research methods so you can incorporate user research into your project timelines   Research driven product model  The goal should be to engage users to drive business and digital product decisions and strategy  You shouldn t wait to engage them post launch in a reactive  defensive mode when adoption is low  abandon rates are high  and revenue is disappearing   Buy why  Business has been conducted this way for decades  Companies tell users and consumers why they need to buy their product  They ve been told what they should eat  what car they should buy  and even which deodorant to use   Companies should have conversations with their consumers and users  The advent of internet reviews and social media word of mouth has radically upended this one directional conversation  There are countless case studies about various brands  poor responses to reviews and failed grassroots social media efforts   Users are merciless when it comes to telling their friends and networks about a subpar product or service  There s immense power in that  and you can harness this through proactive  positive user research to avoid potential disasters later   What does this look like  and how is it done  Reach out early  ask often  and always listen  UX isn t UX without research  after all   The model above illustrates both a research driven product approach layered on top of a very simplified product development model  It can be as simple as inserting insight research prior to making any business or product decisions   What do your users think of the current product  What features do they think are missing  Would they change anything  Conducting these interviews and subsequently creating personas helps ensure you re harnessing user feedback in the best possible way   Types of user research methods  The following research methods outline 5 different methods for starting those conversations  This list isn t meant to be exhaustive it ll cover the basics   Before we jump in  let s define a few terms   Facilitator  user research professional who plans and executes the research  gathers feedback  and reports all of that back to the project team  Participant  a user who s part of the research process  Recruiting  the act of locating your product s users to conduct a research test  Compensation  users are usually compensated for their time as a participant  Usability lab  a traditional lab where tests are conducted  There are typically 2 rooms separated by a 2 way mirror for observation purposes   User interviews  User interviews are the keystone of user research  grounding all additional approaches  methodologies  and deliverables in the act of conducting an actual conversation with your users  They can take place in traditional usability labs  remote via phone or web based video  or the place in which your users typically engage with your digital product  This could be an airport  retail store  personal home  or a medical clinic  to name some examples   Interviews can range from multi week planned events to guerrilla style interviews based on just minutes or hours of planning  This flexibility is key depending on the UX maturity of your organization and the funding available   Usability test  A usability test is conducted to validate an in progress concept or a live product currently being used  or to drive UX changes after analytics and feedback indicate a usability problem  This research can take place in a traditional usability lab or on location as part of a contextual inquiry   A standard usability test involves specific tasks and will usually be tightly scripted in order to pinpoint specific issues  Facilitators can follow up with probing questions to dive into more detail  Participants will be encouraged to  think aloud  as they describe their thoughts about navigating through the tasks  Feedback tends to be more accurate and relevant because users are asked to state the first thing that pops into their head  Let participants think deeply about their responses  and they could edit them  That skews feedback   Contextual inquiry  A contextual inquiry is conducted to understand how users interact with a product  or a prototype of a new product  in the exact setting it ll be used  So it likely won t happen in a usability lab  Locations can range from participants  homes  retail environments  airports or train stations  classrooms  medical offices  and more  This type of research can involve more planning and perhaps a higher cost due to the variations on recruiting and compensation   A contextual inquiry can also be a usability test with the added research including how different settings change users  perceptions and feedback   Imagine you re testing a point of sale system  Feedback could vary greatly depending on whether it s being used in the aisle of a retail location versus at a hot  crowded summer festival   Depending on the type of feedback desired  the facilitator can simply observe users taking notes on the entire application  Or specific tasks can be defined to gain specific clarity  If the latter is employed  additional research may be required to follow up on specific tasks   User experience competitive user analysis  A user experience competitive analysis is conducted to understand how your users are also using your competitors  products  If the product you re launching will be part of a crowded field  use your competitors  websites and applications to learn what works and what doesn t  Learning from these users and identifying mental models will help you capitalize on things done well and avoid potentially fatal mistakes   A UX competitive analysis differs from more traditional competitive analysis that s rooted solely in documenting data such as competitor offerings  market share  and strategy   Heuristic and expert analysis evaluation  A heuristic or expert analysis is conducted to evaluate a website or application against agreed upon design principles  User research and user experience professionals evaluate the system and gather issues  Those issues are then classified to what principle it violates and are assigned criticality to give direction to the team   Because these types of research activities don t typically involve users  they can be conducted when there s no budget available to recruit users for a larger scale test  Even though users aren t always engaged  it s best to have researchers who are familiar with your users conduct these evaluations so they can focus on known issue areas  Additionally  typically a group of 2 3 professionals conduct the analysis to ensure as many issues as possible are uncovered   A heuristic can also be used as a precursor to almost any other methodology  meaning that by evaluating a system to find usability problems you can inform interviews  usability tests  and more   Additional methods  There are a number of additional types of research that can be employed depending on the need and maturity of your organization   A B testing  Surveys  in person  email  web based  etc    Click analysis  Eye tracking  Diary studies  Focus groups  Task time studies  Types of user research deliverables  These deliverables focus on what the business team can expect from a research resource   Test plan  The test plan represents the culmination of planning for your research effort  The gathering of this information should be collaborative and involve interviews with stakeholders and subject matter experts   Collaboration isn t absent from this process  All parties should have ample time to review the document to ensure they re comfortable with the approach   Objectives  What do you want out of the research effort   Methodology  How are you going to gather insight   Participants  Who are you gathering insight from   Outline  What will the flow of the session be   Test environment  Where will the research will take place   Project schedule  When can you expect the research to take place  when will initial results be available  and when will the full report be delivered   Findings report  After the research effort is complete  a research findings report should be delivered to synthesize and report common insights  Types of documents delivered will depend on the methodology used  but you can expect a document that contains data  quotes  photos  videos  and enhancement recommendations   As a follow up to the test plan  all items listed above should be included to ensure everyone on the team is aware of how this feedback was gathered   Takeaways  UX isn t UX without user research  Insight research should be conducted prior to product decisions being made

1291,training-dataset/product/429.txt,product,Lessons learned from building a side projectAt some point  we ve all thought about having a piece of the product world a project we can t wait to work on every day  With a side project you rely on your own experience and make your own judgment calls  You re in charge of your ideas and you gain skills along the way as you push ideas beyond doodles on a napkin   Set apart from your daily routine  a side project can motivate and excite you  For me  the thrill comes from being able to experiment and give back to the community  But from having an idea to promoting it to the right audience  side projects involve a whole lot of hard work  This article covers the lessons I learned while building UX Recipe in my free time and releasing its iOS app   UX Recipe is a checklist where you discover  choose  and estimate your next tools and techniques  You can use UX Recipe 3 ways   Create your own process for your product or UX project Estimate the hours and costs for each item in your process and calculate the total Explore a curated list of recommendations  Each item comes with its definition and a collection of useful links  This way the team and the client know from the start what  how  and how much   I started this project on my own because I felt people were under developing the term  UX   It s not UI and it s not a fancy word to attach to a resume  Moreover  UX isn t a magic ingredient you add to get users to start pouring in   Take a roadmap with you  I knew from the start what I was going to launch as a first prototype and I stuck with that plan until it happened  This way  I didn t allow myself to extend deadlines  add features  or take the bait to every opinion  It s not easy to be that strict  but it helps  Treating a side project like client work helps you avoid the I ll do it tomorrow effect  It s easy to postpone deadlines when there are no ground rules   Something I did to push myself forward  I kept a tight schedule and published work online as soon as possible  I also shared the project with acquaintances to put some pressure on myself  Failure is educational  but it stings when it happens before an audience   Build a roadmap for every version you intend to release  Of course  from one release to another  your project might need changes  A distraction free design sprint can do wonders   2  Offer outcome  not output  One of the best parts of UX Recipe is its content  Users resonated with UX Recipe s manifesto thanks to its casual and witty tone of voice  Add to this a curated list of resources and the ability to estimate your project  and it was more than a calculator   After analyzing feedback and going through the recordings  I noticed something  People returned for its value  not for the numbers  Either they were promoting it with the same tone or using it as a discovery tool  Collecting and grouping the information paid off   Emphasize the value proposition you offer  not just a batch of features  Users might return for what you stand for and be part of your mission on a long turn  and that s a major win   3  Prototype  prototype  prototype  When you re working on a side project  time is of the essence  It was clear that I needed to put something online if I wanted to test it fast  After finalizing the content  I moved to prototyping in HTML CSS JS  I published it all using Github pages  fixed the obvious bugs  and started asking for feedback   Whether you use HTML  InVision  or paper  you should create a prototype  You ll experiment  record quick ideas  make mistakes sooner  and communicate better  For example  from the beginning I shared my project on Github  It was online all the time  allowing me to add small updates and test features   4  It s not a solo job  At a certain point you ll realize you need help  I wanted an iOS app  but I didn t know Xcode  I wanted to promote the project  but I didn t know all the marketing tools  tips  and tricks   So then I wanted an Android app  Would I build it myself  No  Would I ask for help  Yes   I was lucky  The project attracted passionate people who wanted to contribute  They showed interest due to the nature of the project  Also  I offered the code on Github and that made things even easier  Developers  both strangers and friends  optimized my code just to help out   A colleague started to work on the iOS app just so he could practice his Xcode skills  A friend offered to help with marketing and analytics  And a friend of a friend who happens to be an Android developer started building the Android version   Even the company I work for  Grapefruit  supported me  There s no shame in admitting you feel overwhelmed  and there s no harm in asking for help   You might be an awesome designer or developer  but you re not a unicorn  They don t exist   5  Learn to promote  There s more to promotion than paid ads  One thing I got wrong from the beginning  relying on promoted ads  They help  but they don t get you near users   With the right guidance  I started learning more advanced features from Google Analytics  I understood my audience better where they re coming from and their interests  I planned my posts on social media and tracked the conversation  I learned that to get lucky on DesignerNews  you should post at 9am Pacific time   6  Patience is a virtue  I daydreamed a lot about the end result I always imagined how the product would look after launch and how it d grow  Then I realized I hadn t even tweeted about the project or asked for feedback   Every time I tweeted about it  nothing happened  No visits  no retweets  nothing  Don t build something because you want it to go viral   I knew getting the project out there would be tricky and time consuming  but not impossible  So I started small with tweets  likes  and conversations on various groups  At first there was little to no activity or response  but I kept going   There was a boost of motivation every once in a while  The project got picked up by Product Hunt  sent via Sidebar  and shared by Smashing Magazine  From there other sites started to promote it   7  Listen  measure  and react  The fun doesn t stop when you launch a product it just puts you in front of the unexpected   I used Trello to save all the feedback and ideas I got  grouping them into columns for Critical  To do  Nice to have  and Nope   I also mixed various tools to keep track of users  behavior and patterns  I used Google Analytics  Hotjar  and Fabric  Users started to report bugs and errors  so I needed to play the role of a support team  Once you release a project brace yourself you ll discover skills you never knew you had   8  Keep an eye on the competition  As the saying goes  you are not alone so get to know your competition  I often verify how other checklist tools are evolving  I m always curious to see if someone else tried similar or new features   9  Move forward when you re stuck  After UX Recipe s web prototype release and its promotion boost  things calmed down and nothing really happened for a while  I got so comfortable that updates became rare  And for months  I just relied on visits from referrals   It was only when I decided to prepare the iOS app that things started to move again  With the iOS app released  updates are often submitted  Small or big  it doesn t count that much as long as there s traction and activity  The iOS app s release also motivated me to stay on track with the Android version  I planned again in advance  refined the roadmap  and promised myself to not let things slip again   10  There s no time like free time  As long as you don t quit your day job  a side project will stay a side project  Working on it full time just won t happen it took me some time to get used to this   What did I do   I planned my weekends in advance I scheduled my weekday nights Organized hackathons for complex features  This way I pressured myself to work on a

1313,training-dataset/product/1119.txt,product,The words you use to attract clients on the webVirtually every freelancer uses confusing terms to describe their work  Just try explaining one of the terms below to a normal person   Chances are you lose their attention in the first 10 seconds   So with that in mind  why use these words to describe your service to clients  Most of them aren t even clear to people in the industry   UX design  That s debatable   Brand design  What s a brand    NET development  Whaty what now   Using these terms  you re disconnecting yourself from what you re really selling  Instead of selling the benefits of working with you  you re trying to just sell the thing you do  The problem is no one wants to buy that thing  They want to buy the result that thing will bring for them   For example  take another common phrase people use   I create  desirable skill specific term  for small businesses   Typically  it s used like this   I create beautiful websites for small businesses   I create intuitive user interfaces for small businesses   I create fast web apps for small businesses   I create attention grabbing copy for small businesses   These all may seem like reasonable ways to describe a service  But take a closer look  Who s the real star in all of these  You  You re talking about what YOU do  What makes YOU good  Why YOU are great at what you do   What about your clients   The only place where you  briefly  mention them  you re calling them small  In business that s almost derogatory  They don t want to be small they want to be big  At least they want their revenue to be big   So why again are you taking this approach   If you had to flip one of these positioning statements to instead focus on your clients  you might say   I create simple interfaces for great iPhone apps that want to reach the next level inside the app store   or  I create marketing graphics that make great companies stand out even more for their brilliant content   or  I create tight web apps for amazing software companies that want to deliver the best product to their customers and improve retention   All of these revised positioning statements take the emphasis away from you and shifts it to the clients  A client wants a better version of themself  It s not about the skill you have  It s not about the service you re selling it s about the results  It s about how you re valuable to your great clients  That s all that matters   People are looking to pay for an outcome  They want results  They want a problem to go away   So remember  You re not just a UI designer  You re not just any one skill  You have clients  You make their life better because of what your UI design does for their business  That s what matters   Ryan Singer  Designer at Basecamp  said it best   There s no rule that says you need to describe what you re doing in one word    You don t have to reduce yourself down to a one word specialty to describe what you do  Not just because it s hard  but also because it doesn t work anyway   A great place to test out this new positioning concept  your email signature  How can you write a short statement that attracts clients  I collected 5 top notch email signatures by world class freelance consultants that you can download by going here   This post was originally published on Medium,"[1313 166 604 1094 387 1137 867 808 489 1167 434]"
1322,training-dataset/product/1084.txt,product,UX Research Cheat SheetSummary  User research can be done at any point in the design cycle  This list of methods and activities can help you decide which to use when   User experience research methods are great at producing data and insights  while ongoing activities help get the right things done  Alongside R D  ongoing UX activities can make everyone s efforts more effective and valuable  At every stage in the design process  different UX methods can keep product development efforts on the right track  in agreement with true user needs and not imaginary ones   One of the questions we get the most is   When should I do user research on my project   There are three different answers   Do user research at whatever stage you re in right now   The earlier the research  the more impact the findings will have on your product  and by definition  the earliest you can do something on your current project  absent a time machine  is today     The earlier the research  the more impact the findings will have on your product  and by definition  the earliest you can do something on your current project  absent a time machine  is today  Do user research at all the stages   As we show below  there s something useful to learn in every single stage of any reasonable project plan  and each research step will increase the value of your product by more than the cost of the research     As we show below  there s something useful to learn in every single stage of any reasonable project plan  and each research step will increase the value of your product by more than the cost of the research  Do most user research early in the project  when it ll have the most impact   but conserve some budget for a smaller amount of supplementary research later in the project  This advice applies in the common case that you can t get budget for all the research steps that would be useful   The chart below describes UX methods and activities available in various project stages   Each project is different  so the stages are not always neatly compartmentalized  The end of one cycle is the beginning of the next   The important thing is not to execute a giant list of activities in rigid order  but to start somewhere and learn more and more as you go along   Top UX Research Methods Discover   Field study    Diary study    User interview    Stakeholder interview    Requirements   constraints gathering Explore   Competitive analysis    Design review    Persona building    Task analysis    Journey mapping    Prototype feedback   testing  clickable or paper prototypes     Write user stories    Card sorting Test   Qualitative usability testing  in person or remote     Benchmark testing    Accessibility evaluation Listen   Survey    Analytics review    Search log analysis    Usability bug review    Frequently asked questions  FAQ  review  When deciding where to start or what to focus on first  use some of these top UX methods  Some methods may be more appropriate than others  depending on time constraints  system maturity  type of product or service  and the current top concerns  It s a good idea to use different or alternating methods each product cycle because they are aimed at different goals and types of insight  The chart below shows how often UX practitioners reported engaging in these methods in our survey on UX careers   If you can do only one activity and aim to improve an existing system  do qualitative  think aloud  usability testing  which is the most effective method to improve usability  If you are unable to test with users  analyze as much user data as you can  Data  obtained  for instance  from call logs  searches  or analytics  is not a great substitute for people  however  because data usually tells you what  but you often need to know why  So use the questions your data brings up to continue to push for usability testing   Discover  The discovery stage is when you try to illuminate what you don t know and better understand what people need  It s especially important to do discovery activities before making a new product or feature  so you can find out whether it makes sense to do the project at all   An important goal at this stage is to validate and discard assumptions  and then bring the data and insights to the team  Ideally this research should be done before effort is wasted on building the wrong things or on building things for the wrong people  but it can also be used to get back on track when you re working with an existing product or service   Good things to do during discovery   Conduct field studies and interview users  Go where the users are  watch  ask  and listen  Observe people in context interacting with the system or solving the problems you re trying to provide solutions for   Run diary studies to understand your users  information needs and behaviors   Interview stakeholders to gather and understand business requirements and constraints   Interview sales  support  and training staff  What are the most frequent problems and questions they hear from users  What are the worst problems people have  What makes people angry   Listen to sales and support calls  What do people ask about  What do they have problems understanding  How do the sales and support staff explain and help  What is the vocabulary mismatch between users and staff   Do competitive testing  Find the strengths and weaknesses in your competitors  products  Discover what users like best   Explore  Exploration methods are for understanding the problem space and design scope and addressing user needs appropriately   Compare features against competitors   Do design reviews   Use research to build user personas and write user stories   Analyze user tasks to find ways to save people time and effort   Show stakeholders the user journey and where the risky areas are for losing customers along the way  Decide together what an ideal user journey would look like   Explore design possibilities by imagining many different approaches  brainstorming  and testing the best ideas in order to identify best of breed design components to retain   Obtain feedback on early stage task flows by walking through designs with stakeholders and subject matter experts  Ask for written reactions and questions  silent brainstorming   to avoid groupthink and to enable people who might not speak up in a group to tell you what concerns them   Iterate designs by testing paper prototypes with target users  and then test interactive prototypes by watching people use them  Don t gather opinions  Instead  note how well designs work to help people complete tasks and avoid errors  Let people show you where the problem areas are  then redesign and test again   Use card sorting to find out how people group your information  to help inform your navigation and information organization scheme   Test  Testing and validation methods are for checking designs during development and beyond  to make sure systems work well for the people who use them   Do qualitative usability testing  Test early and often with a diverse range of people  alone and in groups  Conduct an accessibility evaluation to ensure universal access   Ask people to self report their interactions and any interesting incidents while using the system over time  for example with diary studies   Audit training classes and note the topics  questions people ask  and answers given  Test instructions and help systems   Talk with user groups   Staff social media accounts and talk with users online  Monitor social media for kudos and complaints   Analyze user forum posts  User forums are sources for important questions to address and answers that solve problems  Bring that learning back to the design and development team   Do benchmark testing  If you re planning a major redesign or measuring improvement  test to determine time on task  task completion  and error rates of your current system  so you can gauge progress over time   Listen  Listen throughout the research and design cycle to help understand existing problems and to look for new issues  Analyze gathered data and monitor incoming information for patterns and trends   Survey customers and prospective users   Monitor analytics and metrics to discover trends and anomalies and to gauge your progress   Analyze search queries  What do people look for and what do they call it  Search logs are often overlooked  but they contain important information   Make it easy to send in comments  bug reports  and questions  Analyze incoming feedback channels periodically for top usability issues and trouble areas  Look for clues about what people can t find  their misunderstandings  and any unintended effects   Collect frequently asked questions and try to solve the problems they represent   Run booths at conferences that your customers and users attend so that they can volunteer information and talk with you directly   Give talks and demos  capture questions and concerns   Activities  Discover  Ongoing and strategic activities can help you get ahead of problems and make systemic improvements   Find allies

1337,training-dataset/product/1167.txt,product,Validating concepts quickly and efficientlyHere at Engine Digital  getting to the  right  concept quickly is critical for our clients and our agency  It s important because it reduces budgetary risk and it allows the team to focus on the right things  It also increases the probability that the project will meet business and user objectives   To increase our concepting speed  we started using the Google Ventures  GV  sprint process  A typical GV sprint consists of 5 stages  Map  Sketch  Decide  Prototype  and Test   Related  Go inside design at Google Ventures  This post is about our  Test Day  experience  We ll review what we found most useful in the context of remote moderated testing   Evaluating concepts  Let s imagine that you and your team have just finished creating a prototype  It looks and feels like the  real thing   It represents your team s best efforts to solve a client s problem or need  Your team has a lot of confidence in the solution but your client has some doubts   Who s right  Will it work   The only reliable way to test a concept  put it in front of the people who will actually use it  Testing your concept with real users immediately reveals what works and what doesn t  Test data helps you and your client cut through subjective opinions and trivial feedback   Real world test results keep agencies and clients honest and goal focused  Tests take take time and effort  so we try to squeeze out as much insight goodness from each session  We do this by involving the entire team on test day   Learning together  Test day is all about giving up control and letting concepts stand on their own  Having our entire multidisciplinary team take part on test day creates a shared foundation  The team draws upon this understanding again and again throughout a project  It also allows the team to step away from their work  and look at it objectively   The steps on test day are pretty simple   Prepare the observation room Gather the team Contact the participant and start the test Listen  observe  take notes Wrap up test session and discuss as a team  On test day  we step away from our usual work routines  There s anticipation  surprise  validation  high fiving and sometimes facepalms  Here are some comments from a recent test session    Nobody found the testimonials important  They didn t even look at them  Unexpected     David  Senior Content Strategist   Most of the instructors seem to use 13 inch Windows laptops     Bryan  Lead Developer   The book cover is very important for instructors  Our client s hunch was right     Ryan  VP of User Experience   It was interesting that he couldn t find the NEXT button  It s right there     Pawel  Designer  We definitely learn a lot by watching as a group  But sometimes observations aren t enough to understand what s wrong  When it isn t clear why users are having difficulty  the moderator asks clarifying questions   Communicating with participants  With remote testing  asking users probing questions can be challenging    Can you click the NEXT button     Test moderator   What NEXT button     Participant   It s towards the right of screen  beside the book image     Test moderator   I don t see it     Participant   It s on the right side  it s right there  beside the book     Test moderator   Hmmm   I don t see it  Am I doing something wrong     Participant  To avoid situations like this  we often use InVision LiveShare when sharing prototypes  LiveShare is a team collaboration tool  but the features work well for remote testing  For instance  with LiveShare  participants can see our mouse and we can see their mouse    Can you click the NEXT button  I m circling it with my mouse     Test moderator   I see it  I didn t think it was clickable     Participant   Good point  We ll make sure our designer makes it more obvious     Test moderator  LiveShare also has presenter control allowing the moderator to orchestrate the test session  For voice communication the tool offers a choice between VOIP and conference line  To record sessions we use Lookback  but we try to make most of our observations in real time   During the test session everyone observes and takes notes on Post it notes  An observation can be something good  bad  or simply interesting  Magic happens when these notes are placed on the observation wall   The observation wall  Taking and organizing notes as a group is hard unless you use the observation wall  The observation wall is a grid consisting of 5 columns and a handful or rows  The columns represent test participants  and the rows represent tasks  Ideally  the grid is drawn on a large whiteboard   As tests progress  the wall fills in with Post it observations taken by the entire team  The steady march of Post it notes populate 1 column at a time  After each test  we review the notes as a group and identify patterns and show stoppers  At the end of the day  we review and identify the primary problems and opportunities as a group  Analysis and next steps are quick because everyone understands the issues as they happen   Summary  It doesn t take much effort to get useful design feedback  In just a day  you can validate concepts with real users and see what works and what doesn t   Including all core team members in test sessions is critical  Seeing something first hand is way more powerful than being told about it  Testing removes subjectivity  allowing the design team and client to make informed  goal oriented  decisions   Keep reading about

1388,training-dataset/product/670.txt,product,the things every product team should doAfter working with many product teams in small and big companies  I collected the most important things you have to do while you build a digital product  This is the UX Minimum Checklist  It can help you to start building a design culture in your organization  It is not perfect  But still  it is a good startig point and a checklist for anyone  So does your team fit the minimum requirements     1  Weekly user tests  Getting frequent user feedback is an essential part of building any product  You need it when you design something and iterate on different prototypes  You need it when you want to find out what problems to solve next  And you need it when something is ready to be shipped  With having at least one user test a week  you can maintain a close relationship with your users  So you can be sure  the important insights will find their way to your team  Have at least one user test every week and you can check the first item of the UX Minimum Checklist   2  Regular product discovery  Testing your product or prototype is cool  but you also need to come up with new feature or product ideas  In other words you should have a systematic way of doing product discovery  The goal is to find your audience s pains and needs and come up with new ideas to solve them  You can do regular interviews  field research  experience sampling  diary study or competitor analysis  Some companies have dedicated discovery teams  But you don t necessary need that  You can do mini discovery interviews before every user test  Or just choose a method from the list and do it in every second month   3  Prototype first  When you build a new product or a new feature you should build a prototype first  A prototype is a low fidelity clickable wireframe  It s easy and fun to create them  If you don t feel embarrassed of your proto  you have spent too much time with it  The goal is to test this early prototype with people and get important feedback  Later every change will cost you precious developement time  So it s better to find those problems early   4  Measure usage  have numbers  You can start with the most basic things  like installing Analytics and Hotjar  If you want to track users one by one  Mixpanel can be a good choice  More advanced teams have their own logging solutions  and they often hire data analysts too  The main point is to measure what happens in your product  It takes some time to install and maintain these tools  but believe me  it worth it  Data will help you to have a clear picture  and make decisions  It can t replace the insights you get from user research  but it is still a must have  so it has its place on our UX checklist   We recently wrote an ebook   Product Managers  guide to UX design   Click here to download   5  Regular design meetings with business and dev leads  At UX studio we work in week long design sprints and we meet with our clients every week  In my experience it is important to have business guys and developers on these design meetings too  Business leaders can emphasis the goals  and developers can give feedback about the feasibility  If they take part in the design process they will also understand the solutions better  You can decide the frequency yourself  but you will need regular meetings with these guys  So it s better to schedule a recurring meeting  You should invite at least one developer and one business leader to the design meetings   6  Workshops to empathize with users and align the team  To make sure that everyone is on the same page  you should hold a persona  a jobs to be done or a customer journey workshop  On these workshops your team defines the personas you are building for together  and explore their journey with your product  At the end everybody will have a clear picture about the users and the context  It s not magic  but it will help your teammates to make good decisions about your product  And it definitely worth a few hours of time  UX people can help you to do some research so you can use real data  and they can also facilitate the workshops  We have many tricks to get people involved      Test your team quickly with this UX checklist  And now it s time to do a quick self check  How many questions can you answer with yes   Do you do at least one user test every week   Do you do some kind of product discovery regularly   Do you start building new features with prototypes   Do you have analytics tools installed   Do you have a recurring design meeting scheduled with biz and dev leaders   Have you done a design workshop together with your team   If you have 6 yes answers  you are awesome  You passed the UX Minimum test  Congratulations      If not  don t be sad  It s very easy to get started with these things  Just start doing   You can also like our Facebook page to get our latest UX tips and case studies,"[1388 75 1322 891 341 1259 145 188 355 543 1230]"
