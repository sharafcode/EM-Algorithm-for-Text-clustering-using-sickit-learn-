113,training-dataset/product/385.txt,product,My Daily Learning RitualTechmeme  Nuzzel  Curated Newsletters  Books  Products  Ever since I committed to being an infinite learner   I ve been executing on a daily one hour learning ritual  While it s easy to say that continuous learning is important to me  I knew that if I didn t proactively dedicate time in my day to it  it wouldn t become a habit  So I set aside an hour first thing in the morning with my morning cup of coffee  or two  to this ritual  Over time I ve refined what I actually do with that hour to maximize active learning of relevant skills and drive as much efficiency as possible in the process  I wanted to share my process in case it s helpful for formulating your own learning ritual I ultimately settled on a learning lifecycle of  I ll talk about each of these phases in turn and it s importance to my overall learning process The first thing I noticed in driving efficiency in my learning hour was separating the discovery of relevant content to consume from the actual consumption of that content  This was important for a few reasons  First  I was only going to spend an hour a day on this ritual  usually no more or no less  So there would always be more content than I could consume and needed to ensure I could efficiently catalog it independent of reading it  I also found that I was often discovering content outside of my hour ritual that I needed to catalog for consumption during the learning hour  And lastly  separating the discovery phase from the consumption phase helped me fine tune the process of discovery to understand how much time was wasted finding relevant and interesting content and what my signal to noise was in terms of finding great content I settled on using Pocket to store content I discovered  I installed the mobile app on my phone  which allowed me to easily save via the share action sheet any web page  blog  video  article  etc that I came across from any app I was in  I similarly installed the Pocket browser extension so I could quickly save content I discovered from my laptop  Instapaper is another great read it later service that provides similar functionality  Even though I was already using Evernote for capturing other kinds of content  I did find Pocket far more efficient for this task because of it s ability to really streamline the read it later workflow  including quickly archiving read articles  providing signals on what s popular  and simplifying the formatting of content for quicker reading The next important question became where do I discover the most relevant content for the topics I was interested in  The internet and social media in particular provide an endless supply of content  but it took me awhile to develop a strategy that in fact resulted in me efficiently discovering the most relevant content  For example  I no longer actually read my social media feeds directly on LinkedIn  Twitter  and Facebook as a source of content discovery because I found the signal to noise to be way too poor to be an efficient use of time  While there is certainly great content on these sites  directly sifting through it was low quality  the majority of shared pop culture   news was not relevant to my learning goals  and distracting  photos of what my friends were up to was distracting from the task at hand   I instead learned to rely on both algorithmic and human curators of the topics I cared about  Since I was eager to continue to build my expertise in product  design  startups  and technology  the following sources ended being most relevant for me  Techmeme provides the best algorithmic aggregator of the top headlines in the world of tech  With a dense but highly usable web interface  I could quickly scan headlines to stay abreast of what s going on in the tech world and drill in to the topics that were most interesting  The beauty of Techmeme is they actually rewrite the headlines of articles to give you the full gist of the article without having to dig in  Given my main goal with Techmeme was staying informed with the industry I worked on  I could accomplish this mostly by reading headlines and only occasionally saving actual articles to Pocket when it was particularly relevant to my areas of interest  Nuzzel became the way that I ultimately read my social media feeds  and in particular my Twitter feed  Nuzzel integrates with your Twitter and Facebook feeds and aggregates the mentions of various blog posts  articles  and videos that are shared amongst your feed  It effectively reads your feeds for you and bubbles up the most discussed content  This way I focus on following people on Twitter that are in the product  design  and startup communities that share relevant content and then relying on opening Nuzzel every morning to find the content that s buzzing amongst the folks I m following  It allows me to keep following people on Twitter that may provide relevant signals to quality content I care about without having to worry about the additional noise created by having to read their tweets since Nuzzel does that for me The third great source of content for me has been hand curated newsletters from various individuals and companies in the industry  I get them in my inbox and simply scan them for relevant content and add a subset to my Pocket  Here s a selection of my favorite newsletters I find that in the ever evolving world of product  design  and startups  the most relevant tactical content exists mostly in the form of online blogs  articles  and videos  However  I do use my learning hour as well to read books  For me I ve found books the best way to truly internalize the importance of a concept through a long read  For example  Fred Brooks  Mythical Man Month help me internalize how the cost of communication and alignment increases exponentially with team size  Brad Stone s Everything Store internalized the importance of a clear and sound strategy through the crystal clear strategy Jeff Bezos  executed at Amazon  And Ed Catmull s Creativity Inc  helped me develop my deep understanding of how you build a creative organization through an inside look at Pixar s very own process  I try to be very selective about the books I read given the large time commitment  so I require many recommendations for the same book from colleagues before I decide to commit to one In addition to blogs  articles  videos  and books  the best way to learn about product management is to carefully study products themselves  So I keep a running list of products to deep dive on  These might be competitor products that I come across  Or products that are buzzing in the industry  Or one s with new and novel design elements  Whenever someone mentions or I read about such a product  I add it to my to do list and spend time dissecting them as part of my learning hour  Looking for an in flow of products to analyze  Spend some time on Product Hunt and follow the collections of products most interesting and relevant to you  The forums are also a great way to hear commentary from others on the products as well I spend the bulk of my hour in the consumption phase  reading  watching  and analyzing the various content I ve stored in Pocket  When beginning the consumption phase  I don t simply read the newest or oldest content that s been saved to Pocket  Instead I scroll through Pocket and pick a topic I m going to read about and consume all the content associated with that topic  This reduces context switching between numerous topics and really allows me to deep dive on a given topic  One day it might be design related content  Another day it might be machine learning and AI  Or VR AR  Or mobile development  product development process  or product leadership  Or whatever else is most interesting or relevant to me at the time An important aspect to ensuring I actively engage with the content I consume and thus drive learning  retention  and ultimately application of these concepts are the share  discuss  and write phases In the share phase I decide what subset of content I ve read that resonates with me from the perspective of I agree with the advocated concepts  principles  tactics  etc  and am eager to implement them myself  This requires me to form a point of view on the content  which takes time to dissect it and not just quickly consume it  I share less than 25  of the content I consume based on this filter I use Buffer to schedule the content I share on LinkedIn  Twitter  and Facebook  Since I do all my reading in the morning  it s not ideal to share it all at that time  Buffer instead shares content 3 times a day for me  once in the morning  once mid day  and once in the evening  This way the content I read gains the most exposure across my various networks The part I do use social networks for in this process is engaging with my audiences on the content  So during my learning hour I ll review notifications on LinkedIn Twitter   and Facebook   including comments from various folks and engage them in conversation about the content  It s great to hear viewpoints from others  either agreeing or disagreeing  to help work through the ideas myself The content I find most compelling that I learned the most from I try to write about to solidify the ideas for myself  This might take the form of jotting down some notes about the topic for later reference  for example  For the most important learnings  it usually turns into adding the concept to my list of potential blog posts to write  I later revisit the list of hundreds of ideas and decide to convert a single or set of captured ideas into a full blog post I include blog post writing in my learning hour because I believe writing about various topics is one of the best ways to crystallize concepts in your head  since it requires you to really understand them to be able to commit them to writing  So up to once a week my learning hour is replaced with writing instead of reading to accomplish this I hope this gives you a detailed look at how my own learning ritual has evolved to maximize active learning of the most relevant topics each and every day,"[113 309 1304 924 209 1228 783 853 1356 1161 907]"
209,training-dataset/business/359.txt,business,How Effective Writing Can Increase Your Startup s SuccessHow Effective Writing Can Increase Your Startup s Success  Good writing is an important skill that is too often ignored in the process of launching a tech company  However  since so much startup marketing is web  and media based  accurately articulating what your company offers is more important than ever   If you think your company can benefit from a literary boost  and what company wouldn t    read on to acquire the basics you need to utilize writing to increase your company s chances of success  So dust off your quill and parchment and learn how you can harness the power of the written word   Why is Writing Important in the Startup World   Writers   Founders Are Not Exclusive from One Another  In the Forbes article   Why Being A Writer Made Me A Better Founder   Connu co founder and CEO Susannah Luthi compares writers to coders because of their myopic and obsessive tendencies  as well as the fact that both types of people have grand visions that must be reduced for feasibility    If you re a writer  you need to be able to feel some pressingly personal thing that s also big and sweeping  and then you ve got to talk about it in such a simple and intimate way that everyone will think you re a mind reader  If you lose your way  your words are worse than pointless  they re noise  Coders work from the same binary    Luthi states that the impetus for launching Connu with her co founder  the driving force that motivates all entrepreneurs to launch companies  comes from the same sense of urgency that drives writers to write  further concretizing the parallel between writers and entrepreneurs  Writers  like all innovators  see things as they are and as they might be    Creative arts belong at the heart of innovation and business    Terrible Writing Can Hurt Your Business  High quality writing is more vital to the success of your company than you think  Jessica Stillman illustrates the impact the written word has on a company s prospects in her Inc  article   3 Ways Terrible Writing Can Kill Your Business    According to Stillman  one linguistic crime that many companies commit is the propensity to aggrandize their own mission or purpose  Making grandiose statements about how your business will save the world will only make you come off as pompous and showy    Getting ahead of yourself when it comes to purpose  not only turns off commentators and potential employees  but also confuses customers  making it harder to understand and communicate what it is you actually do as a company    Also  exaggerating the size  impact  or market of a company can lead to trouble in the future  as it is often indicative of a lack of understanding of the company s offering on the part of the founders    If you really know what you re doing  you should be able to sell your vision simply in five or ten minutes without endless bloviating about  first mover advantage  and  breakthrough technologies     Creating Compelling Content  Now that you know how inextricable writing and business are  let s explore how you can utilize the written word to increase your company s chances for success   Pratik Dholakiya  the co founder of E2M   MoveoApps  wrote an Entrepreneur article dedicated to the subject of crafting engaging content for a business  The article  titled  Think Like a Journalist to Create Compelling Content That Gets Noticed   outlines several key points to consider when writing to attract customers  emphasizing the need to adopt a journalistic mindset over typical SEO copywriting   Brand Content Isn t Always Reliable  Before creating content for your company  take into account the fact that most people are naturally suspicious of a brand s content as they feel that they are only being coerced into buying something  If you want to attract the attention of your potential customers  look at your company s offering from the point of view of your clientele    Think in terms of a newsroom  and apply the principles of journalism  Be true  use facts and figures  give clear industry insights with some cross references and complete your content with a compelling beginning  middle  and conclusion    Valuable Content Establishes Trust With Your Customers  The best way to gain the trust of your customers is to prioritize the value you are offering them  In the realm of content marketing  providing something of value to your target audience is paramount and should take precedence over telling them to invest their money in your product    The sole focus of your content should be to provide valuable insights to your customers so that they can make better purchase decisions    How to Compose a Powerful Press Release  While digital marketers often scoff at the idea of employing press releases as part of their marketing strategies  there is no denying that press releases are still one of the most powerful means of informing your audience   if executed correctly   In fact  according to John Pilmer in his Entrepreneur article  The Venerable Press Release Remains the Cornerstone of Public Relations   press releases  despite a history dating back to the early 1900s  are even more important in the digital age as they possess a professional quality that transcends cyber noise    While social media  Google AdWords  brand based websites  email blasts  banner ads  blogs and a plethora of other new age technologies are an important part of any marketing strategy   especially for startups   these things will not replace the more formal and far reaching concept of a professional press release    However  composing a powerful press release that will get you and your company noticed is no small feat  and too many forget the fact that badly written press releases end up in the digital dustbin  Furthermore  according to Erik Sherman in his Inc  article   7 Simple Changes to Make Your Press Release Soar   99 percent of the press releases he receives on a weekly basis are immediately tossed  If you want your press release to stick  follow the steps Sherman recommends below   In the media industry  the lede is the introduction to a story  A strong lede will give your audience a reason to continue reading  so be sure to include your lede at the beginning of a press release  If it s  buried  under several paragraphs of unimportant content  you ve got problems   Keeping your press releases short not only ensures that your lede is easy to find  it also allows journalists to develop their story quicker  Remember to only include the most important  relevant  and newsworthy items in your press release  and avoid unnecessary words    You or your PR representatives should be able to write a serviceable release in 250 words or less  In fact  you should be able to pitch the kernel of the idea in a single paragraph  If you  or they  can t  then go back to the drawing board and throw out everything that is unimportant    Have a point other than yourself  Entrepreneurs love to talk about themselves and their companies  Unfortunately for them  journalists don t care  They only care about interesting stories  so research the kinds of topics that journalists write about and look up examples of press releases online   Including exclamation points  or any other flourishes you think are clever  will not entice your audience  Keep in mind that press releases should report facts  figures  major news  etc   so let the journalists determine how exciting the content of your press release really is    I don t care how enthusiastic you feel or how young  energetic  and recently out of college the person who wrote it is  It makes you look like a rank amateur because it conveys no excitement at all    Too many startups submit press releases indiscriminately  without regard to who they are sending it to  If you don t have a story that will pique the interest of the party you re submitting to  don t submit anything  Before you begin distributing your press release to reporters and journalists  compile a list of those who actually write about similar stories  your respective market  etc   Kill meaningless and stupid buzzwords  When it comes to describing what your company does  take some advice from the great Albert Einstein   If you can t explain it simply  you don t understand it well enough   Regardless of how complex your company is  or how complex you think it is  remember that it s always possible to simplify your company s description  Explaining concepts in plain English will only serve to attract more customers    One of the best lessons in communications I ever had came during an organic chemistry class  The professor explained that buzzwords are terms invented to keep insiders in and outsiders out  If you keep out all but the insiders  there won t be anyone to talk to  Not good for a growing company    When it comes to reporting on your company s recent success or achievement  you can take confidence only so far before coming off as arrogant to your audience  Too many companies profess to disrupting or revolutionizing a market they ve only just ventured into  Imbue some modesty into your press release to spare yourself some embarrassment   How to Write an Effective Blog Post  While disseminating a press release that details your company s recent success can be an effective strategy for attracting attention  it can be a costly and tedious process  However  for those who lack the funds and time to prepare and distribute a press release  writing periodic blog posts on your company and related topics is a viable approach to keeping your audiences updated   In the Entrepreneur article   How to Write a Blog Post in Just 30 Minutes   Mel Carson elaborates on the practicality of a blog in lieu of a traditional press release    While press release distribution companies like PR Newswire and PRWeb definitely have their place in the digital marketing ecosystem  using a blog to tell a story that you can control can be an effective way to have your news and views shared inexpensively and generate coverage in third party publications    Since content marketing is so prevalent in the startup world  it s more important than ever to know how to craft an engaging blog post  Not convinced  Just ask Neil Patel who  in his Entrepreneur article  8 Must Have Ingredients of a Successful Blog Post   expounds on the components you need to keep your audience interested in your company   1  The article needs a point  The benefits of creating a blog post with a point are twofold   An article with a point gives your audience something they will feel more compelled to read  share  and comment on   An article with a point allows you to implement the targeted keywords you researched when planning the marketing strategy for your company   2  Images  Yes  incorporating images in your blog post may not help it attract search engines and crawlers  but it will help boost the quality of your blog post and give your audience more context  something more to illustrate your point  Simply put   show  don t just tell   3  Structure  Your blog post needs to be organized to ensure that you do don t lose your audience  This may seem like a no brainer  but a scattered collection of sentences and ideas will not keep your audience engaged   Neil Patel recommends following the structure outlined below   Introduction  Set the stage for your discussion   Make your point  Explain it   Make your next point  Explain it   Do this for as many points as you have   Conclusion  Wrap up the article with a call to action   4  Unique content  To stick out from the plethora of blogs that already exist in your industry  you must create unique content or take a unique angle on a common topic   While curated content lists  such as  best of the web  posts are fine  but because they lack original content  they should be done infrequently    Unique content is more likely to be linked and shared  People are going to go to your content because it s one of a kind    5  Substantial length  While an article should be long enough to convey an idea or explain a topic  considerable data shows that longer posts tend perform better than shorter ones  so don t be afraid to go in depth when writing a blog post    My research  experience  and data all point to long form content performing better in social sharing  search indexing  organic traffic  and conversions  If you re regularly creating content that is in the 1 000  to 1 500 word range  you re doing well  If most of your articles are about 200 to 300 words then you could probably beef up a bit    6  Internal linking  Linking to other related posts on your site is an effective way to enhance the quality and boost the authority of your blog posts   Neil Patel outlines several easy strategies for you to link to other sources in your article   Create enough content throughout the site   Use links that the reader will be interested in   Link to relevant data on your site   Use enough internal links to make it worthwhile  ideally 3 10 per post   7  Attention to proper spelling and grammar  Proper spelling and grammar on your site is important to maintain a professional and authoritative tone in your blog post  so remember to give your blog post several editorial passes before posting   8  A call to action  Every post on your company s blog should have a call to action  as it is the key to attracting more conversions  Be sure to craft compelling and eye catching copy when creating your call to action because this is where your reader s attention has been drawn to    Every post needs a call to action  The reader is ready to respond  to do  to click  to engage  What do you want them to do  Whether it s capturing an email address  visiting another page  purchasing a product  or downloading an ebook  you need to have an explicit call to action for each article  every time    Conclusion  Remember  you don t need to be Shakespeare or Austen to create a powerful written message for your audience  However  regardless of your profession or industry  it is vital to cultivate a sensitivity to the effect words can have on your readership  In a digital age convoluted with text speak and shortcuts  crafting a meaningful message is more essential for a company s prospects than ever  so always write truthfully and write with conviction    You don t write because you want to say something  you write because you have something to say     F  Scott Fitzgerald,"[209 1304 853 783 309 750 113 924 1228 539 62]"
229,training-dataset/product/603.txt,product,The ultimate guide to web content accessibilityWebsites with standards compliant code all follow the typical W3C standards  But there s a whole different level of compliance when it comes to WCAG  also known as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines   The same people who produce the HTML5 CSS3 specs organize and officiate these guidelines  so it s truly an international system of coding standards  Most web developers never bother with WCAG accessibility  but it s becoming a huge aspect of the internet   This post was originally published on Vandelay Design   If you re looking to understand accessibility or just want to delve a bit deeper into the subject  then this guide is for you  I ll explain some basics of WCAG conformance for a beginner  along with all the tools and resources you ll need to keep learning along the way   Intro to WCAG  The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines follow the current v2 0 spec requirements for accessible websites  This page explains the absolute fundamental concepts without getting into too much technical detail  The W3C WAI website is the absolute best resource for information on this subject   I d also like to clarify that there are levels of compatibility when it comes to content accessibility  You don t need to be a AAA perfect site to be considered accessible  Follow some basic tenets set in the WCAG  and you ll significantly improve the experience for millions of people   Here s a rundown of some crucial guidelines to follow for modern web accessibility   Text alternatives and captions for non text media  videos and images   Allow users to traverse the page with only the keyboard  Give users control over which features to load or change  Design page text with sufficient contrast  Other common accessibility points include allowing visitors increase text size and giving visitors the option to disable JS CSS without destroying usability  This can move into the territory of progressive enhancement  which goes hand in hand with accessibility   WCAG conformance  As you can tell from the best practices page  there s a lot that goes into web accessibility  The topic continues to grow  and it can take years to master all of this stuff   If you want to dive in  check out this guide published by the WCAG 2 0 team  It covers all the specific areas you d need to learn about for all levels of conformance   But thankfully you don t need to master all of this stuff  because even basic accessibility practices can go a long way to improving the overall usability on any website   The goal here isn t to pass a WCAG test  although that s definitely good  But rather your goal should be to give all users the best experience possible regardless of limitations or disabilities   WCAG ratings are called conformance levels and they define a website s overall success in relation to accessibility parameters  The WCAG 2 0 spec has a conformance page explaining the 5 necessary requirements of an accessible website   A grading level of conformance must be met with either A  AA  or AAA The full webpage must conform to standards  not just a part of the page Related process pages must all conform to the same rating or higher to be considered accessible for example  an eCommerce checkout process  Accessibility must be achieved by use of supported technologies deemed credible by the WCAG It s possible to use technologies that are not fully accessible  so long as the content is still accessible with a different technology  for example  a Flash video with a supplementary text transcript   The WCAG defines these 5 requirements as vital to the success of a webpage  It s still possible to pass a conformance test with a single A rating in fact that d be better than most sites   But some sites have limitations where they must hit a minimum of AA or AAA  This is mostly in the realm of public companies like government agencies  so private companies don t need to worry as much   The conformance scale works like this  You score a single A rating when you hit all priority 1 checkpoints  Priority 1 and 2 earns the AA rating  while AAA is reserved for sites that conform to priority 1 3 requirements  Take a look at the full WCAG checklist to learn more   It s incredibly lengthy  and this topic could easily be published into a tome of information  I d like to just cover a handful of vital steps in the process to get you started on the right path towards web accessibility   Navigation and consumption  All content on the page should be easy to read and consume  This obviously means proper grammar and correct spelling  but also content location and text size   Accessible text follows some general rules specified in the WCAG 2 0 quick reference guide   Text is never aligned justified  Text should be able to dynamically resize without requiring the user to scroll horizontally  Line spacing between lines of text should be at least a space and a half depending on text size  Spaces between paragraphs should be at least 1 5x larger than line height  These guidelines are made by the WAI WCAG and should be followed strictly to adhere with global standards  Since the standards can be applied in scale  it s easy to follow these rules for any type of text  from headers to paragraphs and tiny captions   There s also a strict method of selecting contrast ratios  which is covered in depth in the next section   Let s not forget about navigation design and usability  Not all users have mice  or they may not be able to use a mouse  so the keyboard is the next best option   Even though it s a tough spec to meet  the WCAG recommends that compliant websites support keyboard accessibility for all common website features  This includes navigation menus  page hyperlinks  and input fields for web forms   Naturally this technique could rely heavily on JavaScript  and many people have written about keyboard accessibility for alternate tips   It s often best to start with a list of features and plan each one in advance  This way you ll have more confidence when designing a new site and placing accessibility at the forefront   Perhaps the best line of success is to provide keyboard shortcuts for all major functionality  This can include a clear navigation menu but also links for jumping to main content   Take a peek at the official guides provided by the Web Accessibility Initiative  WAI   They control the WCAG guidelines and want to provide as much help as possible   Text contrast ratios  Design text contrast for your layouts while checking against WCAG metrics for visual content  This requires free tools like a contrast checker to figure out your color and background ratio   But it s a very simple procedure that can greatly increase your website s accessibility with just a few changes   The WCAG checks colors based on a luminosity ratio of 3 1 for larger text  and 4 5 1 for smaller text  This ratio measures the luminosity of background and foreground colors using some complicated math to attain a ratio value   This ratio defines contrast for accessibility and gives web designers a number to shoot for  You probably don t need to worry much about the numbers  but rather should just try colors and see which combinations work best   Once you have some colors you ll want to use contrast tools for checking your work  The open source contrast ratio checker on GitHub is a popular choice   But there s also many free web apps like ContrastChecker com and Check My Colours  The benefit of these sites lies in the details   For example  Check My Colours will check an entire live webpage  The GitHub ratio checker only works on two colors that you manually input into the page  Both are very useful but for different reasons at different stages of the creative process   If you don t want to use web apps  try browser add ons instead  My recommendations are the WCAG contrast checker for Firefox and the Color Contrast Analyzer for Chrome   Content organization  It s easy to get lost in CSS floats and custom hacks  and forget the value of semantic HTML  Accessibility guidelines dictate that content should follow a logical focus order where headers  paragraphs  and sub headers should be organized based on content direction   Not all users will have the full CSS experience  Just because content floats a certain way doesn t mean it ll be consumed that way by everyone   Consider following the progressive enhancement model where you disable CSS and JS completely while first building a layout  Examine how the site looks as just raw HTML  Can you follow the content in a logical manner  If so  then your content is built perfectly   If you want to improve content recognition  the WCAG also recommends location markers like breadcrumbs  These keep visitors in tune with their current location and other parent pages on the website   This can also be clarified by providing multi page headers and a clear site map  All of these techniques are great for hitting that AAA score   Do everything you can to organize text in a clear fashion  regardless of technologies available to the visitor   Learning resources  If you re looking to follow WCAG rulesets  you ll want to pay attention to requirements with testing tools  There are dozens of third party tools online  and they all help with different aspects of the testing process   But I d like to give an honorable mention to this tools list hosted by the W3C WAI website  It s full of great resources  and while it s very long  it s the best place to start searching for a tool that ll fulfill your exact needs   It s tough to use tools if you don t know exactly what you need  So perhaps the best place to start is a free online cheatsheet  I really like Viget s interactive sheet with dynamic elements for A  AA  and AAA ratings   Here s a technical cheatsheet offering code snippets and technical explanations  Follow whatever method is going to help you find exactly what features you want to support and how much you want to conform to WCAG 2 0   Once you ve fixed up your site  test it  For live testing tools  try WAVE or Achecker they re both completely free   I prefer WAVE because it s simpler but offers many more features  You get warnings and alerts based on content issues with the site  and you can even check other sites to see how they compare to your own   I highly recommend browsing this site for accessibility resources and live examples  You ll find tables  galleries  and other common page elements built with accessibility in mind   By studying how they should work on a real site  you ll learn how to implement elements in your own projects  Getting started is never easy  but it helps to have quality examples at your disposal to study and replicate as needed   I also like this post by Terrill Thompson it covers accessible websites in more detail  Terrill provides live examples  including many US government websites that are required to follow 508 accessibility guidelines   Understanding WCAG and learning to build compliant websites will take years of practice  Developers who take this seriously understand how important it is  But that doesn t mean you need to make websites that are fully WCAG compliant   Even a basic understanding of contrast and font size adjustments are enough to make your sites consumable by a wider audience,"[229 1304 853 1228 113 539 924 209 1047 783 636]"

539,training-dataset/business/20.txt,business,The SEO Tips That Helped Tally 20 Million Visits A MonthThree quarters after Yummly launched  its Chief Growth Officer Ethan Smith watched the food discovery platform log its 10 millionth visit in a month  However  like most enduring recipes  it didn t become a crowd favorite by tossing together ingredients in a fit of inspiration  Yummly s SEO strategy  which helped the startup top the charts as the best global recipe app for iPhone  iPad and Android  was years in the making  going back to Smith s first company   Smith started his career as a user experience designer and researcher  At Wize  he managed product  design and marketing  until Nextag acquired the product review startup  Since 2010  he s held various roles at Yummly  including its Head of Product and VP of Growth  helping it tally over 20 million monthly visits  Beyond Yummly  he actively advises startups such as Wanelo  Vinted and Thumbtack on strategies to improve growth and SEO   In this exclusive interview  Smith shares why a specific inflection point with SEO has led to costly misconceptions and missteps  He outlines how to recognize and sidestep them as well as identifies key tenets for high performance SEO  For any company that has lost confidence in or hit the wall with SEO  Smith s tactics can help retrofit and reenergize your strategy   A PARADIGM SHIFT WITH SEO  One reason the concept of product market fit resonates is because the balance and reliance between the two elements   product and market   is front and center in its name  But when many startups think about SEO  minds often jump to sly maneuvers and hacking a way to growth  The truth is that optimization is only as strong as one s understanding of the search engine part of the equation  When the rules of search change  so must the strategy  Over the last five years  Smith has seen startups neglect a shift that has changed a big part of SEO    A new era for SEO began in early 2011  when Google launched Panda  its change to its search results ranking algorithm  What was once a very simple algorithm was revamped to penalize low quality  thin sites  Gone were the days of a formula based mainly on keyword density and pagerank   says Smith   In the SEO of the past  one could repeat and conceal a bunch of keywords in a tiny font with camouflaged text to increase word density and pagerank  A SEO manager s job was to find holes like this and exploit them until Google would slap your wrists and patch the gaps  Because the penalties were short lived  people would go back to finding and exploiting another loophole as soon as they could    Together with Google Penguin  which penalizes artificial boosts in page rankings through backlinks  Panda brought in somewhat of a new world order with SEO   While most of the workings of the Penguin filter is public  there was   and still is   more unknowns with Panda  For example  if your site is penalized by Panda  it could take years to get released from it and it s not obvious how that happens   says Smith   Here s what I ve seen occur over and over  Founder starts a company  He s not an SEO expert  but hears that it s important  He asks around  and is told to launch 50 million pages  The startup starts with 100 000 and sees traffic go up  Then it launches 1 million more pages  More traffic comes  Then it launches 50 million pages  Traffic soars  Then a few months later  traffic tanks  The founder frantically tries to get the traffic back  Months go by  but nothing works    Aggressive SEO  red  versus gradual SEO  green   THE ERA OF GOOD CONTENT AND ENGAGEMENT  It s not earth shattering to learn that Google tweaks its algorithm to reward good content and user experience  but the hard part is figuring out how to act to actually reap those benefits   What s required is not only a change in behavior  but a switch of mentality  Nearly every get traffic quick scheme pulls the carpet out from under you eventually   says Smith   You have to think for the long haul  the growth curve you want is more gradual and steady  It won t look good in the early days  but it will lead to significantly more long term traffic if you re consistent    Here s where to start to embark on the steady curve   Use Google s guide   not your guesswork   to define what s good   If improving your content quality and traffic is your goal  there are levers to pull  but don t assume you can choose which ones   Most people instinctively nominate themselves as authorities of what s good when it comes to content and user experience  With SEO  that s not what actually matters   says Smith   What s important is what Google has defined as good content and good engagement  Note that I didn t say what is objectively good  but what is subjectively defined as good by Google  Google has a set of guidelines   about 150 pages of them   and has hired thousands of quality raters to rate pages and sites based on their guidelines    The closer your page resembles those labeled as good content by Google s rubric  the better your  content quality  is and the more your page will rise in the rankings   It s like any sport or board game  Some rules may not make sense  but you have to abide by them to win over time   says Smith   For example  scraping and summarizing content can be arguably a very useful thing for users  but Google has decided it s not  For Yummly  recipes that have a lot of reviews or that have a  cook mode  are ranked highly because Google decided that these make a recipe high quality    When it comes to Google s guide to content quality  it s big theme is EAT  which stands for expertise  authority and trustworthiness   The guide goes into detail about what standard of expertise is expected for various topics  For example  medical advice should come from people or organizations with the proper accreditation  but forums for spouses of those who died from an ailment are also considered experts  The differentiating factor is what life experience is necessary to credibly give others value  The guide offers a good guiding question   What kind of expertise is required for the page to achieve its purpose well     Smith works with companies to help establish high EAT scores for their particular category   In order to get a high EAT score in shopping  Wanelo shows reviews and photos for each product as well as return policy and shipping information  To show that Wanelo is a highly reputable company  it highlights press coverage in the New York Times  Fortune and other credible media publications on its press page   he says   For local services  Thumbtack highlights how many years a practitioner has been in business  whether they are licensed  how many jobs they have completed and  most importantly  lots of 5 star reviews    With SEO  you can be righteous or right  To be the latter  follow Google s guidelines  not your gut   Beyond the few hundred pages of SEO guidelines from Google  Smith highlights a few underappreciated tips to consider as you tweak your search engine optimization strategy   Ethan Smith  Keep good hygiene   One of the underappreciated aspects of SEO has less to do with what you do and more with what you don t  It s not the type of sexy growth hacking that gets written about  but it s as critical   Too many people continue with growth strategies that worked before Panda  but which now penalize them  Don t spend energy trying to get out of Panda s penalties  direct your energy toward good hygiene and maintenance  This strategy involves striking a balance between testing new SEO strategies and tracking your pages to detect issues early to prevent future penalties    Here are a few tips from Smith on keeping good SEO hygiene   Schedule a weekly open ended crawl of your site  A lot of times  companies  sites will have pages cluttering Google s index that they don t want indexed and don t know about   What most people don t understand is that Google will index whichever page they want  It s not about what you put in your sitemap  It s about any page Google can find it will index unless you tell them not to   says Smith   Establish an open ended crawl of your site weekly to look for pages that shouldn t be there  Detecting those is supremely important to improving SEO   and part of good hygiene  Use tools such as Screaming Frog to crawl your site and QA    Track your number of pages  how many are getting crawled  how many are indexed and how many are getting traffic   Take note of any big differences in those figures  So  the alarm should sound if you have 1 000 pages  but only 200 are getting crawled  Or 1 000 pages crawled  but only 200 are getting indexed  Or 1 000 are indexed  but only 10 are getting traffic   says Smith   You want all your pages to be crawled on a weekly basis and 95  indexation rate with the majority getting traffic    Sample Hygiene Report  Eliminate incidental indexed pages  It bears repeating  it doesn t matter if you think your pages are important  what s key is what Google deems important  Google will tell you whether your page is important by crawling it often  indexing it and sending it traffic  Google doesn t like sites with lots of thin pages  Once a crawl catches these  thin  pages  get rid of them  Don t be surprised if you find  thin  pages indexed unintentionally or unknowingly    Depending on their site architecture  startups can accidentally create and index tons of pages without knowing its impact on SEO   says Smith   For example  Yummly users have profile pages for each of its 18 million users  These millions of pages are core to the Yummly feature set and thus are very useful  However  very few people search Google looking for profile pages   they search for a chicken casserole recipe  The issue is that Google will classify these profile pages as too thin and penalize us  We avoid this by being careful about which pages we allow to be indexed    Once you ve found  thin  pages  there are a few ways forward   The best and fastest way to eliminate them is to remove an entire directory by disallowing it in the robots txt file or using the directory removal tool in Google Webmaster Tools  You can also remove individual pages either with a noindex tag or by returning a 404 410 error code   says Smith   But stay vigilant  as there are other ways  thin  pages crop up  Many sites have HTTPS and HTTP versions of every page  that means that every single page gets indexed twice  Pages can be indexed with and without a  www   At Yummly  we noticed our DEV servers   like DEV1 yummly com  DEV2 yummly com and so on   created duplicate versions of our site  If we didn t catch it  we d accidentally have 10 versions of our site getting indexed and causing duplicate content issues    Flatten your internal link architecture  Pagerank sculpting is dead  What matters now is a sufficiency of links and pagerank  The more you can flatten your internal architecture  the more each of your pages attain sufficient pagerank  and the more your traffic will increase   Most internal links are skewed toward just a few pages  You might have internal links that are the most recent posts  If you have a thousand pages  the most recent posts are likely ten pages  Then you re not linking to the other 990  which signals to Google that these pages are not important and so they don t get traffic   says Smith   Instead  link across all your pages so that Google has many paths to find all of the pages on your site  not just a small percentage of them  So  if you re showcasing an easy to use digital camera  don t just link to other cameras  Link to other easy to use categories  like headphones or TVs  Cross linking vertically and horizontally creates a more tightly connected  flat link architecture    Steal first  Then innovate   The growth strategy that took Smith three years to find and fine tune at Wize started to work at Yummly after only three months  Given that long term growth in SEO takes time  startups can t afford a steep learning curve when just getting started   Worry about innovation when it comes to your core product  not your SEO  It s not well publicized but most successful growth teams and companies take the most effective strategies from competitors  apply them in house  then improve upon them   says Smith   SEO is no exception  Most of what works is not obvious at the onset  so startups spend an enormous amount of time reinventing the wheel    Smith has found success with research   not just secondary  but primary   We look for the most successful SEO companies  We deeply analyze their site and strategy to understand what s working  Then we try to connect with the person in charge of their SEO to ask them directly what s working and what s not   he says   Don t just research and reach out to who you subjectively think might be interesting  We use Sistrix and SimilarWeb to evaluate competitor traffic and engagement  For Yummly  we care about certain growth indicators   such as overall traffic  high SERP rank  and a steady growth trajectory   to identify which sites have the most effective SEO strategy  Then we find people who work at those companies  reach out and ask if they d be open to a call  I never have open ended chats over coffee  I do my homework and bring a list of pointed questions about specific parts of their site    Ninety percent of the people that Smith reached out to share techniques with him   They might not say everything but they ll answer if I have specific questions  Taken together with other conversations  this helps keep our strategy current  Of course  I offer them ideas on what has worked for us  too  so that the exchange is mutually beneficial   he says   It sounds simple  but many just research from afar  We like to both reach out to other growth experts as well as test common attributes across sites   like Yelp  Zillow and Houzz   that correlate with traffic  In fact  don t just look at competitors  but those outside your category  We ve actually learned a lot from TripAdvisor s page structure    At Yummly  Smith used both types of research   along with his personal experience   to successfully revamp its category pages   We launched category pages at my last company where we would find keywords and create pages that target those keywords  So we did the same at Yummly  basing them on structured taxonomies like shopping categories and filters  So there d be a page for digital cameras and a page for every filter  such as digital camera between  50 and  100   he says   It worked  but not well  By talking with peers and pattern matching with other sites  we realized that our structured taxonomies were not using the words that people use to search in Google form  We then found the phrases that people are actually searching for on Google  such as  digital cameras for wildlife photography   and curated category pages for those terms  That worked much better because the page exactly matched an actual query that people type into a search box    Approach SEO as acquisition   According to Smith  most big companies became very successful by being extremely aggressive with their growth   Airbnb used Craigslist early on to tap into a broader market  Pinterests emails all your Facebook friends telling them you followed them when you didn t  Linkedin makes it easy to accidentally send invitations to your entire contact list  The most successful companies are also extremely aggressive   with email marketing  paid advertising and referrals   but not SEO   says Smith   In the past  SEO success favored the most aggressive companies  After Google Panda or Penguin  success favors companies those that take a steady long term approach to growth  Be aggressive with SEO in the sense that you want to deploy resources to work on it in the first place  but don t do too much too fast that s not in your actual strategy    In the age of mobile  most will claim that websites aren t important anymore or that SEO is dead   The truth is that  when used as an acquisition vehicle  SEO is more effective now than it ever has been  In fact  other than gaming apps  the most successful apps  like Pinterest  Yelp  and Houzz  use web SEO as their main app acquisition channel   says Smith   Most SEO visitors come to a site  look at a couple pages  then leave  It s easy to dismiss these passerby users as not valuable  The goal is to get SEO visitors to come back  Whether it s by getting someone to register  use an engaging feature or download the app  When viewed as an acquisition channel  SEO can be one of the most impactful channels to drive long term lifetime value    With SEO  you can never be 100  confident  But once you know that  you re more likely to be good at it   THE SEO TEAM YOU  THINK YOU  NEED  The first mistake you might make   especially as a startup   is thinking that you need a team or person dedicated to SEO from the get go   Your SEO strategy and roadmap might come from someone you have in house  but it s as likely that it will   and probably should   come from a consultant or advisor   says Smith   At Wize  we turned the corner when our consultant  Leo Haryono  gave me his initial recipe  which I took and built from  I know I could have eventually come to the same result  but calling him in helped us shortcut that learning process    An SEO hire or consultant should join in once you ve validated some traction and traffic   For most consumer companies  that ll be around 100 000 visits per month  The role of the SEO manager will not only be to double down on what s started to work  but to build really good content  make engagement better and build PR marketing backlinks through the methods I ve mentioned   says Smith   At this point  the SEO person needs to become a stakeholder in product decisions and should advise on the parameters that the content creators or Product should consider in their work  Make sure this person can point to an SEO engine they ve built at another company and explain how exactly she grew traffic with tools that don t cost a fortune  A lot can be done with Google or Bing Webmaster tools as well as free or low tier versions of Majestic SEO or Sistrix  If she can t clearly communicate those two elements  take pause and move onto other referrals    It s at this point that a startup should double down with SEO  but through smartly building out its existing teams and product   You ve got a team and a dedicated SEO person or consultant  Now it s about syncing and scaling the teams in an intentional way  If reviews are a lever for growth for your business  build in hooks into your core product to encourage users to write them  Airbnb has done a great job here in creating hooks that feed SEO into the core product   says Smith   Nerdwallet is another great example  By scaling into an army of really great finance writers  they have been able to have great SEO  Its focus was not around weird tricks and hidden text  but about writing high quality articles on topics that people sought out    Bringing it All Together  There has been a sea change with SEO  With the introduction of Google Panda and Penguin  the game has changed over the last five years  The problem is that the methods of many people tackling SEO have not changed along with it  Through good hygiene and understanding of Google s guidelines  startups can avoid falling into traps that could penalize their traffic and pagerank for years to come  Schedule a weekly crawl of your site to identify and eliminate  thin  pages on your site  Take proactive measures to flatten your link architecture  Start SEO from Day 1  but don t be too aggressive too fast   either with your strategy or your investment in an SEO hire  The name of the game is slow and steady wins the race  Instead invest in good content and frame SEO as an acquisition tool  Have faith in in in the long term  quick fixes lead to quick declines    With SEO  even if you find a way to identify every variable  you won t be able to control each one  You might change a title tag but there are a thousand other factors that you re not controlling for that influence results  The challenges with causation and correlation abound   says Smith   If there s one thing I hope startups take away about SEO is that it s a marathon  not a sprint  Quick twitch muscles won t do any good here   in fact  they ll likely get you into trouble  Endurance and awareness are the attributes that get rewarded with SEO  I wish people would swap growth hacking for growth harvesting  That s the type of approach that truly works

636,training-dataset/product/1268.txt,product,Beyond touch  designing effective gestural interactionsThe future of interaction is multimodal  But combining touch with air gestures  and potentially voice input  isn t a typical UI design task   At Exipple  our design and engineering teams work together to create user interfaces for various contexts that respond to hand gestures and adapt to users  movements and physical properties  Drawing from an iterative design  development  and evaluation process  I d like to share our insights on what works in gestural interaction   Design for gesture discovery  Gestures are often perceived as a natural way of interacting with screens and objects  whether we re talking about pinching a mobile screen to zoom in on a map  or waving your hand in front of your TV to switch to the next movie  But how natural are those gestures  really   For users who ve never experienced a particular interaction paradigm before  gestures are unfamiliar territory  While we all intuitively know what to do in order to see more detail on a map displayed on a touchscreen  consider looking at it from some distance on a large display  What if somebody just told you that you can move your hands in some natural and intuitive way to zoom into that map without touching the screen  What would be the first gesture you d try  When confronted with such a question  each one of us could define our own natural gestures   Design for discovery is crucial  Make sure you provide the right cues design signifiers that help users discover easily how they can interact with gestures  These can be visual tips about which gesture triggers a particular action  After repeated use  these discovery tips will no longer be necessary because users will have learned the gestures   It s possible to design animations that develop progressively to reveal an opportunity to interact in a different way  For example  in order to make users aware that they can interact from a distance  without actually touching the screen  we created a menu that reveals more information as the hand points towards the screen  Initially there s a playful arrangement of floating images  A   Getting closer and raising the hand towards those reveals that each image is actually a category that contains content  B    Why direct translation from touch doesn t work  Last year we did a small  informal study  We invited people to our studio and showed them some familiar interfaces on a TV display  menus with icons  a map  a grid  and a carousel view  We asked them to imagine how they d interact with these interfaces from a distance using air gestures   The interfaces were actually a set of mini gestural prototypes  After we collected their expectations  they explored those and gave us feedback  What emerged as a clear pattern was that their expectations were largely driven by their familiarity with touch gestures on mobile devices  All of our participants applied the mental models they have from using their mobile phones to air gestures  Sometimes one could even guess the difference between iOS and Android users from their expectations on how the interface would work   But we quickly encountered a challenge  What s most intuitive is not necessarily the most efficient and easy to use  For example  a mouse is a high precision device that affords a good level of control  A human hand moving in the air across 3 dimensions is not as precise  We might think we re moving our hand across an X axis  while we re actually also moving it slightly across the other dimensions   We can t expect to achieve the same level of precision  Focusing on making very careful movements will inevitably create some tension and  stiff hands  are by no means a natural interaction   When touching a screen surface  the point of touch becomes a start a point of reference  Now consider the difference between the typical 2 finger pinch gesture to zoom in and out and using your fingers or both hands in the air to form a similar kind of pinch or spread gesture  The point of reference for the zoom level becomes unclear  And you can t just let go off the touchscreen to stop the interaction  so the start and end point also become ambiguous   Try not to translate touch gestures directly to air gestures even though they might feel familiar and easy  Gestural interaction requires a fresh approach one that might start as unfamiliar  but in the long run will enable users to feel more in control and will take UX design further   Kill that  jumpy  cursor  If you re using computer vision technology for your project  like capturing gestures with depth sensor cameras such as Kinect  Asus  Orbecc  etc    you know that hands or fingers aren t always tracked 100  on their exact position as they move   Other technologies might afford better precision  but they usually require users to wear special devices  The computer can t always  see  our hand position as it moves  and the result is what we call the trembling hand  the view of a somewhat  nervous  and unstable cursor or pointer on the screen   Designing a different pointer or cursor won t help much  as it still needs to follow a hand moving on the screen  You could ask developers to filter out the very subtle hand movements to avoid this effect  This solution  however  comes at the high price of losing some responsiveness and precision  with a slightly slower cursor lagging behind the hand  which gives users less of a sense of control over the interface  And losing on user control is something we can t afford   So  what should we do   Kill that cursor  Don t have cursors on touchscreens  either  Eliminate the need for a cursor as feedback  but provide an alternative  Make images and objects  pop out  and respond to the user s hand movement instantly  without any pointers   This fundamentally changes the way you think about the user interface  It s not web  and it s not a mobile touch experience  either   Think freely  Try to liberate your creative thinking from the standard web and mobile UI patterns you re familiar with  Forget about buttons think actions  Imagine that you no longer have screens  but instead you want to use gestures to control devices in the environment around you  How would you tell the TV to lower the volume  How would you turn the light on   Symbolic and iconic gestures  such as making the  Shhh  sign with your index finger to tell your TV to lower the volume  are instant and expressive  They might be context specific and require some user onboarding  but once users learn them  they re easy to remember and perform   Some successful gestures we ve developed to control media playback   Aim to create associations between the gesture and the action that it triggers  These can be based on meaning or a visual reference that s easy to memorize  It s not easy you need to consider aspects like cultural context  For example  gestural expressions that are perfectly acceptable in one country or culture might mean something rude in another  Symbols that are very prominent in some contexts might not be helpful in others   Relying on symbolic gestures to create all of sorts interactions would probably result in far too many gestures to remember  Consider those as your quick  powerful shortcuts something worth assigning to actions that your user does repeatedly and frequently   Minimize false positives  One of the biggest challenges for a computer is to distinguish between real intent and all those accidental hand gestures that people do naturally  like moving your hands around while talking to someone   It s easy to trigger actions accidentally and experience an erratic user interface that changes when it shouldn t  As a UI designer  you need to work closely with developers to find out what works well and what doesn t so that you can avoid those false positives   A good start  Always design gestures tied to a particular context or conditions that need to be met  Is music currently playing  Then the gesture triggers something  If not  it does nothing   Time is an important factor to differentiate a gesture from accidental hand movements  For instance  if I point at an object for more than one second  it means I actually want to interact with it   Distance is another one  If you re designing an interactive installation for a museum or visitor center  you d probably want it to recognize the gestures of people who are close enough to engage  as opposed to those of bystanders in the distance   Avoid fatigue  As obvious as it may sound  it s not always so easy to perceive the impact of gesturing  You need to observe your users again and again to get a real feeling about the experience you re creating   Simple points to remember   Unless you re designing a physical game or exercise  make sure people don t need to raise and hold their hands up too often or for too long Ensure that the mapping between hand trajectory and distance covered on the UI is comfortable  especially for large screens  This means that users can point to any part of the screen without any strain  The use of 2 hands generates less fatigue than a single handed interaction  You could use one hand as the dominant hand to initiate an interaction  showing a slider  for instance   Then use the second hand as support  adjusting the value of that slider   Consider that you don t need to do everything with a single hand  and explore alternative combinations   Be consistent and enable the same action with any hand  Finally  any gesture a user can trigger with their right hand should also be possible with their left hand  More than accommodating both the right handed and left handed among us  this consistency supports learning and adoption  So if you ve learned a gesture  you can start with either hand no need to memorize which one it was   Consistency needs to run all across your concept  just like with any UX project  After creating successful combinations of gesture   action  consider whether you need to enable any similar actions in other use cases  Users would expect to use the same gesture for those once they become familiar   Aim to create a consistent gestural language that s easy to discover and remember   With these design guidelines for gestural interaction in hand  you can start exploring this relatively uncharted creative space  Once you understand the differences  work towards combining air gestures with touch to create unique and fluid user interactions,"[636 1304 1228 1161 853 229 113 924 209 1356 616]"

750,training-dataset/business/27.txt,business,Apply This Simple Thought Exercise Before Creating ContentIf you re a content marketer that s struggling to convert leads to customers  ask yourself a very simple question before creating your next piece of content    Would I want another company to post this exact content on their own website    If the answer is no  then the content is not worth creating  and you re thinking wrongly about content marketing and your company s value proposition  To understand why  consider the reason that customers purchase anything  It s not because they want whatever widget you re selling  but rather because they want what the widget will enable them to do  You ve probably seen this hit graphic  but instead of laughing  focus on the ramifications it has   Image source  Samuel Hulick  You cannot hope to sell the offering of superpower infusing plants if you do not first convince customers of the aspirational value of destroying obstacles with fireballs  They are intrinsically connected  According to extensive research  the most impactful type of content is that which communicates the benefits of the aspirational value that your offering enables  You can only convert a lead into a buyer after they believe in those benefits   HubSpot can t sell their CRM until they convince prospective buyers to believe in the benefits of inbound marketing  Atlassian can t sell their project management software until they convince prospective buyers to believe in the benefits of agile development  Blue Apron can t sell their subscription ingredient boxes until they convince prospective buyers to believe in the benefits of cooking meals at home   Your content marketing efforts should focus on the benefits of the unique aspirational value that your company s offering enables  The more people that believe in the benefits  the more ready buyers you have available  The purpose of gating content behind landing pages is merely to make the two way interaction with believers a little more convenient  But if your content emphasizes the benefits of the aspirational value  it ll still be effective if someone literally steals it and posts it elsewhere  Perhaps even more so   My company sells a platform for on demand user research  A product team only buys our offering if they believe in the benefits of rapid user research  namely that it mitigates risk  leads to smarter product decisions  and keeps key stakeholders aligned  Therefore  all of our blog posts  reports  and efforts either evangelize those benefits or connect existing believers to our company s offering   So when someone fills out a contact form to download a report from our website  I don t care when I see them share it freely on a Slack forum  I m actually happy to see it  They re essentially a third party advocating for the benefits of an aspirational value which we can uniquely deliver   There are certainly other legitimate content marketing goals  like creating engaging or entertaining posts that drive traffic and subscribers  Such initiatives don t evangelize an aspirational value but can serve useful purposes like building lists of potentially relevant people  However  if the goal is to convert leads to buyers  only create content that first passes the litmus test I ve described above   Author s note  If you don t know how to create such content  it s possible that you aren t yet able to properly articulate the aspirational value or benefits enabled by your company s offering  Or if you think that competitors would benefit from publishing the same content  it s possible that your company doesn t enable a unique aspirational value  In either case  content marketing is not going to remedy the situation anyway  For the former  consider talking to customers and testing content marketing assumptions  For the latter  advertising is probably a better investment   This is a guest post by Nis Frome  Co Founder and Content Lead at Alpha   Join thousands of DOERS reading the Raise the Bar newsletter  A daily digest of timely  must read posts on sales  marketing  and growth engineering   Also published on Medium,"[750 209 924 309 1228 1304 783 113 853 907 539]"
783,training-dataset/business/1135.txt,business,4 Horrible Content Marketing Mistakes That Have Cost Us MillionsWe ve learned a lot from our fails  These four taught us some of our hardest lessons   In millions of unique visits to this blog  we ve learned a thing or two about how to drive traffic through content   And with the blog being by a huge margin our biggest source of new customers  we ve learned a bit about converting blog traffic  too   We ve done some stuff right  and a lot of stuff wrong  especially in the beginning    I can point to four big mistakes that have cost us dearly  Had we avoided them  by my count  using the performance improvements we ve seen after correcting those mistakes   our blog would be at least triple its current size  and would have resulted in hundreds of thousands more signups and millions more in revenue by now   I hope that by sharing the biggest mistakes we made early on  I can help you avoid the fails and start reaping these same benefits   Mistake  1  Not using your blog to grow your business  Your blog posts aren t sales pitches  And that s a good thing  because your posts should be free  high value resources that will help readers solve their problems before they buy   But as a business  you need to grow  And if you re not leveraging your blog for growth  then it s not an asset to your business   Now  that doesn t mean you have to write posts to pitch your readers  we never have   But until a few months ago  we made very little effort to turn readers into customers   And that was a mistake  How do I know   Because as soon as we started to deliberately and directly offer Groove to blog subscribers  we started getting significantly more signups   Here s what we did   In the past  when a reader signed up for our email list  they d get an email welcoming them to the list  and that was it  No pitch   Now  when a reader signs up  they re taken to a landing page that we built just for blog readers   It s highly targeted  it thanks the reader for enjoying our blog  shares similar content to what they just read to get them more engaged with our blog  explains what Groove is  and offers them a special extended trial that isn t available on our main site   We ve started to use the same approach for our guest blogging  too  Before  readers who clicked on links to Groove in our guest posts would be taken to our homepage   Now  we send them to a targeted landing page  customized for each guest blog   For example  when we wrote a guest post on the Buffer blog  rather than sending readers to our homepage  we built a custom offer page for Buffer readers   Of the traffic that reached that page  more than 15  of them signed up for an extended free trial of Groove   Depending on where our content appears  this landing page converts anywhere from 5 to nearly 20 percent of visitors into Groove free trial users   Mistake  2  Spending too much time writing  When we first started blogging well before the Groove blog was in its current iteration we did just that  we blogged   We wrote post after post  and kept getting frustrated that we weren t getting any traffic or shares   95  of our time spent on the blog was on writing  The other 5  was spent on some scattered Tweets and emails to try and get the content in front of others   As we later learned  that was a huge mistake   When we finally launched the Journey to  100K blog  we did a ton of research on content marketing and studied how other companies leveraged blogs for traffic and conversions   One of the most surprising lessons was just how much more to successful blogging there was than  well  blogging   The most successful content marketers I talked to all said the same thing  spend at least as much time promoting your content as you do writing it   To learn how we promoted our content  check out the details  including scripts  that we published in our influencer engagement plan   In short  we spent many hours doing research and compiling a list of the influencers that we thought our target audience would follow  Then we spent time building relationships with those influencers  becoming active in their blog comment sections  not with link spam  but with genuine  high value discussion  and sending them to be released drafts of our blog posts for feedback  The notes we got were invaluable and helped us make huge improvements to the content  Just as importantly  when we published the posts  the people who helped us improve them were more than happy to share them with the world   Our outreach ended up leading to the blog getting more than 1 000 subscribers within 24 hours  and more than 5 000 after the first week  a big change from our previous flops   Mistake  3  Making it too hard for people to sign up  I knew we were doing something wrong when I got this email   If you re not making it ridiculously easy for people to subscribe to your email list  and you do have an email list  right    you re cheating yourself of loyal  long term readers   Soon after I got that email  we put a prominent sign up form at the end of every post with a direct call to action that made it clear why the reader should sign up   That form replaced our old  boring sidebar form   The result  The new form nearly tripled our signup rate overnight   And we re not the only ones   Noah Kagan  founder of AppSumo  set out to try and capture more email subscribers to his site  OkDork   The change that made the biggest impact on signup conversion rates   Adding a big  unmissable signup form to his homepage   His conversation rate went from 3  to around 5   nearly doubling with one simple change   This is an area where we re continuing to improve  but even the small changes we ve made have led to big impact   Mistake  4  Letting people forget about you  Are your readers hearing from you regularly   If not  there s a good chance they re forgetting about you   Here s why that s bad   A year ago  when we posted once every two to three weeks  our open rates were low  averaging around 15   and our unsubscribe rate was higher  around 3   than it should ve been   When we started posting and emailing weekly  both stats improved significantly  open rates more than tripled to nearly 50   and unsubscribes are down to under 1    Becoming a regular presence in your readers  lives keeps them engaged and eager to read your content  Being erratic and disappearing from their inboxes for weeks at a time makes your email just another annoyance they didn t expect   How often should you post   Unfortunately  as far as I can tell  there s no single best answer here  Derek Halpern says a few times a month is fine  Neil Patel  on the other hand  writes 8 blog posts a week  I m exhausted just typing that    But whatever rhythm you find works best for you and really  the best way to know this is to test what works for your unique audience  make sure your readers get used to hearing from you regularly  They ll learn to expect your emails and posts  and you ll get the benefit of having a loyal  engaged audience   How to Apply This to Your Business  Just like anything in business  blogging is a learned skill   Even  successful  bloggers make mistakes  At Groove  we still screw up all the time  and not every post is a hit   But we learn from our mistakes  we move on  and we do better next time   It takes effort  practice and a whole lot of mistakes to get things right and start turning your blog into a serious driver of new customers   At least it did for us   But hopefully  by reading this and doing a checkup of your own blog to correct any of these mistakes that you re making  you can avoid a painful part of the learning process   A different version of this post first appeared as a guest post on the Unbounce blog,"[783 1304 209 924 853 309 113 907 539 750 62]"
853,training-dataset/product/471.txt,product,7 Strategies to Get It Right the First TimeIn this guest blog post  Shawn Parrotte  Marketing Manager at Designli and friend of the Founder Institute  dives deep into the world of SEO and provides you with expert tips on how to make your startup easier to find on the internet   It s tragic  but on the internet  even the best products can go unnoticed  Like a tree falling in an abandoned forest with no one around to hear  if you launch a product and no one can find it  will it even make an impact   Say you ve created a product you know will benefit someone  Hundreds  probably thousands of hours were spent planning  coding  testing  re testing  debugging  and designing it  You re down to the last phase  the launch   But  if you re like a lot of startups  marketing doesn t come naturally  You know your stuff   but maybe your  stuff  just isn t knowing how to get people to your product  That s okay  No one can be an expert at everything   But here s the thing about digital marketing  even though social media gets all the attention  search engines still hold the keys to the kingdom  Understanding and implementing the basics of search engine optimization at the early stages of your startup will not only help your site rank better from day one  but will give you a solid foundation if you need to hand off the responsibility as your team grows   That s why we ve made this quick SEO guide specifically for startups  So you can rock your product launch  build your audience  and grow your startup   If you have a good handle on how search engines work already  feel free to jump straight to our 7 strategies  If not  let s dig into how Google  Bing  and the rest do their thing   What is SEO  really   Let s look closely at how Google actually works  A person decides they need something  some information  a solution  a product  and  if they re like 75  of online US users  they ll type a search query into the Google search bar in hopes of finding what they re looking for  From Google s results on the SERP  search engine results page   they choose the website or webpage that best suits their request   Search Engine Optimization  SEO  studies how search engines like Google select pages to include in their results and uses that data to optimize a web page for that search engine   Simple  right   Well  yes and no  The algorithms used by search engine engineers are fantastically complex  but many of the factors they weight you have a lot of control over   How search engines work  A search engine s goal is to serve the  best  results to the user  and it s this list of  best  results that keep SEO researchers up at night  How does the search engine decide what s best  What data is included in their calculations  And what may hurt a website s rankings   To answer these questions  we need to ask   What does a search engine do    Well  it has two main jobs   Crawling and Indexing webpages  building a map of the internet   Providing users information  locating and serving the best spots on the map   As the engine crawls web pages  the links provide the  routes  or  highways  to drive to the next  city   the next page  Crawling one page locates all the links on that page  and the search engine s  spiders  follow each link to the following page  And this keeps going until there are no more pages to be found   When the spiders follow the links  they build a map  or an index  of the web  Each page is assigned a spot in this index  and the search engine returns the most relevant information for the user based on their algorithm   This is your most important SEO element   How do you get a good spot in the index  Popularity  ultimately  But it makes sense  right  The more people visiting a particular site and sharing their content  the more useful it must be  It s a pretty reliable metric for providing useful sites to searchers  but as Google s algorithm evolves other factors become important too   But when thinking about reverse engineering popularity online  here s the most important equation you need when for SEO for your site    Valuable Content   Viral Sharing   Relevance    Higher SERP Ranking  If you re creating content that is valuable to an audience   this could mean blog posts  infographics  podcasts  videos  and more   they ll naturally share your links around the internet  As your content gets consumed by more people and they link back to you when they share it  more roads will lead to your spot on the map  i e  your pages in the search index  As your site s value and influence builds  search engines translate this as relevance  And more relevance means better results   This may be a little too simple  but if you ignore the quality of your content  your SEO is dead    no one wants to be annoyed with junk content that s boring  difficult  or irrelevant   So if content isn t everything  what else is there   SEO building blocks for startups  Okay  so while good  shareable content is a must have  you need a handle on the other pieces of SEO to get your site ranked  Here s what you need to know to get your startup in front of your target audience   On page SEO vs Off page SEO  Simply put  your website has two types of SEO to help it get seen  on page and off page  On page SEO consists of making your website and it s content easy to understand and navigate for search engines  This means optimizing web copy  the page navigation  url structure  and metadata  Off page SEO is how other pages link to yours  your trust ranking  social influence and the site s personal information   Keywords tell search engines what your page is about  When you know the kinds of language that your target audience uses when they want to find your product or service  you can then use those phrases directly in the copy on your site  Don t go overboard with  keyword stuffing  because Google can easily know when you do that and will penalize you for it  But by naturally including the targeted keywords and phrases that matter to your business into the text you ll be sure that the search engines know what the page is about   But just having the keywords on your text is not enough  Search engines must be able to find those keywords and know how they re used  That s where knowing some HTML comes in handy   Code tells search engines how to read your page  Your site s code tells spiders what to crawl  what they re crawling and where to go when they re done  If you re not comfortable with coding  invest in someone who knows what they re doing  It s worth it   The main elements you need to be familiar with are   Title tags  H1s   H2s  URL structure  Meta Description  Image Alt tags  Make sure you re using targeted keywords in each of these so you don t confuse the search engine algorithms   Links tell search engines where to find your page   and a whole lot more  Links can be your best friend or they can sink you quickly  There are two types of links important to SEO  outbound and inbound   Outbound links are those links you place in your content that  link out  to other sites  Glance through this article  and you ll find several outbound links in each section  The most important factor is where these links go   Links to real  relevant  accessible and trusted content are good  Links to garbage are not  As a rule  only link to content and sites your reader will find valuable   Inbound links are off page links that point to your site  Also known as backlinks  these tell search engines how useful your page is  Getting an inbound link from a trusted site can boost your trust ranking and prove to search engines your site is considered reliable by its users   As you promote your site  you ll hear a lot about link building campaigns  These are campaigns focused on building inbound links to your site to increase your influence and boost your ranking  Moz com has a great resource on launching and maintaining a successful link bulding campaign   7 SEO Strategies for early startup success  Okay  so we re clear on the basics  Now how do you get your startup on the SEO map  Here are 7 quick tips   1  Write valuable content  If you produce content your audience needs  make it easy for them to find  and share it freely  you can t help but attract a loyal  buying mob    the goal of every startup  Do the opposite  and you ll type your fingers raw   all alone   Include keywords in your titles and headlines  Use keywords around your links  instead of  click here      take a look at the links throughout this post  Each one has anchor text to tell you what you ll find on the other side    Post new content or update your existing content regularly   Quality over quantity  This is huge  Bring readers back for your awesome content and make it irresistible to share   Don t scrimp on your content during your startup  Invest in a good writer who can connect with your audience and give you a trustworthy voice   2  Plan your keywords carefully  Keywords are really misunderstood  Choosing your keywords based on your visitor s buying stage can yield exciting growth for startups  There a three kinds of keywords   Transaction   I want to buy a tv or I want to stream a movie  Information   I want to know who makes the best pita in Southie  Navigation   I want to go to Instagram or my favorite online shop   Specific is better  Think about it  if you rank high for  coffee   how many users typing simply  coffee  in their search bars are looking to buy your roast  How about ranking for  small batch coffee roasters  or  small batch coffee roasters in Phoenix   Now you have someone looking for your specific product and maybe even in your specific location  Even better  you ve just narrowed the competition for your keyword   These are known as longtail keywords  When Google auto completes your searches  those are longtail keywords you could be ranking for  They tell you what stage of the buying process your searchers are in   Generally speaking  the more specific the keyword  the closer to buying   3  Speak your audience s language  SEO isn t all about keywords  I know I ve stressed keywords    and they are important    but you can have all the keywords perfectly placed and still not have content your audience connects with   Demian Farnworth explains what SEO keyword research really means    Keyword research is  about knowing your audience so well that you learn which words will grab their attention  earn their trust  and persuade them to subscribe to your newsletter  download your book  buy your product    Now think about your audience  As a startup focusing on SEO  maybe you don t know your audience well enough to speak like them  Fix that   Read what they read  Follow who they follow on social media  Watch their favorite movies and tv shows  Find them on Youtube and listen  Physically hang out where they hang out  Send a survey  Listen   Find those keywords and how they actually use them  Then  build high quality content around those words  and your audience will find you   That s SEO keyword research   4  Link to your content with purpose  The coveted backlink is a startup s bread and butter    and a shady link building campaign can be it s guillotine  If you re outsourcing this  do your research to make sure the company is legit   Real and relevant  This should go without saying  but there s a reason I m saying it  Real links actually go where the user expects them to go  And don t redirect  Google hates that   Include relevant links to quality sites that you find useful and that your readers find useful   Share your content on social media to build backlinks and followers   Use your anchor text wisely  Instead of  click here   imbed your link in a description of what the reader will find  Moz com has a great article on smart SEO link practice   see what I did there    Earn quality links  Build relationships with influencers via social media  commenting on their blogs or finding them at conferences and networking events  As long as you approach this with the attitude of genuine interest and adding value  you can get links from trusted sites and individuals  That s kind of a big deal with the Google gods   Guest blog to borrow an audience  When you guest blog on a relevant site  you get to donate a link  Now you have a link to your site from your guest blog site  and viola  Your score jumps  If you can frame your startup in a way that solves a problem for that site s audience  the owner will often be happy to have you post the article   5  Get the little things right  The technical side of SEO can get overwhelming  but just getting the basics right can put you miles ahead of the competition  Moz com lays out SEO code as simply as I ve seen  and here are some key takeaways you can get started on right away   Meta descriptions are powerful click builders  These are the little descriptions that show up on the SERP after the web page title  Instead of whatever is at the top of your page going there   if this page is not displaying properly     take advantage of it by giving the user a tasty preview of your content   HTML tags show a crawler where to look  Keep your keywords inside HTML  not in video or rich text where they can t find it   and they can be easily crawled  Use the heading tags in order on your page  and include keywords within the tags   Don t let slow pages turn your traffic away  Keep your site streamlined  so your readers aren t waiting on your super HD graphics to download before they can get to your product  Especially with the increase in mobile users  download speed is critical  Link out to your non essential videos and HD photos to improve your overall site s speed   Structuring your page URL with keywords lets a user know what to expect on that page  Keep it short and human friendly  Try to avoid using parameters  those   id 44  mark ups that show up in your search bar   If it looks clean and contains the user s keyword  it puts your user at ease  Rand Fishkin lays out some good URL principles in his article on Moz com   Keep your sitemap clean and current  Stephen Spencer has a short but useful article on optimizing your sitemap for SEO  Crawling your site first can help you fix any errors Google would find later    duplicate content  dead links  etc  You can generate a sitemap with a plugin  and there a ton of options out there  But once you create it  keep it current by updating links daily  If you re following the fresh content rule and posting regularly  staying on top of your sitemap gives Google the best chance possible to find and index your content quickly   6  Don t forget your app  Way back in 2015  mobile searches on Google had already begun to dominate the market  so by 2016  Google began indexing apps to include on their SERP  That means your startup s app must be SEO focused  too   Search Engine Land is a great resource for app SEO  and here are a few key takeaways from one of their older but better  SEO for apps  articles   Place your most relevant keyword in the title   Kissmetrics points out a 10 3  increase in search rankings for apps with keyword conscious titles  And do NOT change your title to keep up with new keywords  Update your description and profile page to adapt to your market s keyword relevance   Link to your app profile page from your site   The profile page and the number of downloads provide a majority of Google s criteria  Use your best keywords to make your profile page easy to find   Use your startup s name in the anchor text of your link   Just like we talked about  you re optimizing your anchor text for all your links  right   Provide a download link at the top of your web page   Make it easy to download the platform specific app for your visitor  The web is being overrun by mobile users  so promoting your app is a must   Improve your ratings and reviews   Follow up surveys and in app feedback can provide invaluable insights into your users  Users like to vent    just make sure your users don t vent in their ratings  Offer an in app feedback or help feature where problems can be resolved without hitting the review stage  Downloads and reviews are huge to your app s ranking  Don t be afraid to encourage your happy users to put in a good word for you   Don t forget to categorize   Categorizing and sub categorizing your app makes it easy for the picky user to find  Like longtail keywords  if a user is looking for an app that does exactly what your app does  placing it in the correct category makes it easy for them to find it   Write an SEO healthy app description page   Use your best practice for SEO in your description page  Write a concise description in our audience s language  and include keywords most relevant to your market and product   With nearly 270 billion app downloads projected for 2017  your startup s app must be optimized to be competitive  Don t treat your app as second rate to your website  It could be that more users see your app than your site in the very near future   7  Always be agile  SEO is not a one and done process  Just scroll through Kim Speier s  quick  history of Google s algorithmic updates  and you ll see the search giant s engineers are working overtime to give online users the best experience possible   What does this mean for your startup  Adopt an agile SEO strategy early  Keep tweaking  but don t obsess   Fresh content ranks well  and keep up to speed on your keyword research  Know your audience s newest longtail keywords  and focus on ranking well for those   SEO for startups is simple  Produce good stuff  Remember  Google s goal is to find the best content for your audience  That means your job is to produce the best content you can  and to make that content easy for Google to find   Produce  optimize  share  repeat  Google will find your awesomely designed product    just make sure they

924,training-dataset/business/1378.txt,business,The  Adjective   Number  Things You Need to Know About ClickbaitWhile running the real estate blog for Trulia  then marketing manager Tara Nicholle Nelson got a surprising email  A woman wrote in to tell her that a Trulia blog post saved her marriage  It wasn t about the perfect combo of beds and bathrooms or whether to buy a Craftsman or a Colonial  It instead outlined the variables that make up one s vision of a home   a proxy for how buyers wanted to live after they bought a home  The article s title clearly defined what would follow after the click   and delivered  Having found the advice  the woman and her partner changed the tenor of their conversation  They stopped quibbling about specific properties and started talking about how they wanted to live together  That s the impact that actionable content paired with faithful headlines can have  Under Nelson s watch  the blog s readership grew to 11 million regular readers  Since  Nelson has become an expert in building branded content that can reach customers and improve their lives   After Trulia  Nelson was the VP of Marketing for MyFitnessPal  where she more than doubled users to 100 million  drove a 25  increase in user engagement and oversaw the eventual  475 million acquisition by Under Armour  She then became VP of Marketing at Under Armour Connected Fitness  where she oversaw growth  engagement  content marketing and user insights  Nelson now consults on these topics and has written The Transformational Consumer  a book about building brands and customer engagement by tapping into the human aspiration for a better life   Here  Nelson talks about how to combat clickbait and create real engagement through content  She outlines the top mistake companies make in content marketing and the process to mapping your customers  journeys in order to create content that is actionable and impactful   The Single Biggest Mistake in Content  The biggest trap Nelson sees content makers fall into is this  they create clickbait   content that lures in a reader  typically with a suggestive headline  then fails to deliver material that s promised  Saddled with the burden of demonstrating growth  marketers run themselves ragged on a content hamster wheel  feeding the beast of more posts and more clicks  They then write evermore bombastic headlines in a desperate bid to hit their KPIs   typically growth in clicks  views  likes  traffic and email list size   Stop  Nelson says  Just stop    People find clickbait detestable  Abhorrent  The paradox is that people generally hate clickbait the most right after they click on it  I call this the Clickbait Conundrum  People hate it  but it works  The online content powers that be have taken stab after stab at legislating its extinction for years  Google has long sought to demote content farms into oblivion  Not long ago  Facebook announced algorithm changes designed to minimize exposure of headlines that  withhold information required to understand what the content of the article is  or  create misleading expectations for the reader    Nelson says   In the war against Internet tomfoolery  I d say these shots were fired with equal aim at brand content publishers as at online media outlets  Consider this  the volume of brand published content was up 35  in 2015  yet consumer engagement with that content was down by 17   Yet 77  of brands surveyed at the end of the year by Content Marketing Institute and MarketingProfs report that they were planning to create even more content this year than last    Not everyone sets out to publish clickbait   I see this a lot when brands first invest in and launch a content program  Building a content team is often an inspired decision  so the content is inspired  too   at first  Then someone tinkers with headlines and puts KPIs on the program that are misguided  The only way the team knows to meet them is to publish more and publish more bait y headlines   Nelson says   You then see content performance decline and ultimately readers stop clicking  That s the danger for most companies  Investing to build a relationship with an audience via content that either never really catches spark or has an initial flare of engagement followed by dramatically diminishing returns over time as readers learn your headlines can t be trusted    Trust is earned in drips and lost in buckets  Every clickbait headline endangers customer trust   Why Clickbait Happens  Clickbait is tough to quit  Nelson admits   Branded content publishers don t do clickbait for the heck of it  They do it because people click the links and add their email addresses to the popup form fields to get to the content behind the gates  It s growth above all else    Below  she spells out here the top reasons companies publish clickbait   intentionally or unwittingly   instead of putting out deeply engaging content   They prioritize growth over engagement  This is a matter of playing a long versus short game   There s the short game of hitting quantity targets  And then there s the long game of building quality  engagement  loyalty  love and respect  Given the choice  I d choose engagement over growth every time   Nelson says    Companies often mistake clicks with engagement  But it s all for nothing if people leave your content disgusted  You want readers to open your messages regularly  share the content  download your app  buy your product and use it over and over again  You can buy growth through big ad spends  but you can t buy engagement  That requires a steadfast commitment to quality over quantity    They fixate on clicks over relationship building  Clickbait creators forget or ignore the real people behind the traffic numbers   The biggest lever we all have at our disposal is the undying human longing for transformation  It s the most powerful motivation people have for buying products and consuming content  Their strongest desire is to live healthier  wealthier and wiser life  That s why every New Year resolutions list looks exactly the same  eat less  earn more  save more  exercise more  Yet it s hard to make good habits and break bad habits   Nelson says   There s a gap between what we know we need to do   eat less sugar  work out  save more   and what we actually do  That gap is a massive opportunity to provide solutions to these challenges with products and especially with content    The content team on the frontlines aren t able or willing to push back  The fault of clickbait isn t on your team  Nelson says   it s on the leadership   The junior members of your content team know that what they re being asked to do doesn t work in the long run  but they ll work to drive very short term metrics  These people  who I talk to all the time  do not feel empowered to push back  They may not be fully represented at the leadership table or executive team   Nelson says   So they A B test for the clickiest headlines  putting up large numbers of posts and clicks  and feel good about having hit targets  Until Facebook says  no more clickbait   and the freak outs commence    It s easier to do clickbait and it s scarier to go deep with people  But I can tell you that deep calls unto deep   and that drives engagement   Your Customer Map is the Path Forward  If you re stuck on the clickbait treadmill or otherwise struggling to build engagement through content  trust Nelson when she says there s a better way  In particular  she implores marketers to build what s called a customer map   Sketch out your customer s actual  everyday struggle to solve the problem your company exists to solve  Circle points of friction  How do their motivations  capabilities and aspirations relieve or exacerbate these points  The goal is to become an expert in how they do or do not achieve their goals   says Nelson   This isn t easy  but it unlocks an incredibly rich trove of fodder for creating content that people will actually be eager and excited to read  What you get out of a customer map can literally change lives    Here s how this strategy worked for MyFitnessPal   First  we mapped a person s journey from unhealthy to healthy  We broke it down into four stages  starting with inertia and ending with the phase at which people default to healthy behavior and are resilient to being derailed   Nelson says   It got us clear on where we could reduce friction on a customer s path to good health    During the process  her team and she noted common hurdles to losing weight  challenges and costs around cooking healthy and the difficulty of logging restaurant food   We heard moms talking about how they could  feed their families on  20  at all of the fast food restaurants  so we started posting meal plans and recipes with that sort of language in the title  We did deep research on what prevented people from cooking   which is a major success factor of developing a healthy life   and created basic cooking skills videos and a deep  deep recipe program that represented some of our top performing content  The product team was focused on the same customer journey  so they were building restaurant logging features and recipe logging functionality at the same time  In the end  the program we built drove a 22  increase in customer engagement  strictly with content  in less than a year    A customer map can play a crucial role in building enduring content programs and even product features  In particular  they can be useful beyond content and used by the whole company  from HR to marketing to product  Nelson lays out the following guidelines for building a great map   Draw a line from  problem plagued  to  problem solved   Your customer s journey isn t the same as their lifecycle with your brand or product   The journey you need to map is their path from having the problem   that your company exists to solve   to being free of it   Nelson says   For example  a customer s journey could start with wanting to read more  and end with completing a book a month with the help of a service like Audible  You must understand every step they make along the way   each hurdle or speed bump they face  Those moments are times they re looking for solutions and where content and products will resonate    Expand your definition of a customer  Your customers  for purposes of mapping their journey  is everyone who solves the big  human scale problem your company exists to address   If you re Slack  that problem is doing your best work efficiently  so you can live your best life  If you re CVS  that problem might be living a healthier life than you do currently   Nelson says   Most companies only research existing customers  which is so dangerously limiting  If you want your content to reach people beyond your walled gardens  don t build your average customer personas around the opinions of people you already engage    Spot patterns and parallels   Your customer journey map should spot the near universal stages your customers experience  as characterized by their behaviors  how they feel  what they want  what they think they need at each stage  Pay special attention to two big categories of patterns  what are the things that get people stuck  and what are the things that get them unstuck   Nelson says   Content that addresses those topics will get reads and shares  You re essentially looking for highly specific problems in people s lives  and presenting a solution that actually works  This isn t easy  but it works time and time again    Tara Nicholle Nelson  Nelson looks for the following patterns when talking to customers to build out maps   Stages  Look for clear delineations in a person s journey to understand how people progress through stages to solve their problem   The stages of their journey define the challenges they face that you can solve with content   Nelson says   At Trulia  we found five stages   wanting to buy a house  researching mortgages  dream home shopping  discouragement from the buying process  then either the sale or failing to buy a home  Understanding that helped us build content for each part of a homebuyer s path    Micro moments  Find micro moments  a term coined by Google  as moments when customers look to their devices   typically their phones   to research what they need to know  go to  do or buy   Find these and build content in response to these  Really hone in the specifics  What triggers them  What are they looking for  Where are they when the thought occurs to them   Nelson asks   For example  at Trulia we found that when people were paid on the 15th of each month  they would check their bank accounts  Seeing their savings would trigger a search on the average size of a down payment  We were able to develop content that targeted a reader in that very specific moment  and it paid off with an uptick in email newsletter opens  blog post views and reader comments    Resistance and progress triggers   Look for the things that get people stuck and unstuck along the way   Inventory these pretty intensely  You d be surprised at how universal they turn out to be  Most of the time  people say the same things over and over again   Nelson says   In the case of healthy living  it s  I don t have time to work out   or  I don t know how to cook   Your collection of these feeds into the solutions you can offer with content  It also helps you develop an overarching set of big picture messages    Natural language  Write down how your customers talk  then phrase your content in the same way   Not phrases people say time and again as they share their experience with a problem  How customers describe their problems gives clues on how to translate your content and articulate it back in their terms   Nelson says   This is the difference between publishing  Exercises for People With Knee Injuries  and  Workouts for Bad Knees   We found that no one with knee problems says I have a knee injury   people say  I have bad knees   Tweaking that sort of phrase  along with some other content optimizations  helped us boost email opens  clickthroughs and visits to the blog by as much as 20     Focus on the Right Metrics and Messaging  Your goal  instead of just piling up clicks  is to nail down the right metrics and focus on improving them  At the same time  a good content program has safeguards and well defined overarching themes   You re looking for engagement  not clicks  It s so vital to understand the difference between the two  The whole point of a content program is to build brand respect  loyalty and love   Nelson says   To do that  you have to have metrics that indicate actual engagement of your particular customer  and ignore the ones that don t  It s also so important to be centered   to really understand the story you re trying to tell  and whether or not that story is resonating    Here s Nelson s step by step breakdown on the steps you should be taking to get those components right   Create message pillars  These are your greatest guardrail from mission or clickbait creep  and message pillars often come out of resistance and progress triggers   You want to create recurring  higher level story points and messages that span an entire content program  I often work with companies on using the Story Spine tool to build out a content program s overarching narrative and break it down into recurring pillars   Nelson says   A set of pillars  for example  might be  cooking is crucial to weight loss  and  choose healthy indulgences over junk food   Guide your content team to what messages every post should telegraph  This helps you create a consistency in every interaction with readers    Choose and avoid taboo messages  Establish no go zones for your content   These are concepts you don t publish  as an outgrowth of brand positioning and message pillars  This is where you return to to truly understanding your customer s journey  as well as what they need and when   Nelson says   These messages lead to content that fails to help them or makes the problem worse   Some examples of taboo messages at MyFitnessPal include    The One Thing You Need To  posts  which sell  silver bullets  and oversimplify the complexity of real weight and health journeys  Topics that trigger shame  Extremely thin or unrealistic body representations in imagery  Eating trends not approved by in house nutritionists  Institute purpose driven KPIs  Measure real engagement instead of relying on false approximations like opens  clicks and traffic growth   While those are important to watch and track  the whole point of a content program is to build an ongoing connection with customers that causes them to care about  buy  use and share your content and products   Nelson says  She recommends that companies pay attention instead to the following KPIs   Shares  This represents virality  and drives audience reach and growth   Repeat to unique visit ratio  This should increase over time as people return to your content and it becomes a part of their consumption habits   Time on the site  blog or app  As a basic engagement metric and indicator of quality  this figure also guards against clickbait  which people will quickly abandon   Net promoter score  NPS   This number quantifies how likely people are to tell others about your brand  product or content   Word of mouth referrals  As this number grows  the lifetime value of your customers increases as the cost of acquiring them decreases  Word of mouth referrals are powerful   and free   Social media shares  This figure is another indicator of virality and engagement  and you ll want it to be high   it s one way to demonstrate impact   Unsubscribes  It s paramount that this number stay low  If it s not  your content isn t creating value   Comment and product sentiment  including reviews  User generated content like this reflects how deeply engaged readers are with your product or content  and can make or break e commerce goals   it s critical that they be favorable   Enlist a second editor and experts as a gut check  Make sure you re examining everything before it publishes   When I run a content program  I actually sit in on editorial calendar meetings and review the calendar for titles that spark concern  It s easier to train people about what not to publish in real time   Nelson says   It can also be helpful for sensitive subject matter content to be created or reviewed by subject matter experts or professionals  At MyFitnessPal  we had two nutritionists on the content team  specifically to manage that and ultimately  to create a lot of the nutrition content themselves    It s simple  If you promise people something they want  deliver it  And give it to them with as few barriers as possible   Bringing it All Together  If you take one piece of advice from Nelson s counsel  it s to stop publishing clickbait  You ll think it s a magic carpet until the rug is pulled out from under you  Instead  create customer maps to deeply understand their real world journeys  The segments of that journey are defined by different challenges  which are are pain points that you can and should address with your content strategy  Define message pillars and taboo messages  as well as involve experts in editorial oversight  Use the right KPIs and ditch bad ones  swap out open rates and clicks for more meaningful metrics like shares  unsubscribes or time on page    People are deeply interested in content that can improve their lives  The problem is that literally everyone claims they ve got it  The only way to distinguish yourself from the pack is to put in the work to study your customer s journey  But most won t do it because it s much easier to trigger a customer s reflex to click than commit to building a relationship that extends beyond the bottom of an article   says Nelson   But the gains go to those who think of their relationship with their customer as a storyline   then each post is only a touchpoint  not the endpoint  You ll clear the path for people to develop real love and trust for your brand  That s when more happy customers  a better brand image and a stronger reputation clicks into place   and that s the click worth working for

most important signals to search crawlers as to the topic of a page  While you can still get ranked by search engines without a title tag on a page  the search algorithms may miss the focus of the

decided to make a reservation at one of Berlin s finer restaurants  After spending a good amount of time checking out the reviews on Foursquare  I eventually settled on a place called Katz Orange  I hopped onto OpenTable and found a table for two at 8 PM  Score   In less than a minute I got a confirmation email in Inbox  informing me that the restaurant had received notice of my reservation and was eagerly awaiting my arrival  Shortly after  my phone buzzed and displayed a Google Maps notification  telling me to leave at 7 30 at the latest to be on time for my reservation   Upon tapping the notification  I was presented with the distance to the restaurant and a short reminder of my reservation  In addition  Maps suggested ordering an Uber for a comfortable trip to the restaurant   After a short and relaxing ride  the Uber dropped us off right at the restaurant  Perfectly on time  Just as Maps had estimated   In this scenario  Google was able to correctly anticipate and answer my needs before I even realized I had them  The reservation info was extracted from the email in Inbox  added to my calendar and linked to Maps  to later prompt me to leave on time and suggest taking an Uber  By leveraging the data available across multiple services and devices  Google managed to always stay one step ahead of me and satisfy any of my wants and needs in this situation   The anecdote illustrates what is likely the next big step for design  Anticipatory Design  Leveraging user data to assess  predict and answer their needs ahead of time  Designing to always be one step ahead   Not only did Google anticipate my needs in the highlighted scenario  they also never presented me with the choice to be reminded of my reservation  Nor did I request an estimated travel time from my apartment to the restaurant  From the moment I made the reservation to the point that Google prompted me to take an Uber  I was never once asked whether I would like to use any of these services  In fact  I wasn t even made aware that Google s integration with these services existed   And that s okay   Rather than informing me of all the available options and forcing me to make a decision on whether or not I d actually like to use these services  Google made this decision for me  And the experience ended up being delightful  Less choice  or no choice in this case  ended up being the better choice   As we move towards a  future without choice  as Jo l van Bodegraven puts it  design decisions become less focused on curating and presenting a selection of options  Rather  the focus is shifted towards preempting the user s every possible need   This goes against the conventional conception of product design  Traditionally  designers create a product that users interact with  whether it s by clicking on or physically touching the product  The user is presented with a specific amount of information and a range of options and is expected to choose one of these options  In products that are designed to anticipate the user s needs  this decision making is taken away from the user   This decrease in decision making for the user is a deliberate choice and a core characteristic of Anticipatory Design  It s aimed at lowering the cognitive load of taking almost 35 000 decisions a day  By automating the process  the stress of actually picking from any number of options is alleviated  It s all about designing systems that intelligently make decisions on behalf of the user   In the past we ve seen companies like Netflix and Amazon build systems that recommend new series or movies  or highlight products that we d probably like to buy based on viewing habits and past purchases  These types of recommendations are only the tip of the iceberg  They still require us to consciously make decisions from this tailored selection of options  The final decision still lies with the user   In many cases  these platforms complicate decision making even further  Rather than having to choose from a large variety of options in which only a handful are actually relevant to a user s specific wants  the user now has to choose from a small list of options that are specifically selected to suit their needs  As such  it becomes significantly harder to actually compare and choose between these options   Huge s Sophie Kleber highlights these prediction and recommendation platforms as initial steps in the evolution of anticipatory design  By building algorithms that collect  filter and smartly apply learnings from user generated data to the product  we re getting one step closer to products that are capable of taking beneficial decisions for the user   By focusing our attention on making decisions on behalf of the user  we consciously and deliberately move away from the concept of personalization  We step away from a time where seemingly every content delivery service seemed focused on serving an  individual   custom tailored version of the product   The era of personalization is coming to an end  Enter the era of automation   As we continue to focus our efforts on building smart  adaptive algorithms  the era of personalization will slowly come to an end  These algorithms will aid us in establishing patterns in individual and collective user behaviour and leveraging the knowledge of those patterns to serve individual users with the right amount of information at the right time    Content is king   wrote Bill Gates in 1996  Content  Gates argued  would be where  much of the real money  would be made on the Internet  And right he was  Most digital products stand and fall by the quality of their content  Content is the defining factor by which the quality of a product is assessed  It is why a company like Amazon would rather focus on delivering the most relevant and accurate content than posting a profit   With anticipatory design however  it can be argued that context  not content  is king  While this doesn t mean that content can be put on the backburner  there is a distinct shift in focus towards contextually aware algorithms   By continuously analyzing and assessing contextual data  we can assure that whichever decision is taken on the user s behalf and thus  whichever need is anticipated  is actually the right one  Based on this analysis  we can then decide what content we want to deliver   It is on this basis that digital assistants like Siri  Cortana or Google Assistant and their physical counterparts like Google Home or Amazon Echo are able to deliver the most relevant content to the user  These products are exposed to an extremely large amount of contextual data based on the user s commands and search queries  In turn  they can learn and adapt to an individual user s specific needs   Contextual awareness is also what enabled Google to provide the experience described in the opening paragraph  By interpreting the data available across their own platforms like Inbox and Maps  and third party platforms like OpenTable  they are able to leverage this immense wealth of information to preempt their user s needs and wants,"[1161 853 1304 924 1228 113 539 62 1047 309 636]"
1228,training-dataset/product/876.txt,product,Best Practices for Localisation15 Flares 15 Flares    Rahel Bailie  Chief Knowledge Officer at Scroll LLP  describes content as the  new front door  to your business  From the home page to the error message on your checkout  content enables customers to understand your product and connect with your brand  The process of localisation adapts your content to make it understandable and recognisable by different local markets  Examples of localisation range from translation through to updating cultural references within your content  It can quickly descend into a major headache  or appear an impossible task from the outset  without a clear process from the very first piece of content creation  Rahel s talk is a generous guide of best practices that will make creating and maintaining translations and localisations as painless as possible   Rahel first establishes the three key challenges of content    Content is important  It helps customers understand your product  services  instructions and ultimately your brand  We always say  content is king  but when it comes down to it product never treats  Content as king  and this will create difficulties for your entire business later down the line   It helps customers understand your product  services  instructions and ultimately your brand  We always say  content is king  but when it comes down to it product never treats  Content as king  and this will create difficulties for your entire business later down the line  Content exists as part of a life cycle  not part of a supply chain  The translation is not the final step of that feature  It will continually be improved and edited  Your processes need to be setup to handle these constant iterations and versions across your product   The translation is not the final step of that feature  It will continually be improved and edited  Your processes need to be setup to handle these constant iterations and versions across your product  Content can t be managed like data  Assumptions and associations generated by language changes dependent both on the reader and the context within which it is used  Unlike data  you can t chop and change sections without reference to its locality   To address these challenges  Rahel recommends following three key practices   Manage your source content well  If it s written poorly in the source it s going to localise badly  and probably cost more money to do so   Use plain language principles  Control the vocabulary  if you have a widget call it a widget everywhere  Avoid jargon  gestures  euphemisms which may translate badly  Colours  gestures and images matter  The symbolism of an image or theme will be understood differently dependent on the culture   To overcome this you should practice not only translation but transcreation  taking a core concept that you would like to communicate  abstracting it from the symbolism within your content and find a matching counterpart for it within your target country   If in doubt  test the source content via Google Translate as you re creating it   Maintain source control  Create a superset of source content translations  When content is duplicated in multiple places via translation  it can make fixing mistakes and errors a lengthy process  If you fix the content source in one place and have a superset of translations it enables you to   Translate it once and then re use the translation of that phrase or instruction across all outputs Fix it once in one place and then update simultaneously  Don t to be too granular when creating the source content sets as much of the meaning will depend on the surround text  At less than a sentence level you tend to lose nuances  To help maintain sentence level context it s also key to use standard semantic structure and metadata tagging as much as possible  For example  personal names in Western countries are made up of given name  middle name and surname but can be encoded surname  given name  and middle initial  It s useful to decide upon one of these structures and stick to it throughout your source control  even better  use metadata to specify exactly which one you mean   Three Critical Processes  Content development  You want technical communicators or user assistance writers who know the tools   don t let product managers or developers write it    Maintain consistency between grammar  structure  punctuation  tone and voice  Agile Development  Run content creation in parallel with code creation so that they can be tested together  Don t store your content in a database as it will lack the functionality that writers need  Transclude rather than copying and pasting in order to be able to edit only the source content  Translation Development  When planning translations make sure you don t only translate from language to language but also market to market  Automatic translation  Use translation memory in order to save costs as it can identify terms that you have translated already and so don t need to pay for again  Make sure you consolidate it into a single memory and are ownership of it as opposed to the translation

1304,training-dataset/product/1413.txt,product,How to craft more usable  useful  and engaging contentContent is about more than just words on a page  It s about conveying information  providing knowledge  and telling stories   In other words  it s about communication   Just like with any other type of communication  usability should be a key consideration with any content that we create and publish on the web  It should be designed  written  and formatted with the end user in mind   Unfortunately  too many companies simply think that creating a blog and publishing stuff words on a page is enough for success   But it s just not the case  Content that isn t usable isn t useful   Related  The ultimate guide to web content accessibility  Jakob Nielson s now famous eyescan study taught us a lot about the way people read on the internet  In particular that pages are read in an F pattern  meaning that we tend to skim the first few lines of a block of text and then jump down the page for the next entry point   This informs many of the principles that go along with good content user experience  And it shows us that the way content is presented is easily as important as the content itself   In this article  I ll discuss how you can use design as a tool for radically improving your content to make it more usable  useful  and engaging   Design and layout  One of the first and most critical components to creating great content is making it readable  This means paying attention to the styling of your page  the words  spacing  and layout   In particular  you want the content to be easy on the eyes and intuitive to read to skim   Create a comfortable reading line  Right at the top of the list for creating usable content is controlling the reading line  Or  how far your reader s eye will have to travel from left to right as he or she reads the words on your page   The reading line of your page will ultimately be dictated by 2 variables   Size of the font Width of the column  If you have a larger font size  then you ll need a wider column in order to achieve the same length of reading line  measured in characters   And  on the flip side  if your font is smaller  then you will want a narrow column to condense the reading line to make it more comfortable   Taken together  most experts suggest that each line of text contains between 45 and 75 characters for desktop computers and between 35 and 50 on mobile devices   If it s much longer than this  your readers will have fatigue and skip to the next line before the end  If it s shorter  the text will feel choppy and difficult to read   Because most users have high resolution devices and larger monitors  many sites now use larger font size  20 22px  with a wider column width  800 1000px   But any combination that results in readable font and a comfortable line length should be feasible   Set proper spacing and height  Secondly  the words on your page need to be easy to distinguish  but not so spaced out that it creates awkward space between each word  line  or paragraph   Notice how the spacing in this text makes everything clear  Each line is a comfortable distance apart and you know when a new word or paragraph begins   Pay special mind to the character and line spacing  Although most browsers set these to readable numbers by default  your stylesheet may overwrite the defaults and make your text difficult to read   Similarly  the line height between text within the same paragraph should be enough to make reading comfortable  but not so much that it s easily confused with the spacing between paragraphs   Remove distractions  Although many sites still use sidebars for things like advertisements or related content  much of the web has moved to long form page design within a single column   This is in part for aesthetic reasons  it looks cleaner and simpler for your reader   but also because of its impact on engagement and conversion   Videofruit studied this and found that simplifying their page to one column increased their conversions by 26    This is likely the case because readers are able to focus on each element sequentially  rather than having their attention torn between the body of your content and the offers that float alongside it   It s impossible to say for certain whether you should have a sidebar next to your content there are exceptions to every rule  But  as a general principle  you want to reduce the distractions as much as possible  Ideally  a reader half way through an article should see nothing but the text they re currently reading   Fewer distractions means more engagement and higher value creation   Writing and structure  The physical form of your lines and paragraphs also play a big role in engaging your reader   This goes beyond the elements of writing style or proper grammar  and instead involves the pace and cadence of your writing  how the words fall  and where they direct a reader s attention  Each of these plays an important role in how readers consume your content   Related  Typography tips for a more comfortable read  Write with intention  It may seem like having 2 paragraphs  each comprising 5 sentences  is no different from having the same content broken into 5  2 sentence paragraphs  But this is untrue   Variations in length and density gives our eyes a place to  latch  into the content  This means that the literal form or pace and cadence of your writing matters a lot   Think of this like a  hook    Your eyes just naturally fell on that previous sentence because it was shorter than both this paragraph that you re reading now and the one before it  This means that you have the ability to control where your reader enters your content based on how you use paragraphs  line breaks  and blocks within your writing   This works because as any designer will tell you we are naturally drawn to whitespace  or the absence of stuff  So a single  short sentence stands out amid a sea of words   Vary between short  simple sentences and more complex  explanatory paragraphs to give your reader to most chances to enter your writing  engage with what it s saying  and not get bored half way through huge blocks of text   Use short lines to make fine points or distinctions   Use subheadings  Make generous use of subheadings to break apart your writing further  giving the reader a sense of place within your content   This works for much the same reason that we often tend to read books up until the end of a particular chapter  Users like to have clear distinctions between sections and use subheadings as markers   It also creates a  hook  where readers will naturally enter into reading while skimming   Refer back to the F pattern heatmap above  Each subheading serves as the top of a new  F   But  if the  F s come too frequently  they begin to blur together and just look like big blocks of heading text rather than individual sections   Break up your text  Skimming is an essential part of consuming content on the web   There s so much stuff to read  so we rarely have time to pour over every word of an article   As content creators  we shouldn t attempt to fight this tendency it s not our job to force visitors to change their reading habits  Rather  embrace this reality and create content that takes this into account  creating visual breaks in the text and a visually engaging presentation   Related  Copywriting principles that will make new users love you  Beyond just using subheadings to create clear divisions within your content  you can also use other visual elements to break up your words and keep readers engaged as they scroll through your content   There are a number of ways you can break up your text   Lists  ordered or unordered  Photographs Charts  graphs  or other visuals Chapter or section breaks Blockquotes Call outs Calls to action  We can see in this example  from the Buffer blog  how the text is broken up frequently to give the reader a way to skim through the article and understand its flow and structure without necessarily having to reach every word   As a reader  if I get bored with the words  I can jump to the next heading  list  or image to give me a clue about what was written or what s coming up next   A study from Buzzsumo found that articles with one image for every 75 to 100 words get the most shares   That may be a bit much for most articles  but it gives you an idea of how important visuals are   As a general rule  you may want to shoot for for images every 200 400 words  This may make your content seem a bit choppy  but it offers more points for your reader to engage visually and pick up reading what you ve written   Adding value through design  So far  we ve talked about the sorts of nuts and bolts that go into making any content look and feel pretty good   But design can do much more than that   Well executed design can transform content into a resource  This may seem like a fine distinction  But  with so much content being created every day  it s important for you to communicate value to your reader immediately  Design helps you make that point   Content that exists as a designed experience feels less like  just a blog post  and more like something special and important   Consider a magazine  If all of the articles were simply printed end to end in huge blocks of text  it would be boring and unengaging  Even with all of the previous tips in place  few people would find it valuable or seek it out as a resource   Although the content itself might be just as interesting  it would be less usable   It would feel less valuable   Instead  magazine publishers meticulously design each page and the flow of the entire book to create something that s both useful and interesting  You can apply this same kind of design to your content to add value above and beyond the content itself   This kind of design serves both an aesthetic purpose  it looks better  which makes it seem more interesting to the reader  and it s also practical for providing hierarchy and organization to the words and information you want to convey   Provide organization and navigational structure  At its most basic  you can use design as a wayfinding mechanism for your readers  Specifically if you ve created a resource that has a lot of depth or covers a broad range of topics  Design makes it functionally more usable and also makes it feel deeper and richer   In this example  we see how HelpScout has neatly cataloged and categorized a massive collection of curated quotes   If this were just a simple list of quotes in a regular blog post format  it would be boring  But because it s given design and structure  it feels hefty  It feels like a valuable resource   Similarly  Vero has created one of the most comprehensive guides to email marketing around  And they use a unique  visual table of contents to make it stand out   The point here is that most companies would be happy to just write a really long blog post and slap it on a normal page  But  if you want to create exceptional resources  you need to consider the impact of design and organization of the information   Make content more usable  Additionally  design can be used as a way to organize content into sections that makes it more usable on the whole   Subheadings and other may provide some form of separation  but nothing grabs a skimming reader s attention like a change in color  design  or flow  This kind of a designed experience gives the reader the ability to skim your content for important information and then instantly jump into reading when they find what they re looking for   Affordable Colleges Online has made a habit of creating this kind of designed resource  They re not packed with information  they re also hugely usable   Give readers a sense of place and context  Design is  in large part  about providing relevant information to the user   Moz s Beginner s Guide to Search Engine Optimization is a perfect example of the value added through design  The guide is absolutely massive and tackles a huge number of interconnected topics related to search engine optimization  it turns out  there s a lot to know about SEO    But the clear navigational structure and visual queues keep you engaged and in context as a reader  helping you traverse the information and make sense about how the concepts are linked together   We can learn a lot just from looking at some of these companies that have invested time and energy into creating truly remarkable pieces of content for the rest of us to consume   Layout and design can t compensate for bad content   Creating something great starts with great content  There s no dressing it up   But good design can help you transform an otherwise good article into an epic resource something monumental and enduring   This kind of content creates more value for our readers  which means that it creates more value for your business  It s more engaging and captivating  which means that your audience is more likely to take whatever action you want them to after reading it   Design is a critical element for content  and we can t ignore its importance   Let s invest in crafting more usable  useful  and engaging content through better design   You ll love these posts about content,"[1304 209 113 853 229 783 924 1228 309 1356 1047]"
