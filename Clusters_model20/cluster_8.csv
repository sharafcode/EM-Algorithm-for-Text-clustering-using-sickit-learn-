30,training-dataset/business/406.txt,business,The One Secret to a Successful Startup  Focus  Focus  FocusLaunching a tech startup is an exciting venture for anyone  as such an endeavor is inherently risky  yet is not without its potential for prosperity  However  many founders too often get caught up in the thrill of building a new  possibly game changing product that they lose sight of their main goal and spread themselves too thin  leading their once promising company to ruin  In short  creating an offering that solves multiple problems is an admirable yet misguided mission  especially for beginning entrepreneurs   Focus  therefore  is a lesson that not only every founder needs to learn  but one that needs to be learned as soon as possible   Don t believe us  Just ask Tim Hyer  a Graduate of the Silicon Valley Founder Institute  and his company  Getable  a rental concierge for construction equipment  The company first started out as Rentcycle  a service where renters could find virtually any product they needed  However  despite some initial success  Hyer and his team made the smart move of targeting only one industry  Several years later and over  10 million in funding raised so far  the company hasn t looked back   Hyer was recently profiled on Business News Daily in the article   Behind the Business Plan  Getable   by Adam C  Uzialko  in which he discussed the history and development of Getable  offering useful insights that every budding founder should keep in mind  However  one of the most valuable bits of advice that Hyer gave was to remain focused on the task at hand and to practice restraint when exploring the possibilities of their product   By nature  a startup is extremely resource constrained  The last thing it needs is to be spread even thinner than it already is  When working on a brand new problem that no one has attempted to solve before  the possibilities are limitless   as are the distractions    Apply Focus to Company Strategies  Hyer isn t alone in this belief   Aabaco Small Business article   Focus  The Most Important Quality Your Startup Needs   Ty Morse extols the virtues of focus in the chaotic environment that results in the early days of launching a startup   Too quickly you ll take on too many things  You ll have differentiated into too many products  options  and services  in an effort to please anyone who shows even a hint of interest in your company    To stay on track  Morse recommends that founders should do the following   Choose one business model  There is no one size fits all business model that applies to every startup  so budding founders should take the time to conduct extensive research into which model they should adopt for their company before launch  And once of you ve settled on the best model for your company  stick with it  as changing models while your startup is already up and running will only hinder your success   Pick one problem your company solves and stay with it  It s tempting to continuously add more and more fancy features to your product  but until you ve completely solved one problem  none of those extra bells and whistles are going to impress your customers   Fire your bad employees  This may be one of the hardest challenges to overcome in the early days of a startup  especially when recruiting team members that are both affordable and qualified can be daunting  However  if an employee isn t furthering the progress of your company  it s time to consider the ROI of this person and thinking about letting them go  Keeping bad employees on board will only create additional problems down the road   Apply Focus to Daily Tasks  Focus isn t just something that should be implemented in your company s overall strategy  but something that should be applied to your daily routine  as well  In the Tech co article   7 Habits of Successful Startup Founders   by Meagan French  Twitter founder and CEO of multiple startups Jack Dorsey cites focus as the primary cause of his productivity  refusing to let the lure of multitasking inform his day to day work schedule   In fact  Dorsey goes so far as to assign himself  theme days   which allows him to devote 100  of his energy to a different theme on each day  Here s what he has to say on the matter   On Monday  at both companies  I focus on management and running the company  Tuesday is focused on product  Wednesday is focused on marketing and communications and growth  Thursday is focused on developers and partnerships      Living in the digital age means that most people want results sooner and sooner  which has led to the belief that multitasking is the way to go  However  in a study conducted by the American Psychological Association  researchers have concluded that carrying out more than one task at a time  especially more than one complex task  takes seriously hinders productivity and efficiency  So next time you feel the urge to say  yes  to more matters that may require your attention  make sure that your task is completed before moving to the next one   Final Thoughts  If you still think that taking on more and more responsibility as an entrepreneur will ensure the success of your company  divert your attention to the words of Paul Graham  cofounder of Y Combinator  which has graduated over 630 startups  including Dropbox  Airbnb  and Stripe  Put simply   The most important thing for startups to do is to focus  because there are so many things you could be doing  One of them is the most important  You should be doing that  And not any of the others     Young pretty businesswoman juggling with white balls image by Shutterstock,"[30 122 377 147 626 603 133 937 619 1172 1258]"

innovation  From the North America to Africa  from Europe to Australia  from South America to Asia  more and more cities are challenging Silicon Valley s reputation as a global startup hub   However  every city that gives way to the rise of local companies requires certain conditions that are conducive to entrepreneurial activity  And  more often than not  it takes certain people to take the lead in their city and bring network together to encourage innovation and growth   The Founder Institute can help you build a startup ecosystem in your city  Click here to find out how   If you want to become an entrepreneurial leader and build a startup ecosystem in your city  this blog post has everything you need to get started   Why Should You Build a Startup Ecosystem in Your City   It Improves the Local Economy  Don t sit around waiting for major conglomerates and tech companies to move to your city and bring jobs  Believe it or not  it is the small businesses  and not large corporations  that form the backbone of most economies and provide the most jobs  Remember  every giant company started off as a small business  and considering how much easier it is to launch a startup than in previous years  a handful of small yet ambitious companies can do more to invigorate the local economy than  say  Facebook can do by setting up an office in your area   It Strengthens the Network  Nothing brings professionals closer than working together to launch a company  By facilitating the exchange of ideas  skills  and experience  you are planting the seeds for a thriving  interconnected network of talented individuals who are working to solve a problem  The strongest startup ecosystems only grow when the people of an economy work together  rather than against one another  to succeed  While a little rivalry can be beneficial for businesses  too much competition will only fracture and divide the community  which will lead to economic stagnation  In short  if everyone helps each other with their companies  everyone wins   It was a life changing experience to nurture the next generation of entrepreneurs in my city  It was a great way to find opportunities for investment in local innovative ideas as well     Sergio Escobar  Director  Montreal Founder Institute   What Does it Take to Become a Startup Ecosystem Leader in Your City   In the Forbes article   A Simple Way To Become A Better Startup Mentor   Founder Institute co founder and CEO Adeo Ressi outlines some of the most important qualities of startup leaders  Below are a couple of the biggest takeaways   You Have to be Brutally Honest  If you want to help aspiring entrepreneurs launch startups  you cannot hold back when giving them feedback  Whether you are providing advice on someone else s idea  team  product  revenue model  customer research  or anything else  it is important to be as honest and straightforward as possible  Pointing out the flaws of a company when they are still at an early stage will help founders fix and prevent problems in the future  Also  because every company will get negative feedback at some point during its lifespan   either from mentors  investors  or customers   subjecting early stage startups to harsh feedback from the beginning will only prepare them for the challenges ahead   You Also Have to be Empathetic  As important as it is to be brutally honest from the onset  it is just as important not to get carried away with your criticisms and to temper your blunt feedback with encouragement and understanding  Instead of only pointing out the weaknesses of the founders you are mentoring  work together with them to find solutions  to strengthen their ideas  to build a better product  etc  Recall a time from your life in which someone was there to support you through a tough time  and use that experience to help you help others   How Do You Turn Your City into a Startup Ecosystem   The Boulder Thesis  When Brad Feld helped found Techstars in 2006 in Boulder  Colorado  he developed a blueprint for building startup communities called the Boulder Thesis  This is a great primer for those looking to launch a startup in their city as it clearly lays out a defined vision for a sustainable entrepreneurial community  Below are the core concepts   Entrepreneurs must lead the startup community  Those who launch companies must also devote their time and efforts to help others launch companies  The leaders must have a long term commitment  Entrepreneurship isn t for people who only like to dabble in different industries until they find something like  The startup community must be inclusive of anyone who wants to participate in it  The more people you have in the community  the more ideas  the more talent  and the more potential for success you have  The startup community must have continual activities that engage the entire entrepreneurial stack  Hackathons  Startup Weekends  and other events are necessary to keep the network alive and engaged   Check out the video below for more information on the Boulder Thesis   Map the Local Market  Before you set out to establish your region as an active entrepreneurial hub  you first must list out what it has that can benefit aspiring entrepreneurs  Startup resources may include coworking spaces  venues for networking events  preexisting professional networks and groups  accelerators and incubators  educational institutions specializing in business and entrepreneurship  government organizations  and many others  If you need help organizing your findings  or to see if there is already a map of your city s resources  check out the Startup Ecosystem Canvas   a free tool from the Founder Institute to map your community and make it more accessible to newcomers   Gather the Network  If you re planning on becoming a startup leader in your city  it should go without saying that you ve already accumulated a considerable network of industry professionals and experts  Your next step  then  should be to bring them together and encourage them to do the same with their respective networks  Meetup com is a great way to organize tech and business events in your city  as well as to network with other likeminded individuals in industry related groups   Also  the Founder Institute hosts over 1 000 free local startup events around the world each year  where local startup experts share their lessons learned and provide feedback on startup ideas  These events are all free and open to the public  with names like  Startup Pitch Bootcamp    Startup Founder 101   and more  The goal of these events is to create a low pressure  open environment where people share ideas  make connections  learn about the opportunities to launch a company in their city  and become inspired   Spread the Knowledge  Another great way to build a startup ecosystem in your city is to start mentoring other early stage founders and their companies  This has several benefits  First  by serving as a mentor to others  you are establishing yourself as an entrepreneurial expert and boosting your credibility  which will open numerous opportunities for you as you create a growing startup network  Second  helping other aspiring entrepreneurs means you are leading by example  which means you will be inspiring other experts lend their skills and knowledge to help other aspiring entrepreneurs  and so on and so forth  Third  by supporting local startups and guiding them to success  you will cement your city s reputation as a startup friendly region   Work with Your Government  Governments around the world are slowly starting to realize that increased entrepreneurial activity has a favorable effect on the economy  which means that more local government institutions developing ways to help startups get off the ground  Some resources that local governments provide may include coworking and office space  tax credits for investors  financial initiatives to fund companies  tax incentives for companies that exceed environmental standards  and training programs for entrepreneurs  among many others  Connect with the Chamber of Commerce in your city to see what they have to offer small businesses that are just starting up  Or  even better  get involved in your city s politics by attending council meetings to make your case for why startups can be beneficial to the city    Community

122,training-dataset/business/1186.txt,business,Creating an Elevator Pitch that Attracts Investors  Customers  and MoreA startup needs plenty of steady capital in order to survive and  ultimately  to thrive  Whether it s in the form of investor funding or a strong customer base  every company relies on the financial resources of others to grow   But how can founders convince other of the viablility of their offering in a compelling way   Luckily  this blog post dives deep into how entrepreneurs can fashion their pitch in a way that will attract the attention of anyone   including investors  customers  co founders  and more   featuring insights from Carter Laren  co founder and Managing Partner at Gateway Incubator   Don t Pivot  Persevere  For too many founders  ideas are a dime a dozen  Founders are constantly coming up with ideas  whether it s in the shower  on the drive to work  while having dinner with the family  or in any other everyday situation  Even if they re already running a company  founders are almost always coming up with ideas about other products to build   However  while it s important to always have new ideas  to always be innovating  founders must realize that when they set out to launch a startup  they are basically working on their life s work  Just because you ve gotten bored with your current venture doesn t mean that you should give it up and begin work on something else   Before you begin working on a new idea  you first need to evaluate why you ve chosen that particular idea to work on  Don t set out to launch a company if you re reasons align with any of these   You want to be the boss  Even top CEOs have to answer to others  whether it s a board of directors  advisors  employees  customers  etc   You think launching a company will be fun  Launching a company is incredibly hard  stressful  and time consuming   You want to get rich quick  During the first few months  or even years  of launching a startup  you and your company will be scrambling to cover basic costs   In short  there are much better  lucrative  and less stressful career paths to consider before just launching a startup   However  if none of the above reasons factor into why you want to start a company  then you may have what it takes to be an entrepreneur  If you want to start a company because you think you can make a positive impact on the world and you are able to stick to that reason even when things are looking bad for your company  your experience will be more rewarding and fulfilling   Important Tips to Keep in Mind Before You Pitch Your Startup  When you are first startup up  it s not just investors you re going to have to pitch  You re going to have to pitch your company to potential co founders and team members  prospective customers  mentors and advisors  and many others   And that s why it s so important to have a definitive reason for why you re launching a startup  That reason is how you can convince co founders to help bring your idea to life  convince team members to work for almost no money  and convince other companies to partner with you   Also  there is belief that s prevalent throughout the startup world  and especially in Silicon Valley  that pitching is all about talking at your audience and that  once done  they will be convinced of your idea  This is wrong  For early stage founders  pitching should be more of a conversation  one that engages their audience and encourages them to ask questions about the idea   Basically  instead of merely dumping long sentences about your idea and market size on your audience  approach them in a way you would approach a friendly acquaintance  Start by introducing yourself and your background and ask them about themselves  then gracefully segue into your idea   Stop Using Superlatives in Your Startup Pitch  Investors hate to be told conclusions  Investors hate to be told what to think  And they hate to be told how great your company is  When pitching to investors  it s important to only give them the facts of your company and to let them determine if your company is worth investing in   And the best way to do this is stop using superlatives in your startup pitch  If you don t know what a superlative is  Oxford Dictionaries defines it as  an exaggerated or hyperbolical expression of praise   This means that you should stop using words like  revolutionary    game changing    disruptive   and others to describe your company  Not only are these types of words overused in the startup world  but using them makes you sound presumptuous   Instead of using exaggerated words and phrases to describe your company  focus on how your offering solves a widespread market  why you re most qualified to lead this company  and any traction that your company has achieved since launching   Remember  facts will always be more effective than opinions   Should You Tailor Your Startup Pitch for Different Audiences   Whenever you re starting a new company  whether it s your first or one or not  it s important to keep the  why  of your startup  the reason you re launching this company  the same  When you re meeting with vendors  investors  potential co founders  first team members  or new customers  your intentions and motivations need to remain static  If your passion for launching a startup changes with every person you meet  you will only put your reputation at risk and establish yourself as disingenuous   In short  take the time to clearly establish your  why  for launching your startup and be sure to infuse it into the beginning of every version of your startup pitch   Now  for the later portions of your startup pitch  you should definitely create a variety of talking points tailored for specific audiences  Keep in mind that as you describe what your company is and what it does  that you re not talking  at  your audience so much as you re talking  to  them  For example  the details that are important for investors to know may not be necessary for recruiting co founders  and the pitch you give to co founders should be different from the pitch your give to vendors  and so on   Basically  it s necessary to create numerous types of pitches for your company  as each should have its own distinct purpose   How Do You Talk to Investors   Even if you re an experienced entrepreneur or businessperson  or you have a billion dollar idea on your hands  you still have to put in the work to perfect the overall presentation of your startup pitch   For example  if you re meeting investors at an event  conference  or mixer  it s essential to present your idea in a conversational tone  For beginning founders  it s tempting to cram your life story and everything that led up to the conception of your startup into one sentence  But blasting a potential investor with a barrage of information is a terrible way to generate interest in what you have to say  Focus on being casual  concise  and friendly  as this will keep investors  well  invested in your idea   Another tip to keep in mind is that when you giving your startup pitch  investors are evaluating you just much as  if not more than  they re evaluating your idea  Take brief pauses in between sentences to give them an opportunity to offer feedback  And remember  whatever you do  DO NOT get defensive when they question the viability of your idea  as investors are also gauguing you on how open you are to new ideas and how well you collaborate   How Do You Find Your Startup s Secret Sauce   In the rush of launching a new startup  it s easy for founders to develop the belief that their idea can solve a widespread problem and change the world in the process  This is wrong  Just because you perceive something to be a problem or an inefficiency  it does not mean that it is  Countless entrepreneurs have created  solutions  to what they thought were problems  only to have the product fail in a short amount of time  The problem is that they were solving the wrong problem or that they set out to solve something that wasn t a problem to begin with  Like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound  building a solution for a nonexistent problem is utterly pointless   The best way to overcome this feeling  and also to discover what sets your offering above others  is to conduct massive amounts of research into the problem you want to solve  Meet with the people who would actually used your product and take extensive notes on their routines and lifestyles to really determine what problems need to be solved  During this process  you may discover that what you thought was a problem isn t a problem for your customers   If you want even more tips on perfecting your startup pitch  check out the resources below   Did you know that

the world  But before that happens  a startup has to be properly set up to expand outside of its hometown   The path to building a global business is a long and treacherous one  but it is possible to traverse  However  as to be expected in the startup world  rushing into a project without the proper planning is a surefire way to fail   Luckily  we at the Founder Institute have gathered some of the best advice from some of the world s top startup experts to help you set up your company for global expansion   The Founder Institute can help you launch a global startup  Click here to join a program in your city today   Plan Your Local Expansion  Make Globalization Part of Your Company from the Beginning  To successfully build a global company  you first need to establish the foundation on which you will build  In the first installment of John O Farrell s  Building the Global Startup  series  he lays out the key principles for an effective international launch  Below are some of the most important points to consider as you begin to plan your expansion   Your startup needs to have a mission statement that conveys your expansiveness from the beginning  as this will establish a culture of globalization within the company itself and permeate many of your most important business decisions  Also  having an all encompassing mission statement for your company will also impact your marketing and how you are perceived by the world at large  Below are some mission statements from some of the world s biggest companies   Google   To organize the world s information and make it universally accessible and useful      Nike   To bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world      Facebook   To give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected    Make the effort to find and recruit employees with international experience  especially for senior and management positions  In fact  it might even be useful to make internationalization and localization experience a requirement for these roles to bring in valuable expertise   Be sure that your intellectual property  IP  is protected when and if your company goes global  Start by registering trademarks and domain names in the top 10 20 countries and regions you expect to expand to   Define Your Global Expansion Strategy  Once you ve taken the initial steps towards preparing your startup for global expansion  you must then define your strategy for international growth  These five questions  from  Building the Global Startup Part 2  Get Yourself a Strategy   should help you lay the groundwork for a solid plan   What is our goal  Your goal can be qualitative  like  Our company will be the top selling mobile game in the U S  and Europe by 2020   or quantitative  like  Our company will generate 45  of our revenue from outside of Asia by 2019   Whichever it is  make sure it s ambitious  specific  and measureable  What countries will we focus on  Pick countries that will generate the most return with the smallest investment  For example  once you ve established your company in your native country  expand next to countries that have the same language and similar markets  Create a quantitative spreadsheet that rank the world s countries by the criteria that best suit your needs  What product s  will we launch  Unless you have a product that s like Twitter that works exactly the same regardless of region  your product or suite of products are going to require customization depending on where you plan to launch next  Once you ve picked the region you re going to expand to  ensure that your product caters to that specific market  How will we go to market  Each country you expand to will come with its own set of challenges and requirements  For example  if you are a mobile company  then partnering with a mobile operator is your best choice  If your company provides enterprise software  you may need to hire a direct sales force  What s our operating model  Your operating model should be based on the functions you plan on managing centrally  and which you plan on managing locally  The amount of autonomy you give to local offices will be determined by your company s business and revenue models  your products  size  and marketing strategies  so don t forget to give your operating model extra attention   Establish Your Local Presence  Once you have a clear plan for expanding your startup to other countries  it s time to put that plan into action and settle into your new region  In The Next Web article   How to Take Your Startup Global on a Shoestring Budget   Alec Lynch offers some useful tips to founders who are ready to launch into a new country  Here are several considerations to keep in mind as you establish your presence   Localize Your Startup   Ensure that your company can properly do business and legitimize itself by securing a local domain name and a local phone number  and make sure that your company can accept the local currency  Once these tasks are finished  then you can begin the process of localizing the smaller aspects of your company  like sample clients and testimonials for local marketing copy  Use Google to Grow Your Startup Locally   Because advertising online is the best way to market your company  you should employ Google for your marketing needs  including validating market demand and getting your first sales  Establish Partnerships with Other Local Companies   Before launching your product in a new region  conduct extensive research into the local market to find preexisting large companies in similar industries that you may be able to partner with  You might even be able to leverage these types of partnerships to launch into even more countries  Acquire Other Local Companies   This route isn t for everyone  as this is an expensive way to take a company global and requires considerable capital  However  if your company can afford to go down this path  acquiring a company in a desirable region is an effective way to expand into a new country  Employ Content to Grow Your Audience   As stated before  online marketing is currently the most popular and effective way to build a brand s audience  Create customized content that caters specifically to your new international audience  For example  viral content  infographics  and in depth industry insights are great at attracting audiences and establishing your startup s presence  Use Thought Leadership to Establish Credibility   For those not familiar with thought leadership  it is a type of content marketing that s based on the expertise  experience  and mission of your company or community  Thought leadership is a great way to promote your company while engaging with your audience in a more personal  meaningful way that establishes trust  Build Your Startup s Brand   One of the hardest aspects of launching your company in a new country is building your brand  While many of the previous tactics will help build your company s brand  the best method is a strong local PR push  Wait for the right time to launch in a new country by tying your launch to a current  local event  one in which your company s services may be most useful   Grow Your Company  Once your company is in a new country  it s time to begin capitalizing on your progress and take your company to the next stage of advancement  David Becker  the co founder of Zkipster  wrote about his personal experience of expanding his company in The Guardian article   How to Take Your Startup Global Without Going Bust   Below are some of Becker s insights on how to make the most of your company s expansion and ensure that your company is on track to succeed   Expand your company  one country at a time   Launching in any new country will come at considerable costs  depending on where you expand  so it s important to firmly establish your company in one country before moving to the next instead of expanding to multiple global locations at the same time  Take care when deciding where to launch next and exhaustively plan each launch   Remember  operational expenses  including office rent and legal fees  can be extremely high  especially in major metropolitan cities  However  because these regions tend to be the most desirable and lucrative for expanding your business  high costs of living and working shouldn t deter you  When first physically operating in a new country  take advantage of local coffee shops and coworking spaces to cut costs   Grow your local presence by establishing local offices   Even if your company s offering isn t physical  it s easy to assume that just because your product is cloud based or mobile that you don t need to have a physical presence in a new country  Yes  an app can be downloaded anywhere that has internet access  but without a strong local presence  the chances of someone stumbling across your app will be left entirely to chance rather than referrals   It has been proven time and time again that companies that establish local offices experience exponential growth in international regions  Once your company has developed traction in a new country  it s essential that you set up a local office to continue your company s growth   Make corporate culture a priority   As your startup continues to grow internationally  it s important that you ensure that all of members of your local teams share the same values that your company was originally based on  Even if your company s workforce is still relatively small  if your reach expands across multiple countries  ensuring that all employees have access to the information they need should be a top priority   Your founding team should also set aside some time to physically meet with local teams  prospects  clients  and thought leaders as regularly as possible  Remember  it s an illusion to think that you can manage and grow a company simply through email and phone calls        Female construction worker in room and

147,training-dataset/business/1234.txt,business,Unconventional Methods for Building a Startup To live a creative life  we must lose our fear of being wrong     Joseph Chilton Pearce  Creativity is the heart of entrepreneurship  The best companies were founded by people who saw a problem to be fixed  a gap to be filled  a demand to be met  But a creative solution is only as successful as its execution  The best  most lasting  and most impactful companies not only came from an ingenious idea  but from people who looked at the process of building a company and asked themselves   How can I do this differently    Launching a startup is inherently risky  so if you plan on venturing into the world of entrepreneurship  why not take the opportunity to risk it all on trying something different  In this blog post  we ve gathered some of the most unusual  unorthodox  and unexpected methods of launching a startup from some of the top experts in the field   Recruit Your Team  No one can run a company by themselves  so picking your cofounders and first employees should not be taken lightly  because the people you bring on board to help you will have a lasting impact on the future of your company  Fortunately  there are a few creative methods you can utilize to help you find the right people for your startup team   Co founders  In the Inc article   50 Ways to Find Co founders   Bill Murphy Jr  lists out a plethora of ways  both conventional and unconventional  that entrepreneurs can connect with potential co founders  Here are just a few of the more unexpected approaches   Network with people over drinks coffee  This is an easy choice  especially for those who are extroverted  and it happens more often than you think  In fact  Dean Wright of Voytech Products  which makes Snack Spout  claims he became acquainted with his eventual co founders when he overheard them talking in his local Starbucks about his area of expertise  consumer products   Connect with people you went to school with  Take the time to meet up with your old school chums  whether you met in college  high school  or even elementary school  And don t even think about skipping school reunions  Some people get started early  Again  cofounders who started as classmates is not uncommon  For example  Zach Schau and his co founders at Pure Fix Cycles met when they were just little kids   Team up with siblings  former co workers  and spouses  Potential cofounders may be closer than you think  MUCH closer  For example  twin brothers Sam and Andy Prochazka started Novosbed  a memory foam mattress company  before they recruited their sister  Helenka   Volunteering  Besides getting the satisfaction of giving back to your community  volunteering is also a great way to meet likeminded tech geeks  Just ask co founders Michael Marshall and Paola Moya  who met when Marshal volunteered tobe an advisor for their shared alma mater s architecture program  which led to them forming Marshall Moya Design in Washington   What s worse than starting a business without a co founder  Try starting it with the wrong co founder    Bill Murphy Jr   Employees  Our previous blog posts   The Ultimate Guide to Hiring Your First Employees   features some expert advice from Dan Arkind  Founder and CEO of JobScore  on how to attract and recruit your company s first employees   Add excitement to your job listing  When posting a job description for a startup  too many founders rely on a typical formula  a formula that  unfortunately  does little to attract top talent  Take the time to inject passion  hope  and excitement into your job description  and structure it in the form of a story   Ask for advice  While it may appear that you are only asking for help with your startup  what

before mass producing and making sales  there are a few  more obscure tactics that you can utilize when creating working version of your offering   Ditch the  Coming Soon  page  Amir Khella s blog post   How I launched a profitable product in 3 hours   covers considerable ground when explaining the process of building a successful offering  and is most surprising when it recommends bucking the traditional  Coming Soon  page so prevalent in conventional startup business models  However  that blog post does have a point  as  Coming Soon  pages are getting more and more gimmicky  Instead  replace it with a page that talks about your company s story  updates  and mission  This is a great way to get potential customers interested in your company as opposed to scaring them off by telling them that your product is  coming soon   whenever that is   Instead of a coming soon page  start a conversation  talk about your story  share your process and findings  and provide value even before

MVPs Right    Alex Kholti goes over variety of strategies for creating minimum viable products cheaply  quickly  and of course  unconventionally  Below are a couple of standouts from his article   The  Wizard of Oz  MVP  If your MVP is still under construction  there s no reason that all of your potential customers should think that you are falling behind on getting your product out there  Create a version of your offering that looks functional  but is actually operated by you behind the scenes  giving the appearance of automation  Even if you aren t quite ready to launch  at least this will serve as a proof of concept to your target audience and will buy you time while create the finished version   The  Piecemeal  MVP  Instead of a massive amount of time  money  and effort into building

blog post   5 Early Wins That Got Our SaaS Startup 1 000 Beta Users   one of which is the viral sign up form  a technique follows from the preceding example  Employ a viral signup flow that leverages one user or subscriber to maximize the return   For example  Groove required users to invite three friends in order to get access to their beta  Even though the number of initial subscribers  non invitees  dropped when they did this  Groove attracted nearly 30  more subscribers per day after invitees responded to their friends  posts on social media  Basically  instead of thinking about how to

what your company does is your best bet   Unique business cards  For many people  business cards are considered outdated  boring  and excessively corporate  But if your business card is unique  others

important part of building a sustaining business  but can be difficult to acquire  especially if you re a first time entrepreneur  However  we ve gathered some of the more outre means of raising money for a startup from the Business News Daily article   14 Creative Financing Methods for Startups   by Nicole Fallon Taylor   Online Lending  In recent years  more and more entrepreneurs have relied on online lending services  including OnDeck and Kabbage  as opposed to more conventional business loans  The reason for this is simple  while standard business loan applications can take weeks or months to process  whereas online lenders online require up to an hour to complete and a few days to finalize and transfer funds   Product Presales  Another overlooked yet incredibly effective means of raising money for a startup is selling your products before you ve officially launched  For example  entrepreneur Priska Diaz was able to raise  50 000 for her compan  Bittylab  with the presale of her Bare air free baby bottles  which was able to help her cover the cost of inventory  She also used this as an opportunity to learn more about her website s customers while opening doors in the retail industry   Side Business  It may seem silly to start a business in order to  well  start another business  However  the idea isn t as ridiculous as you may think  One way to do this is start a small business at first  one that you can easily manage in your spare time to raise some money specifically to help you launch your dream company  For example  Alex Genadinik used the money he made from tours he organized on ComeHike com to launch Problemio com  which builds mobile apps for planning and starting a business   Win a contest or hackathon  Sometimes  businesses can benefit from a bit of luck  That was the case for Roberto Torres and Luis Montanez  who funded a portion of their startup costs for their apparel company  Black   Denim  with winnings from a business plan competition  Find startup   business   or tech related contests to participate in  Or  if you have any other talents or hobbies that aren t related to your company  find other outside contests to test your skills AND make some money for your startup   While the plethora of lending options may make it easier than ever to get started  responsible business owners should ask themselves how much financial assistance they really need     Nicole Fallon Taylor  However  if none of these more  outside  means of financing your company appeal to you  check out our resources below for the conventional methods of startup funding   Final Thoughts  As you venture out into the world of entrepreneurship  keep in mind that the road will be filled with obstacles and detours  You will encounter challenges that will force you to rethink  redo  or completely toss out your original plan  And it is in these circumstances that you must exercise your creativity and think outside of the box to conjure up a solution  regardless of how whimsical or outrageous it may be  You never know   your whacky answer to a problem may pave a path for others to follow  so don t ever be afraid to put your artistic side to the forefront when things get dark    Creativity is intelligence having fun     Albert Einstein   Businesswoman standing with back drawing business ideas on wall image by

265,training-dataset/business/702.txt,business,Perfect Your Elevator Pitch with the Pyramid Pitching TechniqueOne of the most important skills aspiring entrepreneurs need to have is properly pitching their company  If you want to impress investors  attract customers  and recruit co founders and team members  being able to describe what your startup does quickly and efficiently is absolutely necessary  Luckily  startup expert Dan Shapiro is here to provide you with a simple yet effective method of pitching your company   Dan Shapiro is a Seattle startup veteran who has founded and led four successful startups  He is currently the founder and CEO of 3D laser printing company Glowforge  He is a mentor at the Seattle Founder Institute   The blog post  Pyramid Pitching  originally appeared on Dan s blog  An excerpt has been republished below with permission   Everyone knows of the mythical elevator pitch  You find yourself in an elevator  rocketing towards the penthouse suite of a downtown office edifice  when you realize that the person standing next to you is a powerful and influential investor  She asks what you do  and you calmly deliver your pitch  Just a sentence or two  properly chosen  The doors open  the conversation continues  the IPO is near at hand   I m here to tell you that the elevator is real  While you may not be trapped in a small ascending room  the potent entrepreneur s life is full of inflection moments  brief opportunities to shift the destiny of your company  And a proper pitch is essential to take advantage of them  But contrary to what you might have heard  the solution isn t the 60 second elevator pitch  In fact  the elevator pitch is only a simple  basic example of a much more powerful tool  the Pyramid Pitch   Pyramid Pitching  The Pyramid Pitch is based off of a simple and fundamental principle  startups are dictated by randomness and chaos  Sometimes this is obvious  as in the elevator case  Other times the situation appears controlled  for example when you have 5 minutes allocated to speak at a pitch event  But minds wander  distractions beckon  bladders fill  if you don t grab your audience immediately  you may never get them back   The Pyramid Pitch draws its name from Maslow s famous hierarchy  Maslow postulated that humans had many  needs   but some were more fundamental than others  Until fundamental needs like food  water  and excretion were met  people would not be able to strive to achieve needs that were higher in the pyramid  like morality  spontaneity  and self actualization  Or  as I like to think of it  it s hard to attain enlightenment when you have to go to the bathroom   So the concept is simple  when you pitch  deal with the most urgent matters first  What those are will vary by company and by listener  but let me give you an example from my first startup  Ontela  Ontela was founded in 2005  as the notion of including a camera phone was just taking off  It was two years before the launch of the iPhone  and at the time  people were just starting to come around to the idea that a camera on a phone was more than a gimmick  Here was the top of my pyramid pitch  It would usually start with someone asking me what we do   Ontela makes it ridiculously easy to get pictures off of your camera phone   This is the first line of the pitch  It addresses the most urgent and pressing matter in the investor s mind at this point in the conversation   Do you do something that I find the teeniest tiniest bit interesting    Today  74  of people can t get pictures of their phone  With Ontela  you just hit the shutter button and the picture appears on your PC in less than a minute   There are now two possibilities  The first is that the conversation has been brought to an abrupt halt by something like  That sounds fascinating but I only invest in clean tech companies    Oops this is my floor   or                       The second is that they are thinking   OK  how do you do that    We license our software to wireless carriers who include the software on your phone   Again  two options  they flip the bozo bit and say sayonara  or they nod agreeably and start wondering what the actual business looks like  So you explain to them the most important thing  distribution  In this case  through the wirelesscarriers   The service is free for a month  Then  it prompts you to subscribe for  2 99 month to continue using it   If they made it this far  things are going pretty well  and they re probably wondering about how we  and by extension  if they invest  they  are going to make money   The pitch goes on from there  but the philosophy is incredibly simple   The most important stuff goes first  and If you stop at any point  they walk away with a solid idea of what you re doing   This may seem simple and obvious  but I ve seen too many people mess it up   Bad Pitches  The story pitch  They lead off with a 5 minute backstory on how they thought of the invention  how they met their cofounder  or why they care so much about this business  There are times when this is appropriate   like when you re seated next to someone at a dinner  and you know the story s good   but it s usually the wrong move  First  because you get cut off  and now they know about your college DJing business but have no clue what your new company does  Second  because they zone out hoping you ll just get to the point  Third  because if you re not a great storyteller  and it s not a great story   this will backfire terribly   The business plan pitch  They lead off with market sizing  competitors  and business case analysis  Great for your second meeting  not so good for an introduction   The feature pitch  They start rattling off a list of all the nifty things their product does  This is a great way to say to your new friend with the crossed arms and distracted smile   I may ignore strategy for tactics  but at least I m deaf to social cues    The disease is sloppy and meandering pitches  The solution is the Pyramid Pitch  Just remember  Think about your audience  Respect the random hand of fate  And happy pitching,"[265 122 1203 626 377 835 611 147 710

268,training-dataset/business/604.txt,business,2 excuses startups should never useSize doesn t matter  2 excuses startups should never use  In the world of startups  you often don t have the answers up front  There are a million unknowns which you have to figure out as you go along  and working in a startup environment often means there s a lack of process and structure  These boundless structures of early stage companies often also attract certain type of personalities  People who thrive in some level of chaos where things are less formal and unpredictable  where creativity can shine and true innovation happens   But as to everything beautiful  there s a flip side  Within this unscripted environment startups can easily fall into a dangerous mindset which manifests itself through two different phrases    We re just a small startup     and    Things are moving so fast for us    Companies use these statements as exclusions to certain behaviors  often as a way to distant themselves from  being corporate    The truth is  these phrases are used as broad stroke reasons to justify the lack of professionalism  They are simply symptoms of not working smart  intelligently or hard enough   I see this behavior way too often  and I mistakenly used both statements myself  During a time when we were scaling Wrapp we hired new people across different functions and geographies every week   I disregarded the importance of great onboarding for new hires and proactively didn t articulate  align and teach the company culture   I said to myself  things are moving so fast that we just need to get high quality people in through the door and the rest we ll figure out later    Big mistake   Lack of cultural alignment proved to be a big issue down the line  where people didn t know what it meant to be part of  team Wrapp   This was something which could have been avoided by a more proactive stance  I knew upfront about the importance of culture but I had mistakenly used speed as a justification to not invest into it   Another example is how we in the beginning of our sales efforts thought  we re just a small startup with a small team and we don t need a sales process   Months went by where we were unable to efficiently extract learnings from our sales efforts  and not until we started articulating what our ideal sales process looked like were we able to make improvements and iterations thereof   Our small size was used to rationalize why we didn t need to intelligently think through a critical business function   It s difficult to do everything in a startup and you have to prioritize  But recognize that you will only succeed if you step up your game  Whenever you hear either of these two sentences used as an explanation for anything  you need to start to worry and take action   So here s a simple 4 step plan to force yourself out of this dangerous mentality   Start small  Don t overthink nor perfect before starting to use it  Think MVP  Minimum Viable Product  for all projects  processes  tools  systems  etc  Document and measure  Putting ideas into writing is a very powerful and often underestimated way of aligning people  And collecting data about how things are going is a requirement for  3  Validate and iterate  Based upon what you learn push yourself to redefine all aspects of your company into becoming smarter  more efficient and more effective  Never settle and constantly challenge any way you re doing something  Remember  all people processes need to be redefined each time you double in team size from 5 to 10  from 10 to 20  from 20 to 40 and so on  Aim big  Whenever you lean towards excusing yourself as a startup say to yourself  We may be a startup  but we aspire to be the most professional well run company in the world  You are small and early and you identify yourself as a startup  But you want to be a successful company  Your goal is to be the best   This framework is not about becoming a boring corporate with restrictions on creativity and innovation  On the contrary creativity and innovation is  in fact  a huge part of it   You win and become better than the rest through creativity and innovation  Rock on and grow up,"[268 611 1258 710 486 626 1076 759 147 1208 569]"

problem  That s why they need an MVP  A Minimum Viable Product refers to a product with only those features  nothing more  that are needed to gauge into customer insight and find out what have to say about it   QuickMVP is the perfect tool for startups to take their business idea for a test drive before they could launch it as a full fledged product  The benefit  It saves you from wasting money on

Kickstarter  Business costs money  But  where to procure it  It s common knowledge that not everyone has enough funding to fuel their business ideas and bring them into practicality  But  that shouldn t stop ideas  which may have great potential to change world of business  from becoming a reality  Hence  the concept of fundraising or crowdfunding   Speaking of which  Kickstarter happens to be a great platform from where you can secure adequate funding to support your startup  This global community is built particularly for creative projects that revolve around designing  filmmaking  development  art  and lots more  The platform is perfect to get people from all over the world to support your idea and share it with communities that could further support it   5  Press coverage

tell your story and get you recognition  The tool  however  does not automate the process of getting media coverage  You will still have to do the majority work on your own  But  it sure does make it easier to increase your customer outreach and secure branding   6  Quality stock photography   Pexels 2 0  Part of promoting a startup is launching a website  starting a blog  and conducting all sorts of promotional campaigns  All that is obviously going to need quality photography  which can be quite expensive if you don t know where to look for it  Pexels 2 0 is the place where you can find

spend hundreds of dollars just to procure one image   7  Customer feedback and surveys   Typeform  What do your customers have to say about your product service  Customer feedback is extremely valuable because it helps you analyse whether you re headed in the right direction or whether the business strategy needs to change  But  we all know that creating surveys and getting customers to fill them out is a huge pain   Typeform is a platform where you can create surveys that are both fun and easy  It s extremely simple to use and perfect for creating engaging and visually appealing questionnaires that make sure customers have a good time submitting them   A startup is bombarded with challenges  Primarily it means getting things done within minimum time  cost  and resources  If

startup   Kay   The first startup in my life happened exactly 20 years ago  when I first came to the States  At that time I didn t know much about startups  I was just happy to get a paycheck on time  I didn t consider the risk I was taking on and  unfortunately  that startup dissolved four years later  leaving me looking for a new job while on a work permit as a single mother of three  For years after that experience  I was focused on job security and stability  In hindsight I realize coming to a new country with three small children and no support network was almost more adventurous than joining a startup   But for the first time recently I was in a position to choose my next job without feeling I needed to hurry  I realized I didn t want stability but rather I wanted more responsibilities  I wanted to make a difference in an organization and to have decision making power  Once I was able to identify the things I wanted  I was fortunate to find an job opportunity almost immediately that was a great fit   More specifically  a startup is appealing to me if its management team is understanding that everyone has their own needs in terms of work schedule and time off  That they are able to offer flexible schedules that can be tailored to my needs  It s important that this isn t something that is just said  but that I can see it demonstrated as part of the company s culture  Then I need to validate that the tech team shares my technical values  is open to discussion before making big technical decisions  and doesn t just make decisions based on team member seniority  Understanding my manager is extremely important  I ll make sure my manager trusts everyone on the team  treats them like responsible adults  and is able to step back and let people get work done without being micromanaged  Related   I look for a manager that doesn t count hours spent on work but rather evaluates the results  When my kids were small  I used to do 4 to 6 hours a day of very focused work and would produce the same amount of work as others during an 8 hour shift   Ada   When considering an early startup  there are three main questions on my mind  Do I think the team has the ability to execute as they scale  Can I peacefully coexist with everyone on the team and can they peacefully coexist with each other  Is this idea good or is it bullshit  All these questions are tough to answer  and trying to figure out the answers involves a lot of guesswork  To get a sense for the team  I try to spend a fair amount of time observing how they interact with each other  If I have multiple people interviewing me at once  how do they communicate with one another  How do the founders talk about their cofounders  I try to pay attention to little cues like that  It s super useful to spend time with the team outside of a work context to get a sense for who they all are as people  so I ll try to grab coffee  drinks  or dinner with the team in a non office setting if possible   Grace   I ve worked at an early stage startup before and I would do it again  It s important to me to meet the founders  I ll judge the opportunity based on the vision of the startup  what kind of impact I can have and who I will report to  If my direct manager is awesome then I will be much more likely to join   Jean   For me the first step is determining if joining an early stage startup is viable in my life right now  Sometimes the rest of life can tip the hand and determine if the risk is worth it or not  I ve only joined early startups when I know and trust at least one of the founders  I want to know what keeps them up at night  I have to understand and buy into the problem and solution and the vision  If there is a concrete timeline for a specific exit strategy that is a red flag  This is going to be a journey and we don t know exactly where the train is going  I will look for some degree of flexibility in the vision  Early stage  I look for a  we re all friends  attitude among the founders  There should be fiscal openness about the state of the business as much as possible  At later and larger stages  when there are 50 people or more  the company should have processes in place to run as a real business  At those places  I m less likely to know the founders and am simply buying into the vision for the product  the team manager and the prospects of a successful outcome   Marlyn   I d join an early stage startup only if the startup was working on something that aimed to improve how the world works on a fundamental level  And I don t mean just improving the world for a niche set of people  many startups seem to target only well off city dwellers  for example   but solving major problems for humanity  poverty  cancer  civil liberties  or pushing humanity s boundaries  space exploration  ageing   I would also have to believe the founders were capable of achieving their goals  I m a skeptical person  so this is huge   Klara   I ve only had one experience joining a super early stage team  I was the fifth employee  If I were to do it again  I would look for founders who ve run companies before  The person I worked for was a first time founder and he didn t know how to run a team of people effectively  He didn t have enough experience as a founder to handle tough interpersonal situations and he didn t have a co founder to help balance out his weaknesses  So I wouldn t work for a solo founder again either and I d likely only work with someone I d already worked with before  or at least had a personal connection to  so I d be able to vet them informally   If you have questions you d like to anonymously ask  or if you re a female software developer who would like to participate  please email ask ycombinator com,"[486 816

491,training-dataset/business/1244.txt,business,What really defines a growth team There s this coffee shop  Special Xtra  down an alleyway by our offices in San Francisco  Special Xtra  while charming  is quite literally a hole in the wall with an espresso machine  The mechanisms for selling or delivering their product   coffee and pastries   to the world is at an absolute bare minimum  In some ways  Special Xtra can be taken as a metaphor for an ultra early stage pre product market fit startup focused primarily on product   At the Boston stop of our 2016 Inside Intercom World Tour   I spoke about how we unraveled our discomfort with how others thought about growth and came to lay down our own definition for what a very Intercom growth team should look like   If so  what actually is a growth team  Why are so many other growth teams obsessed with micro optimizations and tactics  How do we take a step back and think more holistically about this set of problems   No business   certainly not one that wants or needs to grow   has the luxury of focusing on just product forever  at some point you have to start asking yourself   How do we start being deliberate about growth   For Intercom  this became top of mind around three years ago  It was around that point that our CEO tasked me with defining and building the growth team for Intercom   For Intercom  was critical as so much of how others spoke  wrote  and thought about growth didn t  and still doesn t  resonate   What we re doing isn t new  The core of our discomfort with growth teams starts at a fundamental place  what makes a startup a startup  Paul Graham attempted to answer this question in his canonical essay  Startup   Growth  emphasis added     A startup is a company designed to grow fast  Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup  Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology  or take venture funding  or have some sort of  exit     By this definition  everyone in a startup is  or should be  working on growth  Engineering teams don t exist to write code  Engineering teams exist to apply science to build products to grow the company  Marketing teams don t exist to make landing pages  Marketing teams exist to communicate the value of a product  service  or brand to grow the company   But how do growth teams grow a company  By growing the company  These more established functions   engineering  marketing  sales  etc    have a framing of the problem  and that framing of the problem becomes their tool for solving the problem  Most growth teams are defined by a desired outcome   growth   and nothing else  The lack of a framing means growth teams are given no frameworks to think about the world  no starting place  and ultimately little opportunity for success   Apply your average growth team to our coffee shop and they d build you the best cash register in the world before you d get a nice decor  or a roof to keep you dry while buying your  6 lattes   Onboarding  is not a new human activity   That said  there is some amount of convergence on the types of problems growth teams work on  onboarding  A B testing  activation  engagement  pricing  purchasing  conversion rate optimization  But what ties all these things together  Without answering that question  we re still in the dark  jumping from tactic to tactic without anything to guide us   So  let s take a step back and recognize some obvious truths   Packaging and selling products is not a new human activity  we ve been selling products for thousands of years  Onboarding is not a new human activity  it s no different than Ford manuals from 1919  A B testing isn t new either  randomized controlled trials were first reported used in a study for treating scurvy in the 1700s  Growth hacking isn t even new  back in 500 AD  Romans would display eggs  liver  and onions for sale floating in water so that they looked larger   Maybe the thing here is that we re not actually doing anything new  Maybe we just need to be a little less arrogant  a little more thoughtful  and take a broader view of history and the world  I think when we do that  we unlock a whole bunch of interesting inspiration and perspectives that can guide us in better defining and running  growth  teams   Look beyond software  I love furniture stores  You walk in and they have this amazing browse ability that no other buying experience has  while at the same time showing you how all different pieces fit together in a way that you could never imagine yourself  What software experience encourages this sort of exploration   Le Creuset do an amazing job in their marketing of showing fundamentally mundane products  cookware  and how they emotionally tie into your life  Look at any clothing catalog ever and it s selling a better you   Think about Apple stores  Is there any experience buying software that is remotely comparable to how good an experience buying Apple products is  There s this famous story  that probably isn t true  of Steve Jobs going down to the Palo Alto Apple store  He would adjust all the laptop displays to be at a 90 degree angle  Someone challenged Steve   why are you doing that  that s not how people use laptops   and he responded   Exactly  It looks wrong and people will feel compelled to adjust it  and be drawn in    I don t think it even matters whether it s true or not  What matters is you believe it could be true because of the obvious amount of thought and care that Apple has put into every detail of their stores and the experience of buying their products   Visit an Abercrombie store and every one of your senses will be blasted with different dimensions of their brand  be it through smell  sound  light  Where is there anything like that in our world   Think of how enjoyable browsing a bookstore is  You re able to consume so much information in such a lightweight and pleasant way  Think of how much better this is than browsing the app store    Software is eating the world      Marc Andreessen  It s through the lens of this famous Marc Andreessen quote that we can actually understand what a growth team is  The problems a growth team works on are not new  All these other examples  they re all thinking about how their products are bought  about optimizing those experiences  about conversion  about trying new things   A growth team is a software team solving a company s business problems   So what is a growth team  A growth team is simply a stop gap while sales and marketing teams learn to build software themselves  Think about kids in high school today  or in elementary school  growing up surrounded by software  When these kids go on to be our future sales and marketing leaders in 10 or 20 years  they ll be equipped to build world class software teams within their orgs  Until then  we have growth teams   More concretely  a growth team is a software team solving a company s business problems  Business problems that have existed for millennia  In contrast  a product team is a software team solving customer problems  The customer problems typically have existed for a long time also  So  how do we start being deliberate about growth  We now have a framing of the problem and a perspective on the world to help us answer this question   Forget about conversion rates  We need to think more holistically about the experiences we work on  Too many growth teams jump straight into optimizing some small micro piece of their funnel  For just a second  we need to forget about the conversion rates  Your users don t think or care about which stage of the funnel they re in  Take a step back and think about the overall experience  This is where the idea of the cash register comes in  The cash register is not how our coffee shop is going to increase its sales  but it may also be the most measurable thing at that point in the business s life   We need to look outside software for inspiration  We have many of the previous examples up on the wall of the growth team s conference room at Intercom  I don t believe there s any software businesses worth looking at for inspiration for how to better sell your product,"[491 754 1203 1110 486 1258 611 710 133 958 569]"

every major European region has produced a wealth of promising tech companies in just about every vertical  from mobile to cloud services  healthcare to social impact  and many more   However  the European startup ecosystem is still growing  and each country has its share of challenges and opportunities to traverse  which can make getting started confusing for aspiring entrepreneurs  Which is why we ve created an exhaustive guide that provides beginning founders in Europe with the basics they need to launch their companies   Legal Help for European Startups  Regardless of where you live and where your company is based  launching a startup requires founders to finalize numerous legal processes   like equity  intellectual property  and incorporation   to ensure smooth running enterprise  There are plenty of legal hurdles to go through before your company can become an officially recognized business entity  and to make matters worse  legal rules and regulations change from

some of the main benefits and drawbacks amongst of incorporating in the U K   Germany  and the U S       How to Raise Funding in Europe  While the United States may be the world s primary entrepreneurial hub  Europe is quickly making a name for itself as a growing center in the international startup scene  And while it may be easy for aspiring European founders to assume that the only way to raise significant startup funding is to travel to the United States  there are actually more and more financial resources cropping up in Europe everyday for burgeoning startups  The rise in investor activity has increased sharply in recent years  meaning that it is now easier than ever to for entrepreneurs to raise funding for their companies   In the Startupxplore article   Financing Options for Startups Looking for Funding in Europe   Jaime Novoa outlines some of the most popular means of fundraising for European startups   Crowdfunding  While it might seem like almost every startup uses crowdfunding to raise money  there s no denying that it s still an incredibly effective way for early stage startups to acquire funding while promoting their products at the same time  Kickstarter and Indiegogo are two of the most popular crowdfunding platforms  but there are other regional sites that may be more useful  depending on where you live in Europe  For example   Incubators and Accelerators  There is no doubt that the number of European startups has increased dramatically in recent years  which also means that the number of startup incubators and accelerators has grown as well  Below are some of the top institutions that you should consider joining   Equity Crowdfunding  If you are willing to give a portion of your company to investors in exchange for funding  equity crowdfunding is another option  Here is a list of several Europe based equity crowdfunding platforms   Syndicate Funding  This business model allows angel investors to syndicate deals with one another  This means that specific angel investors can lead investments in early stage startups and encourage other angel investors  as well as individual investors  to contribute funds to the investment  European entrepreneurs interested in syndicate funding are encouraged to check out Startupxplore  a startup funding community that aims to connect all startup professionals in Europe with its open  fast  and transparent startup financing system  Below are some other options for raising money from syndicates in Europe   P2P Lending Platforms  There has been a dramatic expansion in the use of P2P lending platforms throughout Europe  which provide loans to small and medium sized companies at lower interest rates than most banks  Below are some of Europe s most popular P2P lending platforms   Venture Capital Firms  Because of the sharp rise in entrepreneurial activity  more VC firms have launched to match the demand for startup funding in a variety of growing markets  including life sciences  energy  mobile  and more  Here are some of the top VC firms in Europe   Local and Continental Institutions  While not the most obvious or popular means of startup fundraising  budding founders who are willing to accept public money should look into various local and continental institutions that co invest with reputable VC firms  For example  there is the European Investment Fund  which is dedicated to fostering Europe s SMEs by increasing their financial access through various financial intermediaries   Startup Competitions  Startup competitions are a great way to not only raise funding for your startup  but to also increase your startup s brand awareness and receive some useful feedback from experts and potential customers  Luckily  Europe has no shortage of events that cater specifically to emerging tech companies  Here are just a few of the top competitions worth checking out   Click the image below for a full infographic on European funding options   Government Support for European Startups  Because of the rise in popularity of startups  European governments are slowly making more efforts to support local entrepreneurs as a means of spurring the economy and creating jobs  While each government initiative takes its own unique approach to fostering entrepreneurship  many of them have prioritized such core elements like ecosystem visibility  encouraging investments  ease of setting up a business  immigration  and business growth and acceleration   Below are some of the top startup initiatives and efforts that are backed by government support   Tech City UK  Tech City UK was launched in 2010 by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron and supports startups in Greater London  Manchester  and other major cities around the UK  With public funding from the UK Government s Department for Culture  Media   Sport  Tech City UK supports local entrepreneurs with targeted programs to help fill market gaps during the company s lifecycle  provides an agile and responsive feedback loop with the government  and connects the digital sector in London  the UK  and internationally via international trade missions  media engagement and events   La French Tech  La French Tech is a publicly funded initiative to promote French founders under a single brand in France  as well as those abroad  through a variety of activities  For example  they offer the French Tech Ticket  a program designed for non french entrepreneurs from around the world who want to launch startup in or relocate to Paris  Another one of their programs is the Talent Passport  a quick and easy administrative process to obtain working visas in France if they are investors  researchers  tech employees  or other related roles   Enterprise Ireland  Enterprise Ireland is a government organisation whose mission is to accelerate the development and growth of Irish companies in world markets  Working in partnership with Irish startups  Enterprise Ireland supports sustainable economic growth  regional development  and create jobs by helping local founders start  grow  innovate  and win export sales in global markets  They also provide funding and resources for college based researchers to assist in the development of emerging technologies into industry  and helps connect prospective investors with promising companies   Startup Lisboa  Startup Lisboa is a startup incubator that was founded in 2011 by the Lisbon Municipality  Bank Montepio  and IAPMEI  Portuguese Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation IP   Designed to help founders launch their companies and offer support during the first years of creation  Startup Lisboa also provides companies office space  connections to strategic partners  and access to investments  Companies that are selected to participate are given expert mentorship and are taught how to attract customers and investors  scale up  and expand globally   Tekes  Tekes is a publicly funded organisation created to finance research  development  and innovation in Finland  This program works with Finland s top innovative companies and research institutions  financing about 1 500 business research and development projects  and almost 600 public research projects at universities each year  As part of the Team Finland network  Tekes provides funding and support towards internationalising companies and attracting foreign investments to Finland  And as a bonus for participating companies  Tekes doesn t derive any financial profit from its activities  nor does it claim any intellectual proprietary rights   Final Thoughts  While this guide is in no way the final word on the European startup ecosystem as every country and every city has its own unique terrain that presents unique obstacles and resources for aspiring entrepreneurs  making it impossible to include them all in one post  But hopefully  there should be enough information here for European founders to get started  As you set out to launch your dream company  get out there and explore your local startup community  as it is always changing and growing  which means founders today have to be more resourceful and versatile than ever

534,training-dataset/business/1192.txt,business,Co founder conflictHere s how it felt in the weeks before I resigned from my last startup  I couldn t sleep  I couldn t eat  Resting pulse at 120  I had reached a point where I couldn t agree with my co founder over the future of the company  I had to step away from the startup for which I shed blood  sweat and tears  I didn t want to do it  but I reached a point  physically and mentally  where I couldn t handle the stress anymore   This is the first public post in which I ve ever talked about it  but through advising hundreds of startups  I ve learned that my story is not uncommon   Every co founder situation is different  but one common problem that keeps popping up revolves around how the founders engage in conflict  either not enough  or far too much   Being successful will mask co founder problems  Founder drama happens even in situations where you wouldn t expect it to crop up  Success will cover up many sins  When things are going up and to the right  things might be going wrong underneath and you won t be aware of it  It s the black ice of startups  It s dangerous because every startup will hit the skids sooner or later  You can t count on good times forever   winter is coming   Posterous  the startup I co founded in 2008  grew 10X yearly and became a top 200 Quantcast website in that time  But by the end of 2010  growth had flatlined  When things were going well  we were too busy keeping the site online to have anything to disagree about   I learned the hard way that if you haven t prepared for conflict in your co founder relationship  you ll be at each other s throats right at the moment when you most need to be working well together   We learned history is not enough   you ve got to maintain it like any relationship   The mistake that my co founder and I made was in avoiding the dynamics of our co founder marriage altogether  We rarely spoke directly and honestly with one another  We didn t stop to reflect on what he needed or I needed  We never sought professional support to ensure the health of our partnership  When the honeymoon ended  there was no healthy foundation to support the company   During my time as a partner at Y Combinator  we always looked closely at how well co founders knew each other before they started  Most people think of good co founding pairs in purely functional terms  a business person paired with a technical person  This is deeper than that  because when conflict does arise  and it always does   if you have nothing in common other than the startup  you ll struggle to find common ground at the worst of times  It s necessary for founders to have something in common  but not sufficient in and of itself   In my case  I had known my co founder for more than eight years  and we had been friends since college  We had history  but we learned history is not enough   you ve got to maintain it like any relationship  It isn t enough that you ve been friends for years  It matters what your relationship is like now   Avoiding conflict  With hindsight  I now realize my rift with my co founder was entirely preventable  We stopped spending time together because we were avoiding conflict  I wanted so much for us to succeed  and I wanted so much for us to be great co founders  and to maintain the narrative that we were close and had a good partnership  that I skipped the hard work that it takes to get that relationship and do our best work  embracing conflict and resolving it  It s a problem that I ve recognized over and over again in founders with whom I ve worked both as an advisor and investor   If you haven t spent time together outside of work  ask yourself why  If you see your co founder coming down the hall  do you alter your course to avoid them  Do you try to keep your interactions at a minimum  If so  that s a clear sign you re avoiding conflict by just avoiding them  period  That s just not going to work   Founders sometimes take the avoidance route to an extreme  One recently told me that he decided to talk to his co founder only once monthly  claiming it to be the only valid way forward  This was a pretty extreme case of avoidant behavior  I told them they had to either radically spend 10X more time working through issues and resolving them  or prepare to split   Successful co founders actually embrace conflict   It s the same script all over again  Co founder conflict is bad  so if we minimize how often it happens  that s the best possible case  It s a trap   My executive coach  Cameron Yarbrough  points out that this is usually the moment the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse show up  defensiveness  criticism  contempt and stonewalling  When psychologist John Gottman  author of the Four Horseman concept  identifies those behaviors in marital relationships  he s able to predict relationship failure with uncanny accuracy  The same thing holds true for co founders   Successful co founders actually embrace conflict  and are constantly in the process of resolving it  If you can t argue and arrive at the best solution  you re not doing the work to actually have a real  healthy working relationship   You have to actually lean into the conflict and come out with a solution that makes sense  over and over again  If you find yourself avoiding it  then you have to consciously expend effort to fight that default behavior   Don t agree on something  Don t leave the room until you have a resolution   An hour is not enough  Cancel your weekend  go on a hike and figure it out   In these situations  there s nothing more important than for you and your co founders to do the work and come out of it stronger   Too much conflict  Establish boundaries  Of course  fighting all the time is no good either  It s a recipe for a frayed relationship sooner or later  When founders are in a situation where they are fighting about everything all the time  it usually means that their individual roles are not well defined enough  Two hacker founders refuse to give up ground over an architectural decision  product oriented founders with similar skill sets fight over direction and so on   Here s the best way to handle it  Make a list of all of the areas needed for your business  Then figure out who is best at each part  and assign one person to it  If someone s better at sales  they should own that  Likewise for DevOps or any other specific task that is core to your business  That person is officially the owner of that thing  Everyone agrees to hear each other out when a decision comes up  but once the owner decides  all debate is over  Everyone moves on  You can t debate things forever  and co founders need to be able to trust each other   Embracing conflict  fighting fair  If this is your first company  this might be the first time you ve had to make decisions at this stage  What does it actually mean to embrace conflict  What is fighting fair   Embrace conflict instead of abandoning yourself  Some founders know what they want  and know what s right  but give up before the fight even starts  If this sounds like you  don t feel bad about it   that was me too  I ve always valued harmony in my interactions with everyone I work with  But with time  and  again  sometimes the hard way  I ve learned you can t sacrifice what you know to be right in order to get to that harmony early  You ve got to fight  Don t swallow your words  If you have a point  make sure you are heard   It s not aggression either  You shouldn t bulldog your way to a decision  The loudest in the room shouldn t necessarily and automatically be the one who wins  This is actually conflict avoidance of a different stripe   one that doesn t give any space to any competing idea at all  You may be sure you re right  but in a fair and balanced conflict  there s no downside to listening first and letting the other side know you hear them   Co founders need to be able to trust each other   Fighting fair is collaborative and data based  One concrete thing before you start to work through conflict is to always remind yourselves  You re on the same team   Everyone in the room wants to win  and all of you want to make this company successful  With that  you re ready to go talk about the problem as a process  where different viewpoints are aired and evaluated directly  You fail at this only when you try to skip to the end  either by giving up before you begin  self abandonment  or asserting you re right before anyone even gets to get a word in edgewise   One concrete way to get more direct experience with this is what s called a T Group  which is a technique developed for the Stanford GSB s Interpersonal Dynamics program to train people in precisely this kind of fighting fair  Nonprofit InnerSpace regularly hosts them  and many founders describe the experience as being extremely valuable   Get help  Some of you reading this will have been through all of the exercises above  and more  For those of you who are at the end of your rope with your co founders  I have one final piece of advice  Get help   Related Articles Resolving Co Founder Disputes  Talk to your most trusted friends  investors and mentors  Startups are crazy things  after all  You re trying to do something nobody else has done  and it can feel very lonely  like you re the only one who has ever had this problem  Trust me  it helps to get outside of your head and talk through what you re seeing with other founders and friends   Don t be afraid to bring in the pros  Be open to getting professional help  either individually  to help you respond to the ongoing conflict  or as a group  similar to how a marriage counselor can save a marriage   I can t recommend executive coaching enough for founders  especially when a company killing conflict is on the line  You have employees and customers who depend on you to make the right call  and you owe it to them to make sure you do  Athletes have coaches and trainers who help them get to peak performance  Knowledge work can be just as demanding  and I ve seen many founders find their partnerships saved this way   Co founder disputes are the No  1 early startup killer  but it doesn t have to be that way  Co founder disputes have historically been one of the top reasons startups fail at the earliest possible stage  Most that do fail do so because conflict  either too much or too little  is left unresolved for too long  with these tools  you ll at least be a little more prepared against that possibility   Embrace the conflict   just the right amount   and you ll get through this  too   Thanks to my executive coach  Cameron Yarbrough  for reading drafts of this,"[534 569 486 1258 626 1208 611 603 710 377 958]"
546,training-dataset/business/154.txt,business,Organic Startup Ideas        Want to start a startup  Get funded by Y Combinator   April 2010    The best way to come up with startup ideas is to ask yourself the question  what do you wish someone would make for you     There are two types of startup ideas  those that grow organically out of your own life  and those that you decide  from afar  are going to be necessary to some class of users other than you  Apple was the first type  Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a computer  Unlike most people who wanted computers  he could design one  so he did  And since lots of other people wanted the same thing  Apple was able to sell enough of them to get the company rolling  They still rely on this principle today  incidentally  The iPhone is the phone Steve Jobs wants    1      Our own startup  Viaweb  was of the second type  We made software for building online stores  We didn t need this software ourselves  We weren t direct marketers  We didn t even know when we started that our users were called  direct marketers   But we were comparatively old when we started the company  I was 30 and Robert Morris was 29   so we d seen enough to know users would need this type of software    2      There is no sharp line between the two types of ideas  but the most successful startups seem to be closer to the Apple type than the Viaweb type  When he was writing that first Basic interpreter for the Altair  Bill Gates was writing something he would use  as were Larry and Sergey when they wrote the first versions of Google     Organic ideas are generally preferable to the made up kind  but particularly so when the founders are young  It takes experience to predict what other people will want  The worst ideas we see at Y Combinator are from young founders making things they think other people will want     So if you want to start a startup and don t know yet what you re going to do  I d encourage you to focus initially on organic ideas  What s missing or broken in your daily life  Sometimes if you just ask that question you ll get immediate answers  It must have seemed obviously broken to Bill Gates that you could only program the Altair in machine language     You may need to stand outside yourself a bit to see brokenness  because you tend to get used to it and take it for granted  You can be sure it s there  though  There are always great ideas sitting right under our noses  In 2004 it was ridiculous that Harvard undergrads were still using a Facebook printed on paper  Surely that sort of thing should have been online     There are ideas that obvious lying around now  The reason you re overlooking them is the same reason you d have overlooked the idea of building Facebook in 2004  organic startup ideas usually don t seem like startup ideas at first  We know now that Facebook was very successful  but put yourself back in 2004  Putting undergraduates  profiles online wouldn t have seemed like much of a startup idea  And in fact  it wasn t initially a startup idea  When Mark spoke at a YC dinner this winter he said he wasn t trying to start a company when he wrote the first version of Facebook  It was just a project  So was the Apple I when Woz first started working on it  He didn t think he was starting a company  If these guys had thought they were starting companies  they might have been tempted to do something more  serious   and that would have been a mistake     So if you want to come up with organic startup ideas  I d encourage you to focus more on the idea part and less on the startup part  Just fix things that seem broken  regardless of whether it seems like the problem is important enough to build a company on  If you keep pursuing such threads it would be hard not to end up making something of value to a lot of people  and when you do  surprise  you ve got a company    3      Don t be discouraged if what you produce initially is something other people dismiss as a toy  In fact  that s a good sign  That s probably why everyone else has been overlooking the idea  The first microcomputers were dismissed as toys  And the first planes  and the first cars  At this point  when someone comes to us with something that users like but that we could envision forum trolls dismissing as a toy  it makes us especially likely to invest     While young founders are at a disadvantage when coming up with made up ideas  they re the best source of organic ones  because they re at the forefront of technology  They use the latest stuff  They only just decided what to use  so why wouldn t they  And because they use the latest stuff  they re in a position to discover valuable types of fixable brokenness first     There s nothing more valuable than an unmet need that is just becoming fixable  If you find something broken that you can fix for a lot of people  you ve found a gold mine  As with an actual gold mine  you still have to work hard to get the gold out of it  But at least you know where the seam is  and that s the hard part             Notes      1   This suggests a way to predict areas where Apple will be weak  things Steve Jobs doesn t use  E g  I doubt he is much into gaming       2   In retrospect  we should have become direct marketers  If I were doing Viaweb again  I d open our own online store  If we had  we d have understood users a lot better  I d encourage anyone starting a startup to become one of its users  however unnatural it seems       3   Possible exception  It s hard to compete directly with open source software  You can build things for programmers  but there has to be some part you can charge for     Thanks to Sam Altman  Trevor Blackwell  and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this,"[546 611 1258 759 569 746 122

569,training-dataset/business/1124.txt,business,Jessica Livingston s Pretty Complete List on How Not to Fail   The MacroJessica Livingston  co founder of Y Combinator  spoke at our Female Founders Conference   For weekly recaps of The Macro  sign up here   Here s Jessica s keynote from our third annual Female Founders Conference  which brought together more than 800 women building women led startups   Jessica has seen over 1000 companies go through YC and shares her learnings about what it takes to succeed as a founder  She emphasizes the importance of avoiding distraction and making something people want   Nothing else you do will matter if you re not making something people want  You can be the best spokesperson  the best fundraiser  the best programmer  but if you aren t building a product that satisfies a real need  you ll never succeed        While I ll tell you that it is going to be harder for you as a woman  it s not going to be so much harder that it will make the difference between success and failure  If you want to start a startup  go ahead and do it and don t let yourself be intimidated or distracted by all the noise   You can watch her entire talk and read it below   I want to start off today with some personal news  After working on Y Combinator for 11 years  I m going on sabbatical for the next year  I want to focus on some projects and  to be honest  I m a little tired  YC is one of my favorite things in the world  but it s also all consuming  and it s hard to work on something all consuming for 11 years without a break  I also want to spend more time with my sons  They re 7 and 4 now  and I won t be able to get these years back  So pretty much right after this conference  I ll be starting my sabbatical   And that brings us to the topic of my talk  I m going to tell you what I want you to remember while I m away  I was thinking about what I wanted YC s founders to remember while I was away  and I realized that everything I wanted to tell them was just as applicable to all of you  So I m giving you the exact same advice that I d give to YC founders   1  Make something people want   This is YC s motto  and after 11 years and more than 1000 startups  I know we picked the right one  Nothing else you do will matter if you are not making something people want  You can be the best spokesperson  the best fundraiser  the best programmer  but if you aren t building a product that satisfies a real need  you ll never succeed   My advice to those of you who are still looking for an idea is to solve a problem that you yourself have  Then you ll know it s something at least one person really wants  And when you re part of the target market  you ll have insights about it that you wouldn t otherwise   But you should graduate from making something just for yourself to making something for other people as fast as you can  And to know what they want  you have to understand them  Do they like what you ve made so far  If not  why not  Talk to your users as much as you can  even if that means doing things that don t scale early on  I don t know of a single case of a startup that felt they spent too much time talking to users   And be open to adjusting your idea  because most good ideas evolve   The most famous example of that sort of evolution in the YC community is probably Airbnb  They started with airbeds on floors for conferences  then airbeds on floors but without conferences  then actual bedrooms  then whole places  That final step happened  believe it or not  because Barry Manilow went on tour  His drummer was an early Airbnb host  back in the days when the host was expected to be there  One day he told the Airbnbs that Barry was going on tour and could he rent out his place while he was away  The Airbnbs really had to think about it  They were still AirBedandBreakfast back then  not Airbnb  so guests had to get breakfast  But in the end they said yes  and this type of stay is now most of Airbnb s business   Your users are your guidepost  And the way you stay on the right path in the early stages of a startup is to build stuff and talk to users  And nothing else   2  Stay focused   One of the most conspicuous patterns we ve seen among the thousand startups we ve funded is that the most successful founders are always totally focused on their product and their users  To the point of being fanatical  The best founders don t have time to get caught up in other things   Here s a list of things that I see easily distract founders  These are like the startup equivalent of wolves in sheeps  clothing    Grabbing coffee  with investors  Talking with potential acquirers  Networking  Recruiting boards of advisors  Doing a  partnership   thinking it will get you more users  Spending time on PR before you have made something people want  Arguing on social media  Going to conferences  Worrying about being a woman in tech  Notice this list implies you shouldn t be here  Here I am on stage at a conference  telling you that you shouldn t go to conferences  And honestly  as a rule you shouldn t  That s why we try so hard to make this conference good   because we know that it has to be more useful to you than spending the same time building things and talking to users  and that s a very high bar   3  Don t worry about being a woman   I want to talk a little more about that last point  worrying about being a woman in tech  since it s the only one on the list that s specific to this audience   There are some real obstacles women face as startup founders  But there is just so much talk and noise about this topic that I worry it will scare potential founders away  Also  it s hard to sift through everything and know what s accurate and what s not  The conversation around this topic is too often driven by people who are not actually building anything themselves  And as with any other topic  the amount of attention the press devotes to this issue is not determined by the size of the problem  but by its potential to generate page views  Controversy generates page views  so they write about controversy  You don t hear as much about the many female founders who are quietly and successfully building their companies   I don t give a shit about page views  What I care about is how I can help support female founders   The way I do it is to encourage women to start startups and help them succeed once they do  So while I ll tell you that it is going to be harder for you as a woman  it s not going to be so much harder that it will make the difference between success and failure  If you want to start a startup  just go ahead and do it  and don t let yourself be intimidated or distracted by all the noise all the news articles and Twitter controversy about how it s harder for you as a woman  That s not only the best plan for you personally  but it s also the best way to fix these problems   4  Measure your growth   If you do the first two things I told you  make something people want and focus  you ll get growth as a result  And that means you can use growth as a test of whether you re doing those two things  If you have a good growth rate  which in a startup means at least 10  per month  you re on the right track  And if you don t  you re missing at least one of the two ingredients I mentioned  You re either making the wrong thing  or not focusing enough   There s a famous sentence we often quote at Y Combinator  You make what you measure  Pick a number you want to grow  and focus on that  The best metric to choose is good old fashioned revenue  There s no better test of whether you re really making something people want   Focusing on growth also prevents you from being in denial  which is a big danger for startup founders  For some reason  a lot of the problems you face in a startup tend to provoke denial  Maybe it s simply because these problems are hard   Founders who are making the wrong thing are often in denial about it  Founders who are wasting their time on inessential stuff are often in denial about it  Denial is the silent killer of startups  But if you hold yourself to growth targets  you can t remain in denial  The numbers  good or bad  are staring you in the face   Unless of course you re in denial about the need to hold yourself to growth targets  And that  believe it or not  happens all the time  We constantly hear founders saying   We re not focusing on growth right now   There are times when that is the right thing to do  but I don t even need to tell you how things usually turn out after we hear that from founders   5  Know if you re default alive   Growth isn t enough  though  You can have a good growth rate and still die  if you run out of money and can t raise more   The critical question is whether you re what we call  default alive  or  default dead   Default alive means if your expenses stay the same and your revenue continues to grow at the rate it s been growing  you get to breakeven before you run out of money  Default dead means you don t   We now ask all YC founders to begin their investor updates to us by saying which of the two they are  As well as telling us how the startup is doing  it s a good way to yank the founders out of denial  Because being about to run out of money is another of those dangerous problems founders are often in denial about  You d be amazed how many founders don t even know whether they re default alive or default dead   6  Keep expenses low   Why do startups run out of money  By spending too much  And since the main expense in most startups is salaries  spending too much   hiring too many people  Overhiring is the big mistake in the second phase of a startup  as making something no one wants is in the first phase   I know how dangerous overhiring is  because YC startups constantly make this mistake despite us constantly warning them against it   The problem with overhiring is that it gives you less margin for error  The faster you re burning through the money you have in the bank  the less time you have to make it profitability  But startups  because they re usually both run by inexperienced founders and doing something novel  are exactly the type of thing that takes longer to get right than you expect  And that s a deadly combination  because if you start to run out of money before you have things working right  you have to raise more during a phase when the company is an  ugly duckling   Even if you re on the right track  you look bad right now  And investors don t like companies like that   So after you raise money  be very conservative about how you spend it  Hire for the pessimistic case  Assume it will take longer than you expect to get things working  If there s one thing you can forsee in a startup  it s unforseen problems   I constantly see startups that die even though they re on the right track  simply because they hired too fast   7  Fundraising gets harder   The reason startups get so slammed when they have to raise money as an ugly duckling is that later rounds of fundraising get much harder  Founders who had a fairly easy time raising a seed round think it will be just as easy to raise a series A  It s not   We often get emails from startups saying  we re running out of money  so we re going to raise a series A now   As if it were like making a second trip to the ATM  And when we ask how they re doing  the answer is usually a combination of slow growth and high expenses  We have to tell them they have no hope of raising a series A and that they ll have to make drastic changes even to survive   Series A investors have a totally different attitude from seed investors  Seed investors are looking for promise  Series A investors are looking for performance  They know that all the returns from venture investing are concentrated in the big winners  So they want to invest in you only if you are clearly on a path to being a big winner  They ll pay high prices if you are  But if you aren t  they won t invest at all  So even if you re on the right path  but still in the middle of converting promise to performance  they still won t invest  To them there s not much difference between a startup halfway along the right path  and a startup on the wrong path  If they don t see sufficient progress  they don t care why   Unicorns  I ve made startups sound pretty scary so far  I m sorry  I can t help myself sometimes  I ve just seen so much  The good news is  this is a pretty complete list  If you avoid all the mistakes I warn about here  you ll be in really good shape  If you start by making something people actually want  focus on making users happy  make sure you have a good growth rate and don t overhire  you ll be in a very happy position  You will be master of your own fate in a way that very few people ever get to be   We host this conference for two reasons  1  to inspire more women to start startups and 2  to try to help women who already have started startups become more successful   But I have a more specific goal than that  I want there not just to be more female founders  I want there to be more female founders of the big winners  The companies that some people call unicorns  These are the founders who make the most effective role models  and role models are what we need most if we want to encourage more women to take the leap and start their own companies   And you know where the founders of these big winners are going to come from  From this room   After funding over 1000 startups at Y Combinator  I know what it takes to start these super successful startups  And from meeting the people who came to past Female Founder Conferences  I know there are a lot of you in this room who have what it takes  Imagine the future we ll have if you go ahead and do it   Sign up for weekly recaps of The Macro,"[569 1258 611 958 759 486 754 710 626 546 377]"
603,training-dataset/business/1014.txt,business,How to Create the Perfect Cofounder Agreement with Your Business PartnerYou ve just conceived a brilliant billion dollar startup idea  you ve defined the perfect value proposition for you company  and you just met the perfect cofounder  or cofounders  to help you get your idea off the ground   You re ready to launch a startup  right   Not quite  If you plan on starting a business with others  it s imperative that you all set aside some time to discuss and work out a cofounder agreement  You may get along wonderfully at the outset  but as your company grows and expands  you may discover that you have differences regarding the future of your startup or its mission  And when these differences arise while the company is operating  this will only compound problems   However  we ve gathered the best opinions from top startup experts to help ensure that you and your partner align your goals and establish a strong cofounder relationship for your company   How to Ensure Alignment of Vision  As you and your cofounder  or cofounders  embark on your entrepreneurial journey together  it s imperative that you all share the same vision for the purpose and future of your company  It s easy to get caught up in the thrill of launching a potentially successful startup together  but you all must take the time to establish the existential foundations of the company  and as early as possible  to help prevent the possibility of a drastic falling out later on   In the guest blog post  8 Issues You Need to Discuss with Your Co Founder  on CoFoundersLab  David Ehrenberg  CEO of Early Growth Financial Services  outlines several concerns that cofounders must address before launching a company together  Below are some of the most important ones  organized by topic   What Are Your Goals   Why are you creating this startup   What need will it fill   What will your initial product service offering be   And what is your strategy for growing the company   What Are Your Company Values and Philosophy   Your company s success depends on vision alignment  alignment between you and your investors  your employees  and your customers  etc    Do you share the same priorities  Do you agree on what s most important to you both personally and for the future of your company   How Do You Measure Success   What do you and your co founder s  hope to get out of this business   How will you know if you ve achieved your goals   If you don t agree on the same goals  how will you know when you ve achieved them   Discussing these issues with your co founder could get uncomfortable  create rifts  or even uncover deal breakers  If you are able to successfully have these difficult conversations  this is a testament to your partnership and to the strength of your relationship    and will serve as a solid foundation from which to grow your business     David Ehrenberg  Working Styles and Culture  Once you and your cofounder have laid down the aspirational and philosophical groundwork for your startup  this is also the ideal time to determine what kind of working environment best complements the vision of your startup   In the FounderDating blog post   34 Questions to Ask a Potential Co Founder   Jessica Alter  Founder and CEO of FounderDating  lists the questions you should ask your cofounder to define your ideal working conditions for your company   What 3 words best describe the startup culture you want to create  e g  open  hard working  eccentric  etc    Pro tip  If you re really serious and far along go visit few office spaces together to get a sense of what each of you likes work environments wise and why  What values do we want to instill in our employees  If you could pick 2 things to change about our company  and two things to bring with you from your previous experience  what would they be and why  How much equity are we allocating for future employees  What should we look for in our first 5 hires  Describe your ideal working style   And as exhaustive as this list might be  in order to really understand how you work with someone you have to    actually work with them  Once you ve agreed you re aligned on a lot of the categories above  start a side project  go to a hackathon  or 2   It s really the only way to tell     Jessica Alter  How to Determine Roles  Once you and your founding team have settled on the overall scope and mission of your company  take the time to define your respective roles and which team member will oversee what  While the functions of formal roles tend to change  especially for recently established startups   the Steve Robbins penned Entrepreneur article   Build Your Management Team   outlines the general functions of each formal role  The definitions below should help you get started picking your respective roles   Chief Executive Officer  CEO   Basically  the CEO is the boss of everyone at the company and is responsible for everything  They determine the company s strategy  hire and build the senior team  and make the final call on how resources are used   Chief Operating Officer  COO   The COO handles a company s complex operational details and insures the business can deliver each day  as well as figures out what needs to be measured to determine if things are going well   Chief Financial Officer  CFO   Your CFO handles the money by creating budgets and financing strategies  CFOs make decisions like if it s better for your business to lease or buy  and build the control systems that monitor your company s financial health   President  The role of a president is often somewhat vague  and many startups feel they are unnecessary  Some say a president oversees staff functions  like human resources  finance and strategy  while others state that the president is essentially the same as a COO  but for smaller companies Think long and hard about whether your company needs someone to fill this title  or if your company is fully covered with a CEO and COO   Chief Marketing Officer  CMO   The CMO manages the marketing strategy  and often the sales strategy  and oversees its implementation  The CMO should know your industry inside out  and helps you position your product  make it stand out from existing products  and make ensures that customers learn to crave your product   Chief Technology Officer  CTO   A CTO keeps abreast with technology trends  integrates those trends into the company s strategy  and makes sure the company keeps current when necessary  If technology impacts your business or industry strategically  you ll need a CTO on hand   Building your team demands matching jobs to people s strengths  That means giving people responsibilities according to skill level  not based on how close a friend they are  or how closely related they are to you  or whether you just like their sunny personality  That includes you as well   don t give yourself an impressive title and job unless you re right for the job     Steve Robbins  Legal Decisions   Definitions  Most founders who set out to launch tech companies have little to no legal experience  which can lead to problems down the road  especially when investors and lawyers get involved  While entrepreneurs aren t required become legal experts to build companies  taking the time to become with basic legal practices can only benefit one s company  To get you started below are several elementary legal questions you and your cofounder should address  taken from the Forbes article   10 Big Legal Mistakes Made By Startups   by Richard Harroch   General Questions  Is the percentage ownership subject to vesting based on continued participation in the business   If one founder leaves  does the company or the other founder have the right to buy back that founder s shares  At what price   What salaries  if any   are the founders entitled to  How can that be changed   How are key decisions and day to day decisions of the business to be made   Basic Legal Definitions  Harroch s article also explores numerous basic legal terms associated with launching a startup  all of which you and your business partner should familiarize yourselves with   Confidentiality Agreements   These are also referred to as Non Disclosure Agreements or NDAs  The purpose of the agreement is to allow the holder of confidential information to share it with a third party     These are also referred to as Non Disclosure Agreements or NDAs  The purpose of the agreement is to allow the holder of confidential information to share it with a third party  Copyright   A copyright gives the owner the exclusive right to make copies of the work and to prepare derivative works  such as sequels or revisions  based on the work     A copyright gives the owner the exclusive right to make copies of the work and to prepare derivative works  such as sequels or revisions  based on the work  General Partnership   If there is more than one founder  a general partnership is often chosen as the legal form of business entity     If there is more than one founder  a general partnership is often chosen as the legal form of business entity  Patent   A patent gives its inventor the right to prevent others from making  using  or selling the patented subjected matter described in words in the patent s claims     A patent gives its inventor the right to prevent others from making  using  or selling the patented subjected matter described in words in the patent s claims  Service marks   Service marks resemble trademarks and are used to identify services     Service marks resemble

credits     Depending on the nature of the business  various tax incentives may be available  such as renewable energy tax credits and investment tax credits  Trademark   A trademark right protects

 name  symbol  or device that the trademark owner used to identify or distinguish its good from those of others  Trade Secret   A trade secret right allows the owner of the right to take action against anyone who breaches an agreement or confidential relationship or who steals or uses other improper means to obtain secret information   You absolutely have to agree with your co founders early on what the deal is among you  Not doing so can cause enormous problems later  see  for example  the Zuckerberg Winklevoss Facebook litigation   In a way  think of the founder agreement as a form of  pre nuptial agreement      Richard Harroch  Now let s take a look at a couple more advanced startup legal topics that you should address when launching a company with others  In  Common Legal Mistakes Made by Startups  And How You Can Avoid Them    Matt Glick of Legal Hero expounds on the requirements for establishing a solid legal foundation for a startup   Include a Vesting Schedule When Issuing Shares to Co founders  When you create a vesting schedule  this means that the co founder will earn their shares over time and protects you and the company if that a co founder leaves the company or doesn t pull their weight  The standard vesting period is four years  with monthly vesting of shares  Unvested shares should be subject to repurchase by the company if the co founder leaves the company   Protect Your Valuable Intellectual Property  If intellectual property is a vital element of your business  it s important to protect that IP during the formative stages of a company  You can address this issue by relying on patents  trademarks  copyrights  and trade secrets to protect your valuable IP  Another step you can take is requiring all co founders and any third party developers to assign to the company their rights in IP they created and that is utilized by the company  Doing this will help prevent trouble if a co founder leaves the company and takes a crucial patent with them   With so many demands on your time  one of the areas that often slips through the cracks is establishing a solid legal foundation for your company  Although there is no set amount of time  energy  and money a company should spend on legal early on  if you re operating in a heavily regulated area   such as crowdfunding  payments  or health care   you ll want to focus more on legal than if you re creating the next Candy Crush     Matt Glick  How to Split Equity  And now for the part you ve all been waiting for  how to split equity among cofounders  While it may easy to merely assume that splitting equity equally between cofounders is the way to go  once you start delving into into who brings what to the company  you ll discover that  equal share  doesn t add up to  fair share   Just ask Dan Shapiro  CEO of Glowforge and Founder Institute Mentor  In his GeekWire article   The only wrong answer is 50 50  Calculating the co founder equity split   Dan posits that equity share should be calculated from the founder s worth  Here s what Dan has to say on determining equity share from what each founder contributes   Ideas are Valuable  If you brought the original concept to the table  increase your share holdings by about 5 percent  While execution is more important in the long run  whoever conceived the original idea deserves a little extra credit   That First Step is a Doozy  Bringing something of value to the company during its formative stages   like a filed patent  not a provisional   a compelling demo  an early version of the product  or something else that means much of the work towards financing or revenue is already done   you should receive a considerable part of the equity   Full Time Commitment is Expensive  Bottom line  if you re working more  then you re risking a lot more if the project fails  which means that you are entitled to more if the project succeeds  Also  keep in mind that part time cofounders are a big minus to someone considering an investment  so choose your partners wisely   The CEO Gets More  Always   Splitting equity equally means that no one controls the company more than anyone else  But if that s the case  than having a CEO is useless  as well as having any form of upper management  So  whoever is the designated CEO should get another slightly more equity  If you think that s unfair  remember that market rate for a great CEO is higher than market rate for a great CTO  which means that s how it is everywhere   Reputation Counts  If you re a beginning entrepreneur and your partner is an experienced founder with an established reputation  they deserve more equity  If that founder has an expansive network that benefits the company  they deserve more equity  If that founder can help secure more funding for your company  they deserve more equity   The question of equity brings out the most fundamental differences  perceptions  and values in an aspiring startup  In fact the equity question  more than any other  may strangle a young company before it can even get started  And that s a damn good thing     Dan Shapiro  If you want more information on such a sensitive topic  check out our previous blog posts on the matter   And as a bonus  be sure to download the Co Founder Equity Split Spreadsheet has 5 different calculators in it  and a final box that averages everything out among all five   Final Thoughts  Yes  talking about such topics as company roles and vision and equity and the like can be uncomfortable among founders  However  these discussions are vital to a successful partnership  as well as a successful startup  and must be held before any of you invest too much time  energy  and money into a potential company  Keep in mind that whoever you decide to launch a company with  you all will have to make countless difficult decisions once your company is actually up and running  If you take nothing else from this blog post  at least follow the bit of advice below   Choose co founders the way you would choose a spouse  The reality is that you will  at least in the early days  spend far more time with your co founders than your partner     Danielle

611,training-dataset/business/818.txt,business,How to Get Startup Ideas        Want to start a startup  Get funded by Y Combinator   November 2012    The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas  It s to look for problems  preferably problems you have yourself     The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common  they re something the founders themselves want  that they themselves can build  and that few others realize are worth doing  Microsoft  Apple  Yahoo  Google  and Facebook all began this way     Problems    Why is it so important to work on a problem you have  Among other things  it ensures the problem really exists  It sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist  And yet by far the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has     I made it myself  In 1995 I started a company to put art galleries online  But galleries didn t want to be online  It s not how the art business works  So why did I spend 6 months working on this stupid idea  Because I didn t pay attention to users  I invented a model of the world that didn t correspond to reality  and worked from that  I didn t notice my model was wrong until I tried to convince users to pay for what we d built  Even then I took embarrassingly long to catch on  I was attached to my model of the world  and I d spent a lot of time on the software  They had to want it     Why do so many founders build things no one wants  Because they begin by trying to think of startup ideas  That m o  is doubly dangerous  it doesn t merely yield few good ideas  it yields bad ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them     At YC we call these  made up  or  sitcom  startup ideas  Imagine one of the characters on a TV show was starting a startup  The writers would have to invent something for it to do  But coming up with good startup ideas is hard  It s not something you can do for the asking  So  unless they got amazingly lucky  the writers would come up with an idea that sounded plausible  but was actually bad     For example  a social network for pet owners  It doesn t sound obviously mistaken  Millions of people have pets  Often they care a lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them  Surely many of these people would like a site where they could talk to other pet owners  Not all of them perhaps  but if just 2 or 3 percent were regular visitors  you could have millions of users  You could serve them targeted offers  and maybe charge for premium features    1      The danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your friends with pets  they don t say  I would never use this   They say  Yeah  maybe I could see using something like that   Even when the startup launches  it will sound plausible to a lot of people  They don t want to use it themselves  at least not right now  but they could imagine other people wanting it  Sum that reaction across the entire population  and you have zero users    2      Well    When a startup launches  there have to be at least some users who really need what they re making not just people who could see themselves using it one day  but who want it urgently  Usually this initial group of users is small  for the simple reason that if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually puts into a version one  it would probably already exist  Which means you have to compromise on one dimension  you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount  or something a small number of people want a large amount  Choose the latter  Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas  but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type     Imagine a graph whose x axis represents all the people who might want what you re making and whose y axis represents how much they want it  If you invert the scale on the y axis  you can envision companies as holes  Google is an immense crater  hundreds of millions of people use it  and they need it a lot  A startup just starting out can t expect to excavate that much volume  So you have two choices about the shape of hole you start with  You can either dig a hole that s broad but shallow  or one that s narrow and deep  like a well     Made up startup ideas are usually of the first type  Lots of people are mildly interested in a social network for pet owners     Nearly all good startup ideas are of the second type  Microsoft was a well when they made Altair Basic  There were only a couple thousand Altair owners  but without this software they were programming in machine language  Thirty years later Facebook had the same shape  Their first site was exclusively for Harvard students  of which there are only a few thousand  but those few thousand users wanted it a lot     When you have an idea for a startup  ask yourself  who wants this right now  Who wants this so much that they ll use it even when it s a crappy version one made by a two person startup they ve never heard of  If you can t answer that  the idea is probably bad    3      You don t need the narrowness of the well per se  It s depth you need  you get narrowness as a byproduct of optimizing for depth  and speed   But you almost always do get it  In practice the link between depth and narrowness is so strong that it s a good sign when you know that an idea will appeal strongly to a specific group or type of user     But while demand shaped like a well is almost a necessary condition for a good startup idea  it s not a sufficient one  If Mark Zuckerberg had built something that could only ever have appealed to Harvard students  it would not have been a good startup idea  Facebook was a good idea because it started with a small market there was a fast path out of  Colleges are similar enough that if you build a facebook that works at Harvard  it will work at any college  So you spread rapidly through all the colleges  Once you have all the college students  you get everyone else simply by letting them in     Similarly for Microsoft  Basic for the Altair  Basic for other machines  other languages besides Basic  operating systems  applications  IPO     Self    How do you tell whether there s a path out of an idea  How do you tell whether something is the germ of a giant company  or just a niche product  Often you can t  The founders of Airbnb didn t realize at first how big a market they were tapping  Initially they had a much narrower idea  They were going to let hosts rent out space on their floors during conventions  They didn t foresee the expansion of this idea  it forced itself upon them gradually  All they knew at first is that they were onto something  That s probably as much as Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg knew at first     Occasionally it s obvious from the beginning when there s a path out of the initial niche  And sometimes I can see a path that s not immediately obvious  that s one of our specialties at YC  But there are limits to how well this can be done  no matter how much experience you have  The most important thing to understand about paths out of the initial idea is the meta fact that these are hard to see     So if you can t predict whether there s a path out of an idea  how do you choose between ideas  The truth is disappointing but interesting  if you re the right sort of person  you have the right sort of hunches  If you re at the leading edge of a field that s changing fast  when you have a hunch that something is worth doing  you re more likely to be right     In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance  Robert Pirsig says  You want to know how to paint a perfect painting  It s easy  Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally  I ve wondered about that passage since I read it in high school  I m not sure how useful his advice is for painting specifically  but it fits this situation well  Empirically  the way to have good startup ideas is to become the sort of person who has them     Being at the leading edge of a field doesn t mean you have to be one of the people pushing it forward  You can also be at the leading edge as a user  It was not so much because he was a programmer that Facebook seemed a good idea to Mark Zuckerberg as because he used computers so much  If you d asked most 40 year olds in 2004 whether they d like to publish their lives semi publicly on the Internet  they d have been horrified at the idea  But Mark already lived online  to him it seemed natural     Paul Buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field  live in the future   Combine that with Pirsig and you get  Live in the future  then build what s missing  That describes the way many if not most of the biggest startups got started  Neither Apple nor Yahoo nor Google nor Facebook were even supposed to be companies at first  They grew out of things their founders built because there seemed a gap in the world     If you look at the way successful founders have had their ideas  it s generally the result of some external stimulus hitting a prepared mind  Bill Gates and Paul Allen hear about the Altair and think  I bet we could write a Basic interpreter for it   Drew Houston realizes he s forgotten his USB stick and thinks  I really need to make my files live online   Lots of people heard about the Altair  Lots forgot USB sticks  The reason those stimuli caused those founders to start companies was that their experiences had prepared them to notice the opportunities they represented     The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not  think up  but  notice   At YC we call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders  own experiences  organic  startup ideas  The most successful startups almost all begin this way     That may not have been what you wanted to hear  You may have expected recipes for coming up with startup ideas  and instead I m telling you that the key is to have a mind that s prepared in the right way  But disappointing though it may be  this is the truth  And it is a recipe of a sort  just one that in the worst case takes a year rather than a weekend     If you re not at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field  you can get to one  For example  anyone reasonably smart can probably get to an edge of programming  e g  building mobile apps  in a year  Since a successful startup will consume at least 3 5 years of your life  a year s preparation would be a reasonable investment  Especially if you re also looking for a cofounder    4      You don t have to learn programming to be at the leading edge of a domain that s changing fast  Other domains change fast  But while learning to hack is not necessary  it is for the forseeable future sufficient  As Marc Andreessen put it  software is eating the world  and this trend has decades left to run     Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas  you ll be able to implement them  That s not absolutely necessary  Jeff Bezos couldn t  but it s an advantage  It s a big advantage  when you re considering an idea like putting a college facebook online  if instead of merely thinking  That s an interesting idea   you can think instead  That s an interesting idea  I ll try building an initial version tonight   It s even better when you re both a programmer and the target user  because then the cycle of generating new versions and testing them on users can happen inside one head     Noticing    Once you re living in the future in some respect  the way to notice startup ideas is to look for things that seem to be missing  If you re really at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field  there will be things that are obviously missing  What won t be obvious is that they re startup ideas  So if you want to find startup ideas  don t merely turn on the filter  What s missing   Also turn off every other filter  particularly  Could this be a big company   There s plenty of time to apply that test later  But if you re thinking about that initially  it may not only filter out lots of good ideas  but also cause you to focus on bad ones     Most things that are missing will take some time to see  You almost have to trick yourself into seeing the ideas around you     But you know the ideas are out there  This is not one of those problems where there might not be an answer  It s impossibly unlikely that this is the exact moment when technological progress stops  You can be sure people are going to build things in the next few years that will make you think  What did I do before x      And when these problems get solved  they will probably seem flamingly obvious in retrospect  What you need to do is turn off the filters that usually prevent you from seeing them  The most powerful is simply taking the current state of the world for granted  Even the most radically open minded of us mostly do that  You couldn t get from your bed to the front door if you stopped to question everything     But if you re looking for startup ideas you can sacrifice some of the efficiency of taking the status quo for granted and start to question things  Why is your inbox overflowing  Because you get a lot of email  or because it s hard to get email out of your inbox  Why do you get so much email  What problems are people trying to solve by sending you email  Are there better ways to solve them  And why is it hard to get emails out of your inbox  Why do you keep emails around after you ve read them  Is an inbox the optimal tool for that     Pay particular attention to things that chafe you  The advantage of taking the status quo for granted is not just that it makes life  locally  more efficient  but also that it makes life more tolerable  If you knew about all the things we ll get in the next 50 years but don t have yet  you d find present day life pretty constraining  just as someone from the present would if they were sent back 50 years in a time machine  When something annoys you  it could be because you re living in the future     When you find the right sort of problem  you should probably be able to describe it as obvious  at least to you  When we started Viaweb  all the online stores were built by hand  by web designers making individual HTML pages  It was obvious to us as programmers that these sites would have to be generated by software    5      Which means  strangely enough  that coming up with startup ideas is a question of seeing the obvious  That suggests how weird this process is  you re trying to see things that are obvious  and yet that you hadn t seen     Since what you need to do here is loosen up your own mind  it may be best not to make too much of a direct frontal attack on the problem i e  to sit down and try to think of ideas  The best plan may be just to keep a background process running  looking for things that seem to be missing  Work on hard problems  driven mainly by curiosity  but have a second self watching over your shoulder  taking note of gaps and anomalies    6      Give yourself some time  You have a lot of control over the rate at which you turn yours into a prepared mind  but you have less control over the stimuli that spark ideas when they hit it  If Bill Gates and Paul Allen had constrained themselves to come up with a startup idea in one month  what if they d chosen a month before the Altair appeared  They probably would have worked on a less promising idea  Drew Houston did work on a less promising idea before Dropbox  an SAT prep startup  But Dropbox was a much better idea  both in the absolute sense and also as a match for his skills    7      A good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work on projects that seem like they d be cool  If you do that  you ll naturally tend to build things that are missing  It wouldn t seem as interesting to build something that already existed     Just as trying to think up startup ideas tends to produce bad ones  working on things that could be dismissed as  toys  often produces good ones  When something is described as a toy  that means it has everything an idea needs except being important  It s cool  users love it  it just doesn t matter  But if you re living in the future and you build something cool that users love  it may matter more than outsiders think  Microcomputers seemed like toys when Apple and Microsoft started working on them  I m old enough to remember that era  the usual term for people with their own microcomputers was  hobbyists   BackRub seemed like an inconsequential science project  The Facebook was just a way for undergrads to stalk one another     At YC we re excited when we meet startups working on things that we could imagine know it alls on forums dismissing as toys  To us that s positive evidence an idea is good     If you can afford to take a long view  and arguably you can t afford not to   you can turn  Live in the future and build what s missing  into something even better  Live in the future and build what seems interesting     School    That s what I d advise college students to do  rather than trying to learn about  entrepreneurship    Entrepreneurship  is something you learn best by doing it  The examples of the most successful founders make that clear  What you should be spending your time on in college is ratcheting yourself into the future  College is an incomparable opportunity to do that  What a waste to sacrifice an opportunity to solve the hard part of starting a startup becoming the sort of person who can have organic startup ideas by spending time learning about the easy part  Especially since you won t even really learn about it  any more than you d learn about sex in a class  All you ll learn is the words for things     The clash of domains is a particularly fruitful source of ideas  If you know a lot about programming and you start learning about some other field  you ll probably see problems that software could solve  In fact  you re doubly likely to find good problems in another domain   a  the inhabitants of that domain are not as likely as software people to have already solved their problems with software  and  b  since you come into the new domain totally ignorant  you don t even know what the status quo is to take it for granted     So if you re a CS major and you want to start a startup  instead of taking a class on entrepreneurship you re better off taking a class on  say  genetics  Or better still  go work for a biotech company  CS majors normally get summer jobs at computer hardware or software companies  But if you want to find startup ideas  you might do better to get a summer job in some unrelated field    8      Or don t take any extra classes  and just build things  It s no coincidence that Microsoft and Facebook both got started in January  At Harvard that is  or was  Reading Period  when students have no classes to attend because they re supposed to be studying for finals    9      But don t feel like you have to build things that will become startups  That s premature optimization  Just build things  Preferably with other students  It s not just the classes that make a university such a good place to crank oneself into the future  You re also surrounded by other people trying to do the same thing  If you work together with them on projects  you ll end up producing not just organic ideas  but organic ideas with organic founding teams and that  empirically  is the best combination     Beware of research  If an undergrad writes something all his friends start using  it s quite likely to represent a good startup idea  Whereas a PhD dissertation is extremely unlikely to  For some reason  the more a project has to count as research  the less likely it is to be something that could be turned into a startup    10   I think the reason is that the subset of ideas that count as research is so narrow that it s unlikely that a project that satisfied that constraint would also satisfy the orthogonal constraint of solving users  problems  Whereas when students  or professors  build something as a side project  they automatically gravitate toward solving users  problems perhaps even with an additional energy that comes from being freed from the constraints of research     Competition    Because a good idea should seem obvious  when you have one you ll tend to feel that you re late  Don t let that deter you  Worrying that you re late is one of the signs of a good idea  Ten minutes of searching the web will usually settle the question  Even if you find someone else working on the same thing  you re probably not too late  It s exceptionally rare for startups to be killed by competitors so rare that you can almost discount the possibility  So unless you discover a competitor with the sort of lock in that would prevent users from choosing you  don t discard the idea     If you re uncertain  ask users  The question of whether you re too late is subsumed by the question of whether anyone urgently needs what you plan to make  If you have something that no competitor does and that some subset of users urgently need  you have a beachhead    11      The question then is whether that beachhead is big enough  Or more importantly  who s in it  if the beachhead consists of people doing something lots more people will be doing in the future  then it s probably big enough no matter how small it is  For example  if you re building something differentiated from competitors by the fact that it works on phones  but it only works on the newest phones  that s probably a big enough beachhead     Err on the side of doing things where you ll face competitors  Inexperienced founders usually give competitors more credit than they deserve  Whether you succeed depends far more on you than on your competitors  So better a good idea with competitors than a bad one without     You don t need to worry about entering a  crowded market  so long as you have a thesis about what everyone else in it is overlooking  In fact that s a very promising starting point  Google was that type of idea  Your thesis has to be more precise than  we re going to make an x that doesn t suck  though  You have to be able to phrase it in terms of something the incumbents are overlooking  Best of all is when you can say that they didn t have the courage of their convictions  and that your plan is what they d have done if they d followed through on their own insights  Google was that type of idea too  The search engines that preceded them shied away from the most radical implications of what they were doing particularly that the better a job they did  the faster users would leave     A crowded market is actually a good sign  because it means both that there s demand and that none of the existing solutions are good enough  A startup can t hope to enter a market that s obviously big and yet in which they have no competitors  So any startup that succeeds is either going to be entering a market with existing competitors  but armed with some secret weapon that will get them all the users  like Google   or entering a market that looks small but which will turn out to be big  like Microsoft     12      Filters    There are two more filters you ll need to turn off if you want to notice startup ideas  the unsexy filter and the schlep filter     Most programmers wish they could start a startup by just writing some brilliant code  pushing it to a server  and having users pay them lots of money  They d prefer not to deal with tedious problems or get involved in messy ways with the real world  Which is a reasonable preference  because such things slow you down  But this preference is so widespread that the space of convenient startup ideas has been stripped pretty clean  If you let your mind wander a few blocks down the street to the messy  tedious ideas  you ll find valuable ones just sitting there waiting to be implemented     The schlep filter is so dangerous that I wrote a separate essay about the condition it induces  which I called schlep blindness  I gave Stripe as an example of a startup that benefited from turning off this filter  and a pretty striking example it is  Thousands of programmers were in a position to see this idea  thousands of programmers knew how painful it was to process payments before Stripe  But when they looked for startup ideas they didn t see this one  because unconsciously they shrank from having to deal with payments  And dealing with payments is a schlep for Stripe  but not an intolerable one  In fact they might have had net less pain  because the fear of dealing with payments kept most people away from this idea  Stripe has had comparatively smooth sailing in other areas that are sometimes painful  like user acquisition  They didn t have to try very hard to make themselves heard by users  because users were desperately waiting for what they were building     The unsexy filter is similar to the schlep filter  except it keeps you from working on problems you despise rather than ones you fear  We overcame this one to work on Viaweb  There were interesting things about the architecture of our software  but we weren t interested in ecommerce per se  We could see the problem was one that needed to be solved though     Turning off the schlep filter is more important than turning off the unsexy filter  because the schlep filter is more likely to be an illusion  And even to the degree it isn t  it s a worse form of self indulgence  Starting a successful startup is going to be fairly laborious no matter what  Even if the product doesn t entail a lot of schleps  you ll still have plenty dealing with investors  hiring and firing people  and so on  So if there s some idea you think would be cool but you re kept away from by fear of the schleps involved  don t worry  any sufficiently good idea will have as many     The unsexy filter  while still a source of error  is not as entirely useless as the schlep filter  If you re at the leading edge of a field that s changing rapidly  your ideas about what s sexy will be somewhat correlated with what s valuable in practice  Particularly as you get older and more experienced  Plus if you find an idea sexy  you ll work on it more enthusiastically    13      Recipes    While the best way to discover startup ideas is to become the sort of person who has them and then build whatever interests you  sometimes you don t have that luxury  Sometimes you need an idea now  For example  if you re working on a startup and your initial idea turns out to be bad     For the rest of this essay I ll talk about tricks for coming up with startup ideas on demand  Although empirically you re better off using the organic strategy  you could succeed this way  You just have to be more disciplined  When you use the organic method  you don t even notice an idea unless it s evidence that something is truly missing  But when you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas  you have to replace this natural constraint with self discipline  You ll see a lot more ideas  most of them bad  so you need to be able to filter them     One of the biggest dangers of not using the organic method is the example of the organic method  Organic ideas feel like inspirations  There are a lot of stories about successful startups that began when the founders had what seemed a crazy idea but  just knew  it was promising  When you feel that about an idea you ve had while trying to come up with startup ideas  you re probably mistaken     When searching for ideas  look in areas where you have some expertise  If you re a database expert  don t build a chat app for teenagers  unless you re also a teenager   Maybe it s a good idea  but you can t trust your judgment about that  so ignore it  There have to be other ideas that involve databases  and whose quality you can judge  Do you find it hard to come up with good ideas involving databases  That s because your expertise raises your standards  Your ideas about chat apps are just as bad  but you re giving yourself a Dunning Kruger pass in that domain     The place to start looking for ideas is things you need  There must be things you need    14      One good trick is to ask yourself whether in your previous job you ever found yourself saying  Why doesn t someone make x  If someone made x we d buy it in a second   If you can think of any x people said that about  you probably have an idea  You know there s demand  and people don t say that about things that are impossible to build     More generally  try asking yourself whether there s something unusual about you that makes your needs different from most other people s  You re probably not the only one  It s especially good if you re different in a way people will increasingly be     If you re changing ideas  one unusual thing about you is the idea you d previously been working on  Did you discover any needs while working on it  Several well known startups began this way  Hotmail began as something its founders wrote to talk about their previous startup idea while they were working at their day jobs    15      A particularly promising way to be unusual is to be young  Some of the most valuable new ideas take root first among people in their teens and early twenties  And while young founders are at a disadvantage in some respects  they re the only ones who really understand their peers  It would have been very hard for someone who wasn t a college student to start Facebook  So if you re a young founder  under 23 say   are there things you and your friends would like to do that current technology won t let you     The next best thing to an unmet need of your own is an unmet need of someone else  Try talking to everyone you can about the gaps they find in the world  What s missing  What would they like to do that they can t  What s tedious or annoying  particularly in their work  Let the conversation get general  don t be trying too hard to find startup ideas  You re just looking for something to spark a thought  Maybe you ll notice a problem they didn t consciously realize they had  because you know how to solve it     When you find an unmet need that isn t your own  it may be somewhat blurry at first  The person who needs something may not know exactly what they need  In that case I often recommend that founders act like consultants that they do what they d do if they d been retained to solve the problems of this one user  People s problems are similar enough that nearly all the code you write this way will be reusable  and whatever isn t will be a small price to start out certain that you ve reached the bottom of the well    16      One way to ensure you do a good job solving other people s problems is to make them your own  When Rajat Suri of E la Carte decided to write software for restaurants  he got a job as a waiter to learn how restaurants worked  That may seem like taking things to extremes  but startups are extreme  We love it when founders do such things     In fact  one strategy I recommend to people who need a new idea is not merely to turn off their schlep and unsexy filters  but to seek out ideas that are unsexy or involve schleps  Don t try to start Twitter  Those ideas are so rare that you can t find them by looking for them  Make something unsexy that people will pay you for     A good trick for bypassing the schlep and to some extent the unsexy filter is to ask what you wish someone else would build  so that you could use it  What would you pay for right now     Since startups often garbage collect broken companies and industries  it can be a good trick to look for those that are dying  or deserve to  and try to imagine what kind of company would profit from their demise  For example  journalism is in free fall at the moment  But there may still be money to be made from something like journalism  What sort of company might cause people in the future to say  this replaced journalism  on some axis     But imagine asking that in the future  not now  When one company or industry replaces another  it usually comes in from the side  So don t look for a replacement for x  look for something that people will later say turned out to be a replacement for x  And be imaginative about the axis along which the replacement occurs  Traditional journalism  for example  is a way for readers to get information and to kill time  a way for writers to make money and to get attention  and a vehicle for several different types of advertising  It could be replaced on any of these axes  it has already started to be on most      When startups consume incumbents  they usually start by serving some small but important market that the big players ignore  It s particularly good if there s an admixture of disdain in the big players  attitude  because that often misleads them  For example  after Steve Wozniak built the computer that became the Apple I  he felt obliged to give his then employer Hewlett Packard the option to produce it  Fortunately for him  they turned it down  and one of the reasons they did was that it used a TV for a monitor  which seemed intolerably d class  to a high end hardware company like HP was at the time    17      Are there groups of scruffy but sophisticated users like the early microcomputer  hobbyists  that are currently being ignored by the big players  A startup with its sights set on bigger things can often capture a small market easily by expending an effort that wouldn t be justified by that market alone     Similarly  since the most successful startups generally ride some wave bigger than themselves  it could be a good trick to look for waves and ask how one could benefit from them  The prices of gene sequencing and 3D printing are both experiencing Moore s Law like declines  What new things will we be able to do in the new world we ll have in a few years  What are we unconsciously ruling out as impossible that will soon be possible     Organic    But talking about looking explicitly for waves makes it clear that such recipes are plan B for getting startup ideas  Looking for waves is essentially a way to simulate the organic method  If you re at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field  you don t have to look for waves  you are the wave     Finding startup ideas is a subtle business  and that s why most people who try fail so miserably  It doesn t work well simply to try to think of startup ideas  If you do that  you get bad ones that sound dangerously plausible  The best approach is more indirect  if you have the right sort of background  good startup ideas will seem obvious to you  But even then  not immediately  It takes time to come across situations where you notice something missing  And often these gaps won t seem to be ideas for companies  just things that would be interesting to build  Which is why it s good to have the time and the inclination to build things just because they re interesting     Live in the future and build what seems interesting  Strange as it sounds  that s the real recipe                 Notes      1   This form of bad idea has been around as long as the web  It was common in the 1990s  except then people who had it used to say they were going to create a portal for x instead of a social network for x  Structurally the idea is stone soup  you post a sign saying  this is the place for people interested in x   and all those people show up and you make money from them  What lures founders into this sort of idea are statistics about the millions of people who might be interested in each type of x  What they forget is that any given person might have 20 affinities by this standard  and no one is going to visit 20 different communities regularly       2   I m not saying  incidentally  that I know for sure a social network for pet owners is a bad idea  I know it s a bad idea the way I know randomly generated DNA would not produce a viable organism  The set of plausible sounding startup ideas is many times larger than the set of good ones  and many of the good ones don t even sound that plausible  So if all you know about a startup idea is that it sounds plausible  you have to assume it s bad       3   More precisely  the users  need has to give them sufficient activation energy to start using whatever you make  which can vary a lot  For example  the activation energy for enterprise software sold through traditional channels is very high  so you d have to be a lot better to get users to switch  Whereas the activation energy required to switch to a new search engine is low  Which in turn is why search engines are so much better than enterprise software       4   This gets harder as you get older  While the space of ideas doesn t have dangerous local maxima  the space of careers does  There are fairly high walls between most of the paths people take through life  and the older you get  the higher the walls become       5   It was also obvious to us that the web was going to be a big deal  Few non programmers grasped that in 1995  but the programmers had seen what GUIs had done for desktop computers       6   Maybe it would work to have this second self keep a journal  and each night to make a brief entry listing the gaps and anomalies you d noticed that day  Not startup ideas  just the raw gaps and anomalies       7   Sam Altman points out that taking time to come up with an idea is not merely a better strategy in an absolute sense  but also like an undervalued stock in that so few founders do it     There s comparatively little competition for the best ideas  because few founders are willing to put in the time required to notice them  Whereas there is a great deal of competition for mediocre ideas  because when people make up startup ideas  they tend to make up the same ones       8   For the computer hardware and software companies  summer jobs are the first phase of the recruiting funnel  But if you re good you can skip the first phase  If you re good you ll have no trouble getting hired by these companies when you graduate  regardless of how you spent your summers       9   The empirical evidence suggests that if colleges want to help their students start startups  the best thing they can do is leave them alone in the right way       10   I m speaking here of IT startups  in biotech things are different       11   This is an instance of a more general rule  focus on users  not competitors  The most important information about competitors is what you learn via users anyway       12   In practice most successful startups have elements of both  And you can describe each strategy in terms of the other by adjusting the boundaries of what you call the market  But it s useful to consider these two ideas separately       13   I almost hesitate to raise that point though  Startups are businesses  the point of a business is to make money  and with that additional constraint  you can t expect you ll be able to spend all your time working on what interests you most       14   The need has to be a strong one  You can retroactively describe any made up idea as something you need  But do you really need that recipe site or local event aggregator as much as Drew Houston needed Dropbox  or Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia needed Airbnb     Quite often at YC I find myself asking founders  Would you use this thing yourself  if you hadn t written it   and you d be surprised how often the answer is no       15   Paul Buchheit points out that trying to sell something bad can be a source of better ideas      The best technique I ve found for dealing with YC companies that have bad ideas is to tell them to go sell the product ASAP  before wasting time building it   Not only do they learn that nobody wants what they are building  they very often come back with a real idea that they discovered in the process of trying to sell the bad idea        16   Here s a recipe that might produce the next Facebook  if you re college students  If you have a connection to one of the more powerful sororities at your school  approach the queen bees thereof and offer to be their personal IT consultants  building anything they could imagine needing in their social lives that didn t already exist  Anything that got built this way would be very promising  because such users are not just the most demanding but also the perfect point to spread from     I have no idea whether this would work       17   And the reason it used a TV for a monitor is that Steve Wozniak started out by solving his own problems  He  like most of his peers  couldn t afford a monitor         Thanks to Sam Altman  Mike Arrington

619,training-dataset/business/431.txt,business,Don t Make This Mistake When Pivoting Your StartupMany entrepreneurs often pivot on their startups  trying out a slew of ideas in order to find out one that sticks and can take off  However  it is not always good to pivot  especially regarding the purpose of the startup  In this post  Adeo Ressi explains why this is so  and how entrepreneurs can decide whether to pivot or not   Adeo Ressi is the co founder and CEO of TheFunded and The Founder Institute   The article  Too Many Founders  Pivot  on the Purpose of Their Startup  originally appeared on Adeo s LinkedIn  It has been republished below with permission  The Lean Startup movement has inarguably changed the global startup landscape over the last few years  providing a simple methodology for resource and time constrained companies to quickly learn from their customers  iterate their product development  and ultimately create products that people want   However  in practice  some teachings of the lean startup are easily misinterpreted  leading many startup founders to  pivot  too quickly  too drastically  or without proper validation  or invalidation    As Eric Ries states   a pivot is a change in strategy  not vision   Unfortunately  this is definitely not how I see the lean startup practiced by many founders across the globe today     Recently  we interviewed several Founder Institute Graduate companies that were dead or hibernating  and a common theme we identified with these founders was a lack of passion for the problem their product was solving  These founders had either  1  pursued solving a problem they were not passionate about from the beginning  or  2  pivoted so many times that before they knew it  they were building a product that didn t fit their original vision for the company   So how do you solve this problem  How can you ensure that a Founder has passion and a strong vision for their company  but can also properly interpret the data and feedback they re receiving to correctly make the decision to pivot or persevere   In my experience at the Founder Institute  the best way to do this is to ensure two things in the early stages of any company   The Founder needs to be properly testing their riskiest assumptions  with well designed and executed tests  The Founder needs to have a GREAT answer to the question   why are you building this company    I recently wrote an article in Forbes on the  why are you building this company  question  because it is my favorite question to ask an early stage entrepreneur  As I like to say  if you don t have a good reason  why  you are building a company  you will never have a good  what    For a Founder to have a GREAT answer to this question  their  why  needs to be formed from the intersection of a customer problem and their personal strengths and passions  If a Founder can t align these elements  then their business does not have a high chance of succeeding   In the end  a founder needs to conduct effective tests  and balance feedback from customers with their original passion and vision for the business  A  pivot  should not change your vision for the company  and in many cases  it is  in fact  better to  persevere  than to  pivot    At the last Startup Festival in Montreal  a GREAT conference BTW   I gave a keynote on the topic  which you can watch below   P S  If you are passionate about helping founders build enduring companies that are aligned with their passion and vision  then please join us at the Founder Institute as a Local Leader  http   fi co lead,"[619 1203 626 1172 377 122 603 1076 53 30 133]"

a considerable gamble  As stated in the comic  you ll put your time  money  pride  and comfort all up to bet  You may or may not win during the first round  but the term  Serial Entrepreneur  wasn t coined out of mere fashion  There is a countless number of entrepreneurs who ve failed multiple times in efforts of launching the first  second and even third venture   To fail as an entrepreneur is a rite of passage  It doesn t matter how many times you fail either  because you ll be learning invaluable lessons along the way  Never be afraid to be  all in   Bet on yourself  You ll be surprised to find out how much you can gain from losing  To help you start thinking like an entrepreneur  we compiled three traits every entrepreneur should have   Be resilient  Successful entrepreneurs are able to storm through obstacles  quickly discovering solutions  A founder must execute at light speed   being a first mover and continually exceeding the efforts of your competitors   Be confident  A healthy sense of confidence will increase your chance of success  You will face villainous naysayers that will tear down everything you propose  Make sure your product is what the world needs  and you re the right one to deliver  Be innovative  An open mind equals creativity  and as an entrepreneur you ll need be continuously looking for fresh methods  strategies  and ideas to achieve greatness  Keep an open mind for developing brand new ideas and processes   Turning your project into a business idea  I m sure you ve been there  in the middle of a boring event  steamy shower  or traffic jam  when BAM  you re blindsided with the  the best idea you ve ever had   You can t believe  you re the first person  to devise such a brilliant solution to a  worldwide problem   At first  you re hesitant to share the  genius idea   but your excitement doesn t allow you to hold your tongue for long  This is when reality sets in   Co workers and friends either dismiss or tear apart your idea  naming five different copycat companies  Mentors ridicule the imaginary market you claim is in need of your product  Family members pester you with questions on how you will raise funding  All at once your bubble ruptures  but you mustn t give up  If you ve failed at thoroughly researching your idea  competition  and market  use the strategy below to help construct a concrete idea   Attend networking startup  entrepreneur  and business related events with people who are working on similar projects  and connect with more mentors or business advisors  Analyze your market and competition  Are the trends favoring your idea  Are you violating any agreements  trademarks or patents  Research why companies in your industry have failed  Figure out what they did wrong  and how you can do better  Speak to the founder on the phone and collect their feedback on the market and your idea  Find some real potential customers for your product  and take them out to coffee  Do they immediately understand your idea  Does your idea solve a crucial problem for them  or is it just a  nice to have   Would they pay for it  Create a simple one minute pitch and get feedback from friends and colleagues who will be honest with you   Let s try this again  Startup ideas   Doing research on a not so good idea is one thing  but spending 33 280 hours of your life working on a bad startup idea is another  Dave Parker  Co Founder and CEO of Bundled com claims   First timers have difficulty judging the validity of their ideas  and often get stuck in small ideas  or ideas that generally suck  Nevertheless  because we as founders are so close to our own ideas  it is very difficult to judge them with objectivity   He advises founders to validate their idea by securing answers for these four questions   Is it a scalable or a lifestyle business   Lifestyle businesses are typically service companies  vs  product companies   where with every new customer you need to add staff to deliver the product  A scalable business  on the other hand  is a business that can make money while you sleep   Figure out which category you fall under  Is it a big market   Is the market you are pursuing a big market or a small market  For example  if your idea becomes a company and dominates the market  is it a billion dollar idea  On the other hand  you can run a  successful  small business and fill a specific niche  but it just depends on how you define success and what your goals are   Who exactly is the competition   If your initial answer is that there isn t any competition  that s a problem  This is typical when your idea is too small or squishy  it s not well defined enough  and you simply haven t identified the market   Is this idea worth 80 hours a week for the next 8 years of your life   80 hours per week X 8 Years   33 280 Hours  If you are going to spend that much time on your idea be critical of it now  not after two years of working on the idea    Passion for your startup  Your business is a reflection of who you are  In the words of Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos   Your brand is what people say about you when you re not in the room    Are you launching a diabetes app because you ve lost a family member to the illness  Are you creating an in home care device  because your grandmother lives alone  You should be able to tell a personal story every time you pitch your idea  The foundation of your business is tied to your strengths  dreams  and passions  something no one can supplement  As Adeo sometimes says   people can copy your idea  but nobody can steal your dream    In the video series   How to Build the Foundation for Your Startup   Marcos Polanco  Director of the Silicon Valley Founder Institute  challenges founders to visualize themselves running a business until their last days on earth   For a moment picture that you are are 92 or even 102  The undertaker is about to come  What are you going to tell him  If you plead for more time to manage your company  then you know that you re pursuing your passion    Every time you pitch your idea  remember to sell your passion rather than the product  If you successfully attract people to your startup s vision  there will be no need for  sales   Below are four tips to help you tie passion to your business   Declare your startup s core purpose   Construct a strategy to achieve this purpose   Share your vision with your targeted audience   Generate sales through your vision  not your product   Don t harp over business plans  Startup founders are beginning to put more of an emphasis on pitch  and less on business plans  Many say that venture capitalists don t even read business plans anymore  and that they re becoming a waste of time  Others claim that business plans are an essential key to success and shouldn t be neglected  Whether who s right or wrong  LivePlan CEO Sabrina Parsons  created a pitch template combining all the important details usually featured in a business plan  Your pitch would presumably need to talk about   Your special sauce  Why your product or service is what this world needs   Your team  Why you are the ones to make this happen   The

get for giving you their money   A day in the life as an entrepreneur  In the beginning of entrepreneurship  you re pretty much obligated to do everything  even if that means running around frantically like a monkey  Once you ve formulated a well researched and tested plan  you can begin to outsource and develop a small team  From co founders to CEOs  you will start depending on people to complete certain tasks  However  there will be duties you won t be able to hand over as easily during the early stages of business  These tasks will fog your brain  forcing you to think of solutions and strategies each day   Fundraising  Adeo Ressi quotes   you re going to be raising money all the time  so the person that s doing the fundraising needs to be the CEO  You can t rely on 3rd party people to do the fundraising for you    Traction  Benjamin Chong   a partner at Right Click Capital and a Co Director of the Sydney Founder Institute claims   a startup with little to no traction will not pique the interest of investors  Make sure you are establishing a solid customer base and gaining traction over time  This will help investors determine if your startup is viable    Hiring  Scott Heiferman  Co Founder and CEO of Meetup com quotes   You need a team that s going to care about this thing as much as you do   Your team will be a reflection of who you and your company   In Bradley Joyce s  CEO  Socialyzer  5 Things I Learned as an Entrepreneur This Year  he illustrates the importance of having personal support as an early stage entrepreneur   This year has been filled with massive amounts of stress for me  There have been moments where I ve been extremely depressed and close to throwing in the towel  The only reason I ve survived is because I have amazing people in my life that let me vent and complain but still know I love what I do and encourage me to persevere  If you can t name who that person is for you in a split second  you need to start searching  Fast  I ll be making changes in my own life so I can be closer to these people    Do you need a co founder   There s been much debate over whether companies should derive from both founder and co founder  Some think that running a business alone is too much work  while others believe it s more possible than ever before  for one person to lead a company  Geoff Lewis  CEO of TopGuest claims   I m seeing it done first hand by some of my single founder friends  each of whom I believe will be wildly successful  In lieu of co founders  these folks are instead assembling strong teams of employees  often in  co founder like  roles  after having established their companies    A co founder will do half the work for you  provide emotional support  and have a huge impact on the startup s culture  With a more diverse skill set  co founders can fill in the gaps you can t and contribute more of their own money to the business  Naval Ravikant  Co founder of Angelist  defines the ideal

710,training-dataset/business/86.txt,business,Why not to do a startupThe Pmarca Guide to Startups   Part 1  Why not to do a startup  In this series of posts I will walk through some of my accumulated knowledge and experience in building high tech startups   My specific experience is from three companies I have co founded  Netscape  sold to America Online in 1998 for  4 2 billion  Opsware  formerly Loudcloud   a public software company with an approximately  1 billion market cap  and now Ning  a new  private consumer Internet company   But more generally  I ve been fortunate enough to be involved in and exposed to a broad range of other startups    maybe 40 or 50 in enough detail to know what I m talking about    since arriving in Silicon Valley in 1994  as a board member  as an angel investor  as an advisor  as a friend of various founders  and as a participant in various venture capital funds   This series will focus on lessons learned from this entire cross section of Silicon Valley startups    so don t think that anything I am talking about is referring to one of my own companies  most likely when I talk about a scenario I have seen or something I have experienced  it is from some other startup that I am not naming but was involved with some other way than as a founder   Finally  much of my perspective is based on Silicon Valley and the environment that we have here    the culture  the people  the venture capital base  and so on  Some of it will travel well to other regions and countries  some probably will not  Caveat emptor   With all that out of the way  let s start at the beginning  why not to do a startup   Startups  even in the wake of the crash of 2000  have become imbued with a real mystique    you read a lot about how great it is to do a startup  how much fun it is  what with the getting to invent the future  all the free meals  foosball tables  and all the rest   Now  it is true that there are a lot of great things about doing a startup  They include  in my experience   Most fundamentally  the opportunity to be in control of your own destiny    you get to succeed or fail on your own  and you don t have some bozo telling you what to do  For a certain kind of personality  this alone is reason enough to do a startup   The opportunity to create something new    the proverbial blank sheet of paper  You have the ability    actually  the obligation    to imagine a product that does not yet exist and bring it into existence  without any of the constraints normally faced by larger companies   The opportunity to have an impact on the world    to give people a new way to communicate  a new way to share information  a new way to work together  or anything else you can think of that would make the world a better place  Think it should be easier for low income people to borrow money  Start Prosper  Think television should be opened up to an infinite number of channels  Start Joost  Think that computers should be based on Unix and open standards and not proprietary technology  Start Sun   The ability to create your ideal culture and work with a dream team of people you get to assemble yourself  Want your culture to be based on people who have fun every day and enjoy working together  Or  are hyper competitive both in work and play  Or  are super focused on creating innovative new rocket science technologies  Or  are global in perspective from day one  You get to choose  and to build your culture and team to suit   And finally  money    startups done right can of course be highly lucrative  This is not just an issue of personal greed    when things go right  your team and employees will themselves do very well and will be able to support their families  send their kids to college  and realize their dreams  and that s really cool  And if you re really lucky  you as the entrepreneur can ultimately make profound philanthropic gifts that change society for the better   However  there are many more reasons to not do a startup   First  and most importantly  realize that a startup puts you on an emotional rollercoaster unlike anything you have ever experienced   You will flip rapidly from a day in which you are euphorically convinced you are going to own the world  to a day in which doom seems only weeks away and you feel completely ruined  and back again   Over and over and over   And I m talking about what happens to stable entrepreneurs   There is so much uncertainty and so much risk around practically everything you are doing  Will the product ship on time  Will it be fast enough  Will it have too many bugs  Will it be easy to use  Will anyone use it  Will your competitor beat you to market  Will you get any press coverage  Will anyone invest in the company  Will that key new engineer join  Will your key user interface designer quit and go to Google  And on and on and on     Some days things will go really well and some things will go really poorly  And the level of stress that you re under generally will magnify those transient data points into incredible highs and unbelievable lows at whiplash speed and huge magnitude   Sound like fun   Second  in a startup  absolutely nothing happens unless you make it happen   This one throws both founders and employees new to startups   In an established company    no matter how poorly run or demoralized    things happen  They just happen  People come in to work  Code gets written  User interfaces get designed  Servers get provisioned  Markets get analyzed  Pricing gets studied and determined  Sales calls get made  The wastebaskets get emptied  And so on   A startup has none of the established systems  rhythms  infrastructure that any established company has   In a startup it is very easy for the code to not get written  for the user interfaces to not get designed    for people to not come into work    and for the wastebaskets to not get emptied   You as the founder have to put all of these systems and routines and habits in place and get everyone actually rowing    forget even about rowing in the right direction  just rowing at all is hard enough at the start   And until you do  absolutely nothing happens   Unless  of course  you do it yourself   Have fun emptying those wastebaskets   Third  you get told no    a lot   Unless you ve spent time in sales  you are probably not familiar with being told no a lot   It s not so much fun   Go watch Death of a Salesman and then Glengarry Glen Ross   That s roughly what it s like   You re going to get told no by potential employees  potential investors  potential customers  potential partners  reporters  analysts     Over and over and over   And when you do get a  yes   half the time you ll get a call two days later and it ll turn out the answer has morphed into  no    Better start working on your fake smile   Fourth  hiring is a huge pain in the ass   You will be amazed how many windowshoppers you ll deal with   A lot of people think they want to be part of a startup  but when the time comes to leave their cushy job at HP or Apple  they flinch    and stay   Going through the recruiting process and being seduced by a startup is heady stuff for your typical engineer or midlevel manager at a big company    you get to participate vicariously in the thrill of a startup without actually having to join or do any of the hard work   As a founder of a startup trying to hire your team  you ll run into this again and again   When Jim Clark decided to start a new company in 1994  I was one of about a dozen people at various Silicon Valley companies he was talking to about joining him in what became Netscape   I was the only one who went all the way to saying  yes   largely because I was 22 and had no reason not to do it    The rest flinched and didn t do it   And this was Jim Clark  a legend in the industry who was coming off of the most successful company in Silicon Valley in 1994    Silicon Graphics Inc   How easy do you think it s going to be for you   Then  once you do get through the windowshoppers and actually hire some people  your success rate on hiring is probably not going to be higher than 50   and that s if you re good at it   By that I mean that half or more of the people you hire aren t going to work out  They re going to be too lazy  too slow  easily rattled  political  bipolar  or psychotic   And then you have to either live with them  or fire them   Which ones of those sounds like fun   Fifth  God help you  at some point you re going to have to hire executives   You think hiring employees is hard and risky    wait until you start hiring for VP Engineering  VP Marketing  VP Sales  VP HR  General Counsel  and CFO   Sixth  the hours   There s been a lot of talk in Silicon Valley lately about work life balance    about how you should be able to do a startup and simultaneously live a full and fulfilling outside life   Now  personally  I have a lot of sympathy for that point of view   And I try hard in my companies  well  at least my last two companies  to do whatever I can to help make sure that people aren t ground down to little tiny spots on the floor by the workload and the hours   But  it s really difficult   The fact is that startups are incredibly intense experiences and take a lot out of people in the best of circumstances   And just because you want people to have work life balance  it s not so easy when you re close to running out of cash  your product hasn t shipped yet  your VC is mad at you  and your Kleiner Perkins backed competitor in Menlo Park    you know  the one whose employees  average age seems to be about 19    is kicking your butt   Which is what it s going to be like most of the time   And even if you can help your employees have proper work life balance  as a founder you certainly won t    In case you were wondering  by the way  the hours do compound the stress    Seventh  it s really easy for the culture of a startup to go sideways   This combines the first and second items above   This is the emotional rollercoaster wreaking havoc on not just you but your whole company   It takes time for the culture of any company to become  set     for the team of people who have come together for the first time to decide collectively what they re all about  what they value    and how they look at challenge and adversity   In the best case  you get an amazing dynamic of people really pulling together  supporting one another  and working their collective tails off in pursuit of a dream   In the worst case  you end up with widespread  self reinforcing bitterness  disillusionment  cynicism  bad morale  contempt for management  and depression   And you as the founder have much less influence over this than you ll think you do   Guess which way it usually goes   Eighth  there are lots of X factors that can come along and whup you right upside the head  and there s absolutely nothing you can do about them   Stock market crashes   Terrorist attacks   Natural disasters   A better funded startup with a more experienced team that s been hard at work longer than you have  in stealth mode  that unexpectedly releases a product that swiftly comes to dominate your market  completely closing off your opportunity  and you had no idea they were even working on it   At best  any given X factor might slam shut the fundraising window  cause customers to delay or cancel purchases    or  at worst  shut down your whole company   Russian mobsters laundering millions of dollars of dirty money through your service  resulting in the credit card companies closing you down   You think I m joking about that one   OK  now here s the best part   I haven t even talked about figuring out what product to build  building it  taking it to market  and standing out from the crowd   All the risks in the core activities of what your company actually does are yet to come  and to be discussed in future posts in this series   Closing

life into your startup idea  Everyday  successful companies are revolutionizing every industry you can think of   and industries you didn t even know existed   But  while industry publications glorify the milestones of these innovative startups  they rarely shed light on the actual process of finding a company idea  the creative minutiae of cultivating a trailblazing concept   If you are an entrepreneur that craves a step by step method for developing a cutting edge idea for a startup that will live into posterity  read on as we delineate the best practices of startup ideation   1  Identify a Problem  Just because an idea is unique does not mean it s good  Countless startups have achieved instant success because of a radical  gimmicky offering  and have failed just as quickly when the novelty wore off   Before you begin your search for that gem of a startup idea  start by identifying problems in the industry or industries you re interested in  as the most successful  and lasting companies  are the ones that provide relevant solutions   In the Next Web article  Real innovation is about solving problems  not having ideas   Huge CEO Aaron Shapiro expounds on several different types of general problems that nearly everyone  i e  your potential customers  experiences  and are outlined below   Inconvenience  There will always be ways to make our everyday routines easier  faster  cheaper  funner  safer  etc  which means that there will always be a problem for a startup to solve  As you interact with others  take note of the habitual activities that people often complain about and think about what you can do to reduce their inconvenience   Inefficiency  Countless daily actions can benefit from a streamlined boost  From transportation to finance to health and more  so much money  time  energy  and materials are wasted in completing everyday tasks  Think of all the valuable resources that can be saved if there was a more efficient way of doing things   Inevitability  As the costs of accelerated innovation and consumer adoption decrease  new and better solutions will supersede old and obsolete ones  More and more processes are becoming automated in the workforce  as well as medical  finance  travel  and countless other industries  Think like a technologist and see inevitability as a well of opportunities   Your Own Problems  Chances are that most  if not all  of the problems you encounter on a regular basis are experienced by many others  as well  As you go through your daily routine  think about every challenge you endure  regardless of how big or small it is  and imagine what type of product could alleviate your woes   Become an Expert in Your Industry  By this point  you should have an idea of the types of problems you want to solve  However  you must become an authority in the industry you want to work in  which means devoting hours and hours to extensive market research  At a previous Founder Showcase  Chris Dixon  Investing Partner at Andreessen Horowitz  stresses the importance of  earning  an industry  secret    the one facet to your offering that will set you apart from everyone else   You need to know a secret  The reason why good ideas often look like bad ideas is that the rest of the world doesn t know the secret  You ve got to earn the secret  You generally don t get secrets in this business by stumbling on them  That s not how the real world works  The real world is that you ll spend tens of thousands of hours working on something and you discover a secret    Time Your Ideas  At a previous Founder Showcase  Evernote CEO Phil Libin implored founders to wait until the world changes so that an important problem goes from impossible to just really hard  then execute  While entrepreneurs don t need to wait years and years before bringing their idea to life  Libin recommends testing an idea with the following criteria   Is right now the best time   What is it about my idea that was impossible before   What is it about the world that s changed that s making my idea just possible to execute now   If your idea is not sufficiently important  is it worth working on it   If your idea was not impossible before  then why haven t other people done it   If the idea is no longer impossible  is it too late to work on it   If you want more insights on startup timing  check out the video below with Phil Libin   2  Develop a Solution  After following the advice from the previous section  you should have a fairly long list of problems to peruse through  Take a look at the methods below to help you on the path to solving your chosen problem   Look for Personal Advantages  In an article titled  How to Pick Startup Ideas   RethinkDB cofounder Slava Akhmechet recommends looking within and discovering what makes you properly equipped to solve a given problem  List out the unique traits and perspectives that make you stand out from others  For example  your list could include   Professional experience  Technical expertise  Creative or artistic talents  Hobbies and interests  First hand industry knowledge  When it comes to mining potential startup ideas from everyday problems  Marco Terry s article  How to Come Up With an Awesome Idea for Your Startup  lists out several criteria he uses to test solutions  As you examine each problem on your list  ask yourself the following questions to test its viability   Are You Interested or Passionate About the Problem   If you have no interest in a given problem  why would dedicate several years developing a solution for it  Remember that if your dream is to launch a successful startup  you must be prepared to spend several years of your life  and sacrifice much of your regular work  family  and social life  as well  to get it off the ground   Does the Problem Affect Many People Businesses   Does your perceived problem affect only a small population  If so  then ditch it  unless you don t care about making money  However  as entrepreneurs are inherently capitalists  the problem you intend to solve must affect a sizeable population in order to guarantee any sort of possibility of having a sizeable customer base   The best way to calculate your  Total Addressable Market  size is through a bottom up approach  similar to the example below   Would You Pay to Have This Problem Fixed   This is an important consideration to keep in mind  While there are ostensibly an infinite number of problems that everyone must deal with on a regular basis  some problems just aren t worth paying money for to be solved  Think about whether you would pay for a solution to your problem  If you re not willing to pay  chances are that others aren t either   Can You Improve on Existing Solutions   When you find a problem that you re motivated to solve  explore what solutions may already exist  Conducting research into who your industry rivals are and how effective they are at solving your problem will give you considerable insight into what you need to do to beat the competition   Do you want more startup ideation resources  Check out some of our previous blog posts on the subject   3  Validate Your Idea  Once you ve settled on a potential startup idea  you must validate it and test its viability  You may think that your idea is the best yet conceived  but nearly every entrepreneur thinks the same thing of their initial ideas as well  Before you rush into launching your product  determine its value while you re still in the idea stage to avoid problems later on   if your idea doesn t hold as well as you thought it did by the end of this section  it s not worth your time   In the Beta i article  How do you know if your startup idea is good enough    Maria Almeida examines several methods for analyzing the strengths of a startup idea   Talk to as Many People as Possible  Identify experts in your respective market and get feedback from them  Attend industry events to network with others  Another way to get valuable insights from experienced professionals is to schedule meetings with those who tried to start up in your industry but failed  as they will like share your passion for the problem you re trying to solve   Also  while you re learning directly from founders on why their startups failed  be sure to check out Autopsy  a site that collects stories of startup failure to share lessons learned with the startup community       Learn About Your Potential Customers  You may have identified a pervasive problem that a large demographic experiences  but you still need to determine if it s something that that demographic wants  Ascertain the effectiveness of your offering and learn how others  besides you and your friends and family  as they will be biased  would interact it   To help you make most out of the feedback you receive on your potential offering  we ve provided an Idea Evaluation Worksheet  Complete with relevant criteria and targeted questions with which to interview your prospective users  this guide will aid you in determining whether your idea will resonate with a large audience       Identify Your Competition  Take the time to learn about similar offerings from other companies  Read reviews of their products from their customers and pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses they ve experienced  Then  explore how you can improve on what s out there and how you can develop features that set you above the competition  Make a detailed list that clearly outlines your findings and continuously update it as you home in on and refine your final offering   Below is a Value Proposition Matrix to help you define what makes your company unique  taken from a presentation by Mint com founder  Aaron Patzer  The full presentation   Naming   Branding   can be found here        Final Thoughts  While we cannot guarantee that reading this blog post alone will result in a revolutionary startup idea  hopefully it has stirred your entrepreneurial imagination and opened up new creative avenues for you  As you venture forth on your path to startup success  keep an open mind and continue to experiment with ideas  because you never know where or when that inspirational lightning will strike    You can t crush ideas by suppressing them  You can only crush them by ignoring them     Vachel Lindsay,"[746 611 626 122 147 377 1208 768 53 546 486]"
754,training-dataset/business/1490.txt,business,Before GrowthWe tell startups all the time that they have to grow quickly  That s true  and very good advice  but I think the current fashion of Silicon Valley startups has taken this to an unhealthy extreme startups have a weekly growth goal before they really have any strong idea about what they want to build   In the first few weeks of a startup s life  the founders really need to figure out what they re doing and why  Then they need to build a product some users really love  Only after that they should focus on growth above all else   A startup that prematurely targets a growth goal often ends up making a nebulous product that some users sort of like and papering over this with  growth hacking   That sort of works at least  it will fool investors for awhile until they start digging into retention numbers but eventually the music stops   I think the right initial metric is  do any users love our product so much they spontaneously tell other people to use it   Until that s a  yes   founders are generally better off focusing on this instead of a growth target   The very best technology companies sometimes take awhile to figure out exactly what they re doing  but when they do  they usually pass that binary test before turning all their energy to growth  It s the critical ingredient for companies that do really well  1   and if you don t figure it out  no amount of growth hacking will make you into a great company   As a side note  startups that don t first figure out a product some users love also seem to rarely develop the sense of mission that the best companies have            1  The other thing that these companies have  and that also usually gets figured out early  is some sort of a monopoly,"[754 759 1258 569 491 958 1203 611 1110 710 937]"
759,training-dataset/business/113.txt,business,Startup advice  brieflyThis is a very short summary with lots left out here is the long version  http   startupclass samaltman com        You should start with an idea  not a company  When it s just an idea or project  the stakes are lower and you re more willing to entertain outlandish sounding but potentially huge ideas  The best way to start a company is to build interesting projects   On the other hand  when you have a  company  that you feel pressure to commit to an idea too quickly  If it s just a project  you can spend more time finding something great to work on  which is important if the startup really works  you ll probably be working on it for a very long time   Have at least one technical founder on the team  i e  someone who can build whatever the company is going to build    In general  prefer a fast growing market to a large but slow growing one  especially if you have conviction the fast growing market is going to be important but others dismiss it as unimportant   The best startup ideas are the ones that seem like bad ideas but are good ideas   Make something people want  You can screw up most other things if you get this right  if you don t  nothing else will save you   Once you ve shifted from  interesting project  to  company  mode  be decisive and act quickly  Instead of thinking about making a decision over the course of week  think about making it in an hour  and getting it done in the next hour   Become formidable  Also become tough the road ahead is going to be painful and make you doubt yourself many  many times   Figure out a way to get your product in front of users  Start manually  read this  http   www paulgraham com ds html   Listen to what your users tell you  improve your product  and then listen again  Keep doing this until you ve made something some users love  one of the many brilliant Paul Buchheit observations is that it s better to build something a small number of users love than something a lot of users like   Don t deceive yourself about whether or not your users actually love your product   Keep your burn rate very low until you re sure you ve built something people love  The easiest way to do this is hire slowly   Have a strategy  Most people don t  Occasionally take a little bit of time to think about how you re executing against your strategy  Specifically  remember that someday you need to have a monopoly  in the Peter Thiel sense    Read this before you raise money  http   paulgraham com fr html   Learn to ask for what you want   Ignore what the press says about you  especially if it s complimentary   Generate revenue early in the life of your company   Hire the best people you can  However much time you re spending on this  it s probably not enough  Give a lot of equity to your employees  and have very high expectations  Smart  effective people are critical to success  Read this  http   blog samaltman com how to hire   Fire people quickly when you make hiring mistakes   Don t work with people you don t have a good feeling about this goes for employees  and cofounders   partners  investors  etc   Figure out a way to get users at scale  i e  bite the bullet and learn how sales and marketing work   Incidentally  while it is currently in fashion  spending more than the lifetime value of your users to acquire them is not an acceptable strategy   Obsess about your growth rate  and never stop  The company will build what the CEO measures  If you ever catch yourself saying  we re not really focused on growth right now   think very carefully about the possibility you re focused on the wrong thing  Also  don t let yourself be deceived by vanity metrics   Eventually  the company needs to evolve to become a mission that everyone  but especially the founders  are exceptionally dedicated to  The  missionaries vs  mercenaries  soundbite is overused but true   Don t waste your time on stuff that doesn t matter  i e  things other than building your product  talking to your users  growing  etc    In general  avoid the kind of stuff that might be in a movie about running a startup meeting with lawyers and accountants  going to lots of conferences  grabbing coffee with people  sitting in lots of meetings  etc  Become a Delaware C Corp  use Clerky or any well known Silicon Valley law firm  and then get back to work on your product   Focus intensely on the things that do matter  Every day  figure out what the 2 or 3 most important things for you to do are  Do those and ignore other distractions  Be a relentless execution machine   Do what it takes and don t make up excuses   Learn to manage people  Make sure your employees are happy  Don t ignore this   In addition to building a great product  if you want to be really successful  you also have to build a great company  So think a lot about your culture   Don t underestimate the importance of personal connections   Ignore acquisition interest until you are sure you want to sell  Don t  check the market   There is an alternate universe somewhere full of companies that would have been great if they could have just avoided this one mistake  Unfortunately  in this universe  they re all dead   Work really hard  Everyone wants a secret to success other than this  if it exists  I haven t found it yet   Keep doing this for 10 years,"[759 1258 611 754 569 958 710

816,training-dataset/business/775.txt,business,So you want to work for a startupRecently  I ve chatted with a bunch of designers who ve said they re interested in working for startups  Several have asked me if I have any advice  so I decided to write a quick post about the things I ve learned over the course of my last 9 years in the startup industry   The key to making a successful jump into a startup  first define exactly what it is you value in a workplace   It dawned on me early in my career that I don t love working for startups in general  I love working for my startups because they fit my lifestyle and personality   There are a series of questions you need to ask yourself to know if a particular startup is right for you   1  What is the startup s view on work life balance   I m a mom  and it s important for me to be able to work remotely  either on occasion or full time  Days when my kiddo is running a fever and can t go to school  she can lay on the couch next to my desk sleeping while I work  I don t lose any productivity by having to take a sick day  and my team still meets our deadlines  And we utilize a set of fabulous communication tools like Slack that let us communicate as clearly  or even more clearly  to be honest  as we would in a traditional office  I m fortunate to work for a fully distributed company now that is very family centric   Related  Remote workers share how they manage their work life balance  Other startups require extremely long hours in the office and 100  dedication to the job to the point that there basically isn t room for anything else in your life  Tons of people love and feed off of that intensity   Often times people join a startup expecting scenario A  but instead they wind up in scenario B and feel like they re drowning  Make sure a startup s work life balance is a good fit for your lifestyle and personality before you sign on the dotted line   2  Do they have a benefits package that suits your needs   Some startups invest tons of money in benefits packages to attract talent  others advertise hefty starting salaries with little to no benefits  and still others have no benefits and low salaries  but they offer stock options  The list of scenarios goes on  but what it really comes down to is whether they offer what you need   Then you get the rare few like InVision that offer all of the things  Check out the open positions here    3  Is the company working on something you re passionate about   This is extremely important  When you join a startup  you need to be excited about what you re working on  because things can get crazy  If you re not committed to the product  you ll never make it through the rapid growth stage   When you jump into a startup environment  you re kind of jumping into a casino situation  You re betting your salary that the company is going to take off and soar  Just as it goes with gambling  though  there s a chance that the company is going to flop and more often than not with startups  this is the case   I ve been super fortunate to land in 2 extremely successful startups back to back    Take a hard look at the company  their values  their long term plans  and how passionate their senior leadership and employees are about making magic happen  Then evaluate whether you re passionate enough about the company and the product to take the gamble   4  Does the company have room for career advancement   One of the coolest things for me about working for the startups I ve worked for has been the opportunity for cross departmental career advancement  At my last startup we had folks who came into the company as entry level in a department where they fit  only to discover they had serious passion for another area of the company  They didn t need to quit to have the opportunity to advance their careers in that totally different direction because the company did a ton of hiring and promotion from within   When you join some startups in the early stages  you end up wearing tons of hats  Be prepared to do all kinds of things that  aren t in your job description   The neat thing about those environments is that once the company starts to grow  you can sometimes work with the senior staff to carve your own niche and focus on the portions of the job you enjoyed most  but that s not always the case    There are other startups that take a  once you re in a position  you re stuck there  approach and they hire externally for the most part  Think about your career goals  and look into the ability to move within the organization you re considering to make sure you re aligned in those areas   5  Do these people seem like folks you d enjoy spending time with feel inspired by trust with your career and could turn into a work family   Some people are going to read that work family line and think it s lame  But in all seriousness  when you re working at a startup you spend a huge amount of time with a small group of people  While differing opinions are great because they often lead to killer innovation  the ability to get along as a group after sharing those differing opinions is huge   You need folks who are all on the same page and are borderline obsessed with making your company succeed  and who are willing to do whatever needs to be done in order to make that dream happen  Being able to collaborate doesn t mean being similar  or all thinking the same way  your life would be horribly boring  as would your products  if your whole team were made up of clones of you  it just means being able to communicate in a productive way in a fast paced  intense environment  Make sure the team you re interviewing with feels like a good culture fit for you before you dive in   If you re aligned on all of these points and decide to go for it  get ready for an incredibly exciting roller coaster ride that may lead to dreams becoming reality   Or the ride may fly off the track and crash and burn  But that s the fun in working for a startup  right  The excitement is in the gamble   Read more from Jennifer Aldrich,"[816 710 486 626 759 122 1208 611 1258 603 569]"

his exclusive insights about what every startup should strive for when pitching their companies and applying to accelerators  Even if you re not pitching your company on a regular basis or have no plans of applying to an accelerator  the wisdom found in this article is bound to apply to your company   The post   18 Lessons for Entrepreneurs from 300  Startup Accelerator Applications   originally appeared on Startup88  It has been republished below with permission    I launch startups and develop inventions for a living and mentor a lot of entrepreneurs in my spare time   In the last 6 months  I reviewed accelerator applications for muru D  CSIRO Accelerator  Australian Government funded Scientific   Industrial Research organisation  5000  scientists  and Incubate org   In addition I get over 100 pitches a month on my tech blog Startup88 com and I also reviewed over 500 inventions in the last 3 years in my day job  so I get to see a lot of ideas and startups and repeatedly see the same patterns   Here are the takeaways for entrepreneurs from the 300  applications I reviewed recently   1  You must have the accelerator smashed into the floor  Most startups I see are not operating at full throttle   2  Traction and growth beats everything else  If you have traction you can get away with anything  Crappy looking business plan  no idea how to make money  team with no track record  all can be forgiven in the presence of a user base who has adopted the product and is really using it  paying users are even better   3  If you have major traction  proprietary technology or amazing test results please don t hide them in the back of your pitch  or as they say in newspapers  don t bury the lede  it needs to be at the very front of application   This happened numerous times  I was amazed to find a really compelling test result on page 19 of 28 page pitch deck    4  Don t have a 28 page pitch deck   5  You are probably kidding yourself if you think you can raise money or get accepted to a decent incubator or accelerator without an MVP  preferably with users  the competition is just too fierce  The following exceptions might apply  amazing proprietary technology that has come out of lab or entrepreneurs with a track record   6  At some point you need to decide that your startup is open for business  Until then its all theory and assumptions and both are probably wrong to some extent  The sooner this happens and you start learning from someone who matters the better chance you have of being successful   7  Demonstrating you have learnt from your initial user actions and experiments and adapted is important  The last thing an accelerator wants is a startup that won t experiment  learn and adapt  examples where you have used customer feedback data to improve are influential   8  Spend much more time on user acquisition  Remember this   Many teams can build a product   Some teams can get product market fit   Very few teams can work out how to acquire enough customers to breakeven and company failure is almost always because of lack of customers and cash not product   9  If you can t convince me you are solving a real problem that someone cares about in the first few paragraphs you have lost me   10  If you are just starting to build an  Uber for X or AirBnB for Y  you are 3 years too late  Move on   11  If you are replicating a business model that already has significant funding  Pets  Food Delivery  Uber for X  IOT  Parking  Jobs and you don t have something highly proprietary competitive that solves their problems forget it   12  If you don t have at least one customer acquisition strategy that is working you are toast   13  If you are pitching hardware and you haven t got a sort of working prototype or at least a detailed design its going to be challenging  with the exception of dedicated Hardware incubators like Hax or Bolt but even there the winners will probably have more than a breadboard prototype   14  In larger competitions   100 entries  the judges get fatigued  usually around letter M   you cannot afford to be verbose or vague in the first few sections i e  You must have concise believable answers to the following   What does your startup do   Whose problem do you solve and why do they care   Why do you have an advantage   How will you win   Often there isn t a section that specifically asks about traction  but you should weave this into your answers to the first few questions   15  If you can t come up with a compelling advantage and reasons why you will be successful then you might want to rethink your entry  I saw numerous   10  examples of businesses who answered that their business would be easy to copy or couldn t provide competitive advantages  Seriously WTF   16  If you are at University and building something that specifically targets a problem which exists primarily in the mind of an undergrad  i e  food  transport or study  and there are 10 other startups doing the same thing  on your campus  then find something else to do  its not going to end well   17  If I see another babysitter app  parking app  nightclub booking  drinks ordering app  food delivery to your dorm room app  Im going to scream  Please stop it   18  Many accelerators require full time commitment by all founders for the term of the program  not much point applying if you can t be there for the program   If you are serious about getting into a good accelerator I believe you need to run a few practice attempts  Find last years questions  put together an application  6 months before the competition  when its not crazy  ask one of the mentors or selectors for feedback about your application and your business   In the 6 month lead up to the actual selection process really hammer the testing and customer acquisition and demonstrate to the mentor you have resolved the issues they raised  keep them updated   If the mentor can see you have benefited from their guidance and made progress and you are coachable then they will probably advocate for you   note this might not work for the really large US accelerators but give it a try    Mike

are a multitude of risks that come along with launching a tech startup  When you take your first step on the path of entrepreneurship  not only do you have to invest your own personal funds in the venture  but you must sacrifice your family  social  and work life to build your dream company  This is a lot to put on the line for something that may fail before even getting off the ground   While there is no surefire way to found a successful risk free startup  there are plenty of ways to help you identify and remove many of the risks that face your company  Taken from top industry experts  this blog post is full of startup tips and tricks to help give you peace of mind as you launch your venture   What Are Your Business Assumptions   The first step to identifying and eliminating the risks your startup faces is to lay out your business assumptions  which will serve as the foundation of your business plan  According to Inc com   An assumption is a statement that is presumed to be true without concrete evidence to support it  In the business world  assumptions are used in a wide variety of situations to enable companies to plan and make decisions in the face of uncertainty    While it may be easy to gloss over the importance of carefully listing out your assumptions  taking the time to do so will greatly affect the future of your startup  In the Ivey Business Journal article   Strategic Assumptions  The Essential  and Missing  Element of Your Strategic Plan   Mark Hollingworth posits that assumptions reflect the vision  strategic map  and performance targets of a business  and are vital to the success of your company   Your company s business model should be comprised of nine basic building blocks  which are listed out below   Your Customer Segments  Tabulate all of the people and or organizations for whom you are providing value   Your Value Proposition for each segment  Describe your product and its features that will create value for your customers   The Channels to reach your customers  List out the means by which you interact with and deliver value to your customers   The Customer Relationships you establish  Describe what type of connection or exchange you plan to establish with your customers   The Revenue Streams you generate  Detail how your company will capture value and the pricing methods you will employ   The Key Activities you require to create value  Illustrate the essential actions your company needs to make to perform well   The Key Resources you require to create value  Tabulate the necessary assets for your infrastructure to create  deliver  and capture value   The Key Partnerships   List out who can help you leverage your business model since you most likely do not have easy access to all of your key resources  nor will you be able to perform all of your Key Activities on your own   The Cost Structure of the model  Once you clearly understand your business model s infrastructure  you should then have an idea of its cost structure   Each of these elements must be accounted for  which means that you have to clearly describe your hypothesis  or assumption  for every aspect of your business model which will then be tested later on   To help you organize your business assumptions  here is the Business Model Canvas created by Alex Osterwalder  speaker  author  and co founder of Strategyzer       Rank Your Assumptions  Now that you ve thoroughly organized your business assumptions  you must prioritize them based on their risk factor  In the LeanStack article   How to Identify Your Riskiest Business Model Assumptions   Ash Maurya  author of Running Lean  Iterate from Plan A to a Plan That Works  states that regardless of how amazing your company is  you should continuously strive to eliminate the risks that face your company  If you neglect to take the time to accurately rank your riskiest assumptions  no amount of experimenting and iterating will increase your chances of mitigating the obstacles that face your startup  and you will fail to rise above what Maurya refers to as the  ceiling of achievement    It makes sense that the riskiest assumptions require the most attention  yet you cannot simply rely on your own intuition and expertise correctly prioritize your company s risks  regardless of how business savvy you are  Luckily  Mayra has provided a couple of ways for you to get started   Start with the 3 Universal Risks  If you re not sure which types of risks will demand the most scrutiny  begin by taking a look at the universal risks that apply to almost every product  These are   Ensuring your customer problem assumptions are valid   Ensuring these problems represent a monetizable pain  revenue stream    Ensuring that you have a path or can build a path to customers  channels    Talk to Domain Experts  Take the time to meet with experts and advisors with experience in the industry you re working in  Assuming you re meeting with knowledgeable authorities  this can be a valuable means of discovering the potential risks that your startup faces  However  keep in mind that you may receive conflicting views on the risk factors of your company  and that what worked for someone else may not necessarily work for you   Diana Kander  author of the New York Times bestseller All In Startup  outlined a systematic approach to prioritizing business assumptions in her blog post   How to Diagnose Your Riskiest Assumptions   According to Kander s method  each assumption you ve written down must be ranked according to two criteria   Possibility of assumption being wrong  Level of impact if assumption is wrong  Analyze every one of your assumptions and assign each a score of 1 to 5 on the possibility of it being wrong  and assign each a score of 1 to 10 on how detrimental an incorrect guess of this assumption would be to your startup  Then  multiply the two numbers to determine the overall risk level of each of your assumptions  The assumptions with the highest scores will need the most testing and planning   Click below for an easy to use Google Spreadsheet template   Test Your Assumptions  After you ve thoroughly laid out your assumptions and carefully scrutinized the risk factor of each  then you must test your assumptions and validate your ideas  While it may be tempting to adopt the rebellious mindset so often associated with innovative thinkers  it s best to avoid risking your livelihood if you can and take the time to ensure that your company will succeed   In fact  not only is substantiating your hypotheses a vital step in improving your startup s prospects  it can also be an inexpensive process  In the Growth List blog post   5 Ways To Validate Your Startup Ideas With  100   Sean Kim summarizes several ways that entrepreneurs can test their assumptions with little money   Build a Landing Page  Aaron Patzer  founder of Mint com  recommends the following approach   Validate The Idea   Create A Prototype   Build The Right Team   Raise Funding  With a landing page  you can bring people to your website  collect the emails of potential users  build your audience  and test the demand of your offering and discover what resonates with your audience   Launch a Crowdfunding Campaign  With the proliferation of crowdfunding platforms in recent years  entrepreneurs can now introduce their products and generate sales for it before they have their first prototype finished  If your crowdfunding goals are met  and hopefully even exceeded  you will then have the money you need to build and launch your product  as well as the confirmation that your product has an audience   Host a Webinar  While not talked about as much as a viable method  hosting a live webinar about your product or service is another effective way to measure the demand for your offering  Be sure to provide an exclusive offer to your audience at the end of your webinar with a link to a checkout page  With enough sales  you can build and launch your product to a waiting customer base   If you re the extraverted type  interviewing potential customers in person and hosting survey panels may be more suitable for your needs  In the eFounders blog post   How to validate a startup idea    Thibaud Elziere emphasizes how interviewing customers brings a quantitative aspect to a usually very qualitative process  and outlines several methods for getting the most out of meeting people in person   Interview at least 20 people who you think represent your target market and ask them about their current needs and how those needs are currently met   Next  ask these people questions the price of their currently solution  its quality  its performance  and its convenience  Each of these qualities may vary depending on the product or service  so be sure to establish the proper context for your questions  Here are examples of context for each of these qualities to help guide you   Price   purchase fee  setup  fee  subscription fee  license fee    Quality   relevance of results  infrastructure availability  customer service quality    Performance   response time  delivery time  travel speed  quantity of items  number of results    Convenience  easy to use  easy to carry on  easy to park  easy to access  easy to order   Final Thoughts  Risks are what make life worth living  Without taking the occasional risk  we may never get out of our comfort zone  learn new lessons  or experience the thrill of doing something most people never do  However  before you go diving into a potentially dangerous adventure  i e  launching a tech startup   taking the time to carefully analyze the troubles that you may encounter along the way will help you determine if that risk is worth taking    The biggest risk is not taking any risk    In a world that s changing really quickly  the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks     Mark Zuckerberg   business

experiments  Thomas Edison once said   I have learned fifty thousand ways it cannot be done and therefore I am fifty thousand times nearer the final successful experiment   Elsewhere  we have dug into the data on startups that died  as well as those acquihired  and found they usually die 20 months after raising financing and after having raised about  1 3 million  So we thought it would be useful to see how startup founders and investors describe their failures  While not exactly  50 000 ways it cannot be done   below is a compilation of startup post mortems that describe the factors that drove a startup s demise   Most of the failures have been told by the company s founders  but in a few cases  we did find a couple from competitors  early employees  or investors including Roger Ehrenberg  now of IA Ventures  and Bruce Booth  Atlas Venture   They are in no particular order  and there is something to learn from each and every one of them   The Top 20 Reasons Startups Fail We analyzed 100  startup failure post mortems and identified the top 20 reasons startups fail   The tail end of 2016 and start of 2017 were a rough period for startups  with over two dozen startups being culled from the herd  Pre smartphone answer service Cha Cha asked  can we stay in business   and received the answer  no   a drone company with tons of preorders and lots of buzz folded up and left customers stranded  and some blockchain startups ran into regulation challenges  complications  and plain old lack of funding  There are a million reasons startups fail  here are 26 more stories to add to the list   Title  ChaCha  unable to find financial answers  shuts down operations  Product  Cha Cha  Advertising revenue declined sharply  2016   leaving the company unable to service its debt  and no suitors took a bite  So its secured lender  which  founder Scott  Jones didn t name  recently emptied ChaCha s bank accounts   We sold some assets  but not enough to sufficiently cover all of our obligations   Jones said in an email Monday morning   Unfortunately  our debtholders and shareholders  including me  will be writing off their investment    Title  Why is Finance for Small Business Still Broken   Product  Dealstruck  Dealstruck closed its doors after more than three years in business  It did not close because the customer base isn t there or due to a lack of demand for its lending products  It closed because a deal fell through   Title  Vancouver s Shoes com shuts down operations  Product  Shoes com  Doug Stephens  founder of consultancy Retail Prophet  said the company suffered from having too few managers from the fashion industry and too many from the technology sector  And customer service  wasn t where it needed to be to give online customers the level of confidence necessary   especially in such a tricky category   It seems a matter of biting off way more than they could chew through a spate of acquisitions  Despite all the appearances of growth  market awareness was still quite low    Title  The Adventure Comes to an End  Product  Lily Robotics  In the past year  the Lily family has had many ups and downs  We have been delighted by the steady advancements in the quality of our product and have received great feedback from our Beta program  At the same time  we have been racing against a clock of ever diminishing funds  Over the past few months  we have tried to secure financing in order to unlock our manufacturing line and ship our first units   but have been unable to do this  As a result  we are deeply saddened to say that we are planning to wind down the company and offer refunds to customers    Title  VidAngel Just Crowdfunded  10M Using Reg A    Now Court Orders Video Streaming Business to Shut Down  Product  VidAngel  The judge has issued a preliminary injunction against VidAngel  requiring that we pull down all the studios  content  We are seeking a stay of this injunction  but if our efforts fail  we will need to take down the movies of all major studios   Title  App net is shutting down  Product  App net  Ultimately  we failed to overcome the chicken and egg issue between application developers and user adoption of those applications  We envisioned a pool of differentiated  fast growing third party applications would sustain the numbers needed to make the business work  Our initial developer adoption exceeded expectations  but that initial excitement didn t ultimately translate into a big enough pool of customers for those developers   Title  Home services startup Taskbob shuts shop  Product  TaskBob   a solid  home services  business is created only by building scalability and profitability  And to achieve those in a low margin business and in a tough external market proved unexpectedly daunting  More than what anyone could have expected   Title  ChangeTip Shutting Down  Product  ChangeCoin  We ve explored dozens of options  to stay in business  thoroughly over the past few months  and came up empty  It s time  Among other complications  the monthly costs to maintain the servers  services  and customer support to keep the site running are not insignificant  Furthermore  the potential legal liabilities that may arise make a volunteer effort unappealing   Title  Exclusive  Building materials marketplace Buildzar shuts down  Product  Buildzar  Buildzar started off as a pure play B2C ecommerce business  In June  it pivoted to a subscription model  Earlier  we used to generate leads and convert them into transactions ourselves  But  after the pivot  we were just doing lead generation and selling those leads in the market   When transactions failed to pick up  we decided to wind up operations  which in my opinion was the right decision   Title  A lot more wearable woe as Vinaya restructures and seeks pivot to b2b  Product  Vinaya  Whilst we ended up going by way of the system of founding and creating a buyer electronics corporation  it grew to become apparent that the projected amount of expansion for the B2C company by yourself was unlikely to be ready to maintain the expenses linked with the velocity of technological innovation necessary   to continue being aggressive in this space   Title  Boston startup Besomebody  once featured on  Shark Tank   shuts down app  Product  Besomebody  Shaikh cited three reasons for the decision  Most importantly  the demand wasn t there  especially when it came to repeat bookings  He said the business would only work if  tens of millions  of people were booking one to two experiences per year  and that just wasn t going to happen  Second  people were using the app to book fun  one time experiences  not to  truly learn  about their passions  And that led to the third problem  which was that the app only appealed to people who had expendable cash to put toward fun experiences  not to the full  multi million member community  that interacts with  besomebody content on Twitter and elsewhere on the web   Title  Unfortunate News  Product  BriefMe Media  In short  due to a lack of funding  we are now beginning the process of winding down BriefMe and will be turning off the servers next week   Our users are extremely passionate  but after pursuing every possible path  we no longer have a sustainable avenue forward for the company  Over recent months we ve been developing a significant update however we haven t been able to secure another round of funding to finish and get this work to market  Without sufficient capital to provide BriefMe the energy and attention it deserves we have decided to move forward in the best possible manner for our team  supporters and users   Title  Open source wearable Angel shuts down  Product  Angel Sensor  We ve been through a really rough patch over these past months  We ve experienced engineering and financing difficulties  downsized our R D and fought many battles to keep the project alive   Title  BitLendingClub Closing Soon Due to Regulatory Pressure  Product  Loanbase BitLendingClub  We ve worked extremely hard to build a platform and a community which is uniquely positioned to provide the Bitcoin ecosystem with a greatly needed service  However  over the last year or so  the regulatory pressures has been increasing to the point that it is no longer feasible to maintain the operation of the platform  We are regretfully announcing that we will have to begin terminating the services effective immediately   Title  Rendeevoo is no more  Product  Rendeevoo    we never managed to raise the next round in time so   the ugly reality slapped us hard  Bills were piling up on the business but also on our personal lives  We had to look for short term income by taking small jobs as individuals and that s what we did in order to pay our dues for October and November  In the meantime  we started discussing a potential exit with interested parties  Again  nothing fruitful happened on that front  Now it s time to make it official  Rendeevoo is no more   Title  Y Combinator backed Omniref is shutting down on January 31  2017  Product  Omniref  This isn t how we hoped things would turn out  but unfortunately  we were never able to find a sustainable business model that justifies the  considerable  expense of running the site  Because of the large number of developers who have come to depend on our services  we ve kept things running for as long as we possibly could  but unfortunately  there  s  no practical path forward from here   Title  Bitphone closing due to regulatory requirements  Product  bitphone  After 1 5 years in operation  bitphone net is shutting down  WE DIDN T GET HACKED  NOT ONCE  And believe me  they tried  All customer funds are secure and accounted for   And we are happy to say that   Unfortunately we ve had too many users abuse our phone service  Our underlying carrier service now requires we collect your identification when placing calls    We won t do it   This is an unfortunate outcome  we had recently enhanced our service considerably  We don t want to collect your identification  so we have no choice but to close the service   Title  All Romance eBooks is Shutting Down  Product  All Romance eBooks  It is with a great sadness that we announce the closing of All Romance eBooks  LLC  For the first year since opening in 2006  we will be posting a loss  Despite efforts to maintain and grow our market share  sales and profits have declined  The financial forecast for 2017 isn t hopeful  We ve accepted that there is not a viable path forward   Title  A Final Farewell From The Opsh Founders  Product  Opsh   ultimately we fell victim to the notoriously difficult investment chasm   the chasm that exists when a sparky start up needs to move into a global looking machine  And so  for some of you this won t come as a surprise  There is a distinctly unsexy side to running a start up that made every effort to push through almost impossible   Title  Plain Vanilla Closes Shop  Lays off Staff  Product  Plain Vanilla Games  In 2015 it was announced that NBC was going to develop a quiz show based on the game  which was supposed to premiere in spring 2017   We placed our bets on the extensive collaboration with the television giant NBC  One could say that we placed too many eggs in the NBC basket  We have spent a lot of time and energy on developing the show  When I received the message from NBC that they were canceling the production of the show  it became clear that the conditions for further operation  without substantial changes  were gone    CEO  orsteinn B  Fri riksson  stated   Title  Hello Hero s Song Players  Product  Pixelmage Games  For the last year  our team has worked tirelessly to make the game we ve dreamed about making  and with your support  and the support of our investors  we were able to get the game into Early Access  Unfortunately sales fell short of what we needed to continue development  We knew going in that most startups don t make it  and as an indie game studio we hoped we would be the exception to that rule  but as it turned out we weren t   Title  Alberta Health Services shuts down innovative meal sharing system  Product  Scarf  Alberta Health Services issued a cease and desist order to Scarf  shutting down the meal sharing service last month  In a written statement  Alberta Health Services said its duty is to  keep Albertans safe  This includes working with food operators to ensure they are meeting the provincial standards required to serve safe and healthy food to Albertans   AHS says all kitchens producing food for public consumption must have proper permits  Scarf cooks did not have those permits  Scarf operator Kian Parseyan  said    As individuals we re going to move on and suffer our losses   says Parseyan  who estimates that working on this project full time for a year cost between  60 000 and  70 000   Sometimes that s what happens in entrepreneurship  It s big risks and rewards    Title  Shelfie to Shutdown on 31 January   Download Your eBooks NOW  Product  Shelfie  From their shutdown announcement   We regret to inform you that Shelfie will be ceasing operations on January 31  2017   We started Shelfie with the idea of connecting books and readers and we have worked hard over the past four years to make that a reality  We are grateful for the support we have received from amazing readers like you  who have been a part of Shelfie   Founder Peter Hudson  said via  email that    In the end the unit economics of ebook sales just don t make much sense if you don t own the platform like Apple  Google  or Amazon    Title   TheParrot says goodbye   Product  The Social Radio  The Social Radio began as a side project   raised money as a startup  and then became side project again when we couldn t scale it  We didn t see it getting big enough to have the impact we had hoped for  so we stopped updating the apps as our lives and jobs became busy  but people kept using them and we believed in the product  so we kept the apps running  But we have reached a point where the cost of running the apps cannot be covered  and we couldn t get enough support to keep it running   Title  Exclusive  Online rental marketplace WhatsOnRent shuts shop  returns 50  funding  Product  WhatsOnRent   The shutdown was a conscious business decision  We could not see the next round of funding coming  We had to change the consumer mindset and without that pre Series A funding of couple of million dollars it was not possible  It was also a business decision that this business might not work    Title  Taking Our Goggles Off  Product  Vrideo  With only  2 million raised  we ve accomplished all this up against competitors that have three to 50 times     our funding   Unfortunately  though  we ve now stretched this modest funding as far as it could take us  especially in light of the rising costs associated with our growth   The past few years have been a wild ride  When we first started working on Vrideo  Facebook hadn t yet acquired Oculus  Sony hadn t announced  Project Morpheus   and Google wasn t even talking about VR  It s been a privilege to play a role  however small  in the emergence of this new medium  We ll be rooting for all of you who continue to carry it forward   We rounded up 12 more startups whose lessons ranged from  stick to what you re good at  to  don t use your VC money like a personal piggy bank   Classic startup issues like running out of money  getting squeezed out by bigger players  and failing to find a market fit and MVP are also on display  One notable entrant actually gave money back to their VCs so that it could possibly help fund other new companies  There s something you don t see every day   Title  How SunEdison went from Wall Street star to bankruptcy  Product  SunEdison  SunEdison at its core is a boring construction company  that earns the trust of its institutional investors by being boring and managing risks    but the company s senior executives  didn t want to be boring  they wanted to be a technology company   Title  Walgreens to Shut Down Drugstore com  Focus On Own Website  Product  Drugstore com   Walgreen s wants  to make sure they can invest more of the equity in Walgreens com  Drugstore com and Beauty com are distractions   Title  Bye  Drugstore com  What price  Beauty com  Walgreens pays for dot com lesson  Product  Drugstore com  At the end of the day  it s about getting new customers  increasing the frequency of transactions and increasing transaction sizes  When I see the retirement of these two domain names  I see a play  for Walgreens com  in all those spaces   Title  MaxPlay lays off almost all workers as game engine startup switches to licensing  Product  Maximum Play  For a variety of reasons  more on the side of the money guys and not because of us  the transaction didn t go through   We had several groups looking to acquire us  and for a variety of reasons those didn t pan out   We were building an enterprise software platform  It was a very expensive proposition  with high potential rewards   There was a high demand and high interest in what we were doing  That is what was so disappointing  I think you will see several companies license our technology   This has nothing to do with the competition  It has to do with the funding issue  I think there is huge demand for new approaches with game engine technology   Title  Failed HUD Helmet Maker Skully Spent Funding On Strippers And Exotic Cars  Lawsuit  Product  Skully Helmets   The Wellers  Skully s founders  routinely demanded  that their accountant  engage in fraudulent bookkeeping practices designed to defraud investors in Skully into believing that Skully funds were being used for business purposes  when in fact  the funds were being used to pay the personal expenses of the Wellers   In hindsight  Skully appeared to be kind of shady for some time  The company continuously pushed back its promised release date while sucking down  2 446 824 from Indie GoGo backers that s 979 percent of the  250 000  goal  they  needed  to get running   Title  Millions still in the bank  GoZoomo shuts shop  returns VC money  The whole story    Product  GoZoomo  We tried to build a fast scaleable business  but realized that the business model does not work  So it is better that this capital gets deployed elsewhere instead of us hoarding it and hoping that something good happens   Title  Photo storage service Picturelife shuts down 18 months after being acquired  Product  Picturelife  Nobody is interested in cloud storage anymore  It s been pretty challenging  Google Photos and Amazon they took a huge chunk of  the cloud photo storage market   And I think it s going to increase over time   Is there a business for a small player  I don t think so any more   Title  Why we re shutting down Hivebeat and what we ve learned along the way  Product  Hivebeat  We ve tried all the things we wanted to try and we have a pretty good sense of what went wrong  We never hit real product market fit  We built a product that was too generic for a very niche based industry   Our product was great  but it wasn t a 10x product  We had a much prettier product than the competition  but we were always lacking features in every niche   We were trying to do too many things at the same time  Both product wise and marketing wise   A transaction based business model makes it hard to predict revenue  which made our growth curve look like a rollercoaster   Title  Thanks and farewell  Product  Electroloom  The bottom line is that we simply do not have the financial ability to continue supporting the company   The reality is that a lot of events factored into our inability to raise  slow technical progress  significant scientific risk  a lack of an MVP  and a poorly defined market opportunity   Title  MobileIgniter to Shut Down After Five Years and Multiple Pivots  Product  MobileIgniter  What we found was that the sales cycle for the market we specifically wanted to go after is just way too long for a small company to absorb  Originally  we estimated that the sales cycle would be somewhere between three and six months  We then adjusted that to say it s nine to 12 months   We hope to see IoT embraced by manufacturing and ag in the state and in the region  But it s not going to be because of us   Title  CMS Killed My  80M Venture Backed Startup  Product  Sonitus Medical  We took a prevalent surgical treatment into the office where we reduced the cost by half and we significantly impact patient safety because there was no surgery involved and we made it more effective   They  The Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  CMS   arbitrarily draw a line saying   No  you are not qualified for coverage because the way we draw a line between what s a prosthetic and what s a hearing aid is whether it involves surgery or not    Title  Gawker Says Goodbye With Emotion and Defiance  Product  Gawker Media  I wish I d known how litigious Hulk Hogan was   I m kind of glad I didn t  hold back from publishing the tape  because if every publisher and every editor made editorial decisions based on who is scary and well funded and litigious and uses the court system to exercise power  to edit what is out there about them  then the news would look very very different than it does   Title  Uber rival Karhoo shuts down after blowing through a reported  250M in funding   Product  Karhoo  Ultimately   its  structure   is based on very large economies of scale   building out any transport service before it can get to that scale is extremely capital intensive   Karhoo  however  didn t appear to have the reach with consumers to achieve anything like enough scale   Its shutdown letter states that the   Karhoo staff around the world in London  New York  Singapore and Tel Aviv have  over the past 18 months  sic   worked tirelessly to make Karhoo a success  Many of them have worked unpaid for the last six weeks in an effort to get the business to a better place  Unfortunately  by the time the new management team took control last week  it was clear that the financial situation was pretty dire  and Karhoo was not able to find a backer     Chief executive Daniel Ishag put the funding amount at  52M in a Nov  10 interview with The Financial Times   We rounded up 10 more startups whose lessons ranged from fraud and investor dropouts  to logistics issues and product problems  A recurring element in this cohort was running out of runway and being unable to raise more financing   Title  The right words to say goodbye  Product  Take Eat Easy  The reasons are that 1  our revenues do not cover our costs  and 2  we are not able to close a third fundraiser    In March 2016  after having been rejected by 114 VC funds  we signed a term sheet with a French  state owned  logistics group  for a 30M euro investment  Unfortunately  after 3 months of intensive due diligence  their board rejected the deal and they ended up withdrawing their offer  We were negotiating with them under an exclusivity agreement  didn t have a plan B  and only had a couple of weeks of run way left   Title  The PepperTap Journey  our story  Product  PepperTap   as we forayed into smaller cities  delivery networks got more fragmented and lethargic  This needed to be researched more and understood better  We found that while tiers 2 and 3 of Indian cities are being served to some extent by new world logistics providers doing cool things like one day shipping  there was a whole slew of tier 3 5  cities which are connected to the world of ecommerce but  in simple terms  have to sometimes wait up to 30 days to receive their orders   Title  How Dinner Lab Blew Through  10 Million On A Failed Restaurant Startup  Product  Dinner Lab  It s just a really challenging logistical marketplace  For us  producing unique events presented big challenges   We were trying to scale a business that was very logistically complicated and we were always screwing up  It was also really challenging to get solid  consistent margins  We stacked the deck against ourselves   There were a lot of variables that were difficult to manage  We had an ever changing landscape of staff  sourcing ingredients and everything else  That s also what made the product very cool   We weren t able to piece together the necessary funding  It  forseeing Dinner Lab s closure  was pretty clear   Title  Lights Out for Yeloha   Why We Shut Down the Solar Sharing Network  Product  Yeloha  While our peer to peer model was accepted by hosts and subscribers alike with real excitement  installing  Hosted  solar systems at scale depended on 3rd party project finance by banks or specialized solar funds   But we couldn t convince traditional project financiers to test our thesis  We were forced to self finance the first couple of projects as a proof of concept  but did not have the resources or runway to continue   Eventually Yeloha shut down because we could not raise the financing we needed in order to massively grow our network  Timing hurt  The so called  Venture Capital winter  of 2016 coincided with the turmoil in the solar stock market and the bankruptcy of multi billion dollar SunEdison  venture investors fled from solar  and strategic investors crystalized their strategy around profitability   Title  We Shut Down Our Edtech Startup  Here s What We Learned   Product  SharpScholar  The stakeholders in education students  teachers  administration  and the government  budgets  policy  voters  operate very interdependently  This means that if a teacher wants to use a tool or software he or she has to keep in mind the students  school policy  budget considerations  and even get approval from the administration   At SharpScholar we created a highly interdependent product the usage of the product depended on approval from students and admin which effectively complicated our relationship with the teacher  This resulted in us having different messaging for students  teachers  and admin as well as lack of focus as to who we are tailoring to  Lesson Learned  Minimize or eliminate layers of approval and interdependence of your product  Teachers prefer not to use tools that require different layers of approval from others   Title  Lady Gaga s startup Backplane burns out and sells assets  Product  Backplane  The problem was that  CEO Scott  Harrison says the big name VC money came with tough liquidation preferences that would give those investors returns first if Backplane had a successful exit  When the cash recently ran out  the firms wouldn t put more in  and their reluctance and the bad deal terms scared away new investors  Harrison tells me my article on the company s previous stumbles also hurt its fundraising abilities  A Chinese backer was supposed to spearhead a  2 5 million round to keep the startup alive  but they dropped out last minute   Title  Identity verification startup Jumio files for bankruptcy  will sell assets to early backer Eduardo Saverin  Product  Jumio  However  it  Jumio  competed with similar technologies like Card io  which

it had hired outside auditors though didn t find anything out of the ordinary   Title  TrustBuddy Loses Trust  Peer to Peer Platform Closes Following  Suspected Misconduct   Swedish Police Contacted

  Due to the extreme nature of the uncovered misdeeds  Swedish police have been contacted  Members of the previous management team have been placed on suspension during the investigation  The misconduct was said to be  likely in place since the TrustBuddy platform began operation    Title  After laying off most of its staff  clothing resale startup Fashion Project regroups  Product  Fashion Project   CEO Anna  Palmer says that much of the  7 million the company raised last year  went into the hiring and the systems needed to sort donations and get them up on the site  We were receiving thousands of items daily    Palmer also says that it has proven difficult to compete with better funded consignment startups when it comes to spending on marketing that brings in shoppers  In the Bay Area  the RealReal has raised  83 million  and ThredUp  founded in Cambridge but now based in San Francisco  has raised about  125 million  The capital pouring into those resale sites made it more difficult for  specialized  clothing consignment startups like Fashion Project to attract investment  Palmer says   Title  Post Ghost Shutdown  An Open Letter to Twitter  Product  PostGhost  On July 6  2016  PostGhost com received the following email from Twitter  which says in part that  postghost com displays deleted Tweets and is currently violating our Developer Agreement and Policy    The funding and deal activity pullback in Q4 15 was a reality check for venture  and there is more of a focus on business fundamentals  We rounded up 10 startups deserving of an autopsy from the tail end of 2015  From Rdio to the massive KiOR  that raised  403M in total funding   there were a variety of lessons to be learned  hiring problems  inability to compete  legal issues  and many more   Title  Why Rdio died  Product  Rdio   Rdio  I guess  made the mistake of trying to be sustainable too early   says  early employee Wilson  Miner   That classic startup mistake of worrying about being profitable and having a business that makes any sense before you ve reached this astronomical growth curve  Which is partly the trap of the business model itself   because of the content licensing deals  the margins for the business were so incredibly thin  No matter what we did  the labels made the lion s share of the revenue  You have to make it up with extreme volume  which is why you see Spotify going after every human being in the world    Title  How Tech Billionaire Vinod Khosla s Biofuel Dream Went Bad  Product  KiOR  Different parties disagree about which side was responsible Khosla Ventures or  chemical engineer Paul  O Connor and the CEO but most agree that KiOR made poor hiring decisions as it staffed up  The result was a relative preponderance of lab researchers with Ph D s and a dearth of people with technical  operational experience running energy facilities  The lack of people with real operational experience  hurt KiOR a lot   says O Connor   Title  Why We Sold to GM  Product  SideCar  In short  we were forced to shut down operations and sell  We were unable to compete against Uber  a company that raised more capital than any other in history and is infamous for its anti competitive behavior  The legacy of Sidecar is that we out innovated Uber but still failed to win the market  We failed   for the most part   because Uber is willing to win at any cost and they have practically limitless capital to do it   Title  Why did HealthSpot fail  The telemedicine industry weighs in  Product  Healthspot  Jason Gorevic  CEO of telemedicine company Teladoc  expressed his belief that there are three critical elements to success in this industry segment  the technology platform  clinical capabilities and consumer engagement   Consumer engagement is hard to do   Gorevic said  This is where HealthSpot may have fallen down  Teladoc has two revenue streams  a per member  per month fee it charges its partners  plus a per visit fee   Because we have both of those revenue sources  we can pour that money back into our customers     Also  Teladoc is purely a software company  so it doesn t have the overhead associated with building and delivering kiosks   A bigger issue  according to  CEO of American Well Roy  Schoenberg  is that HealthSpot required patients and providers to pre arrange appointments  it was not truly telemedicine on demand   You actually have to build a lot of administration around it   he said   Title  The Beginning of the End  Product  Flytenow  On Friday  December 18  2015 the U S  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia denied our request to overturn the Federal Aviation Administration s ban on Flytenow and other online flight sharing websites We started Flytenow over two years ago to share the joy of flying by allowing aviation enthusiasts to meet pilots and go flying together Unfortunately  we are left with no choice but to shut down Flytenow  However  we are still fighting as pilots to make this happen   Title  Dehli based ogistics startup Delivree King shuts down  Product  Delivree King   We had scaled to about 15 cities but it was becoming very difficult to sustain operations at that level with no funds  This business requires money to scale up and without funds it s very difficult to break even   said  co founder Akash  Sharma   Title  London hotel ranking startup Top10 raised  12 million in funding   but now it s shutting down  Product  Top 10  The hotel industry is particularly challenging given the size  reach and budgets of the big players  At Top10 we did an amazing job innovating in this tough space  but ultimately the competitive landscape made it too expensive for us to scale  and for that reason we decided to close the company   Title  Prismatic is shutting down its news app for iOS  Android  and Web on December 20  Product  Prismatic   Four years ago  we set out to build a personalized news reader that would change the way people consume content   the Prismatic team wrote in a blog post   For many of you  we did just that  But we also learned content distribution is a tough business and we ve failed to grow at a rate that justifies continuing to support our Prismatic News products    Title  AT T Snaps Up Assets  Talent From Carrier iQ  Phone Monitoring Startup Goes Offline  Product  Carrier IQ  Knowledge of what  our  software tracked unbeknownst to the average user clearly hit a nerve with a public already skeptical about how private information is regarded by large corporations and other organizations for their own purposes   And so  unsurprisingly  following the revelations  there was a windfall of announcements about which companies were using it  and were not using it  to collect information  lawsuits over privacy violations and legislation drafted to tighten controls for the future  Some of those class action suits  it appears  have been settled  As AT T did not acquire the full company  we understand that it will not be liable for any outstanding litigation or settlements against CIQ   Title  Heart Drug Safety Concerns Prompt Shutdown at Laguna Pharmaceuticals  Product  Laguna Pharmaceuticals  Two months into its roughly 600 patient initial Phase 3 trial  called Restore SR  researchers started to see side effects that would not have enabled Laguna to market the drug as widely as they had initially anticipated   Laguna CEO Bob  Baltera said   We were actually very surprised   he said   The  prior  Phase 2 study was robust   Baltera declined to say much about the side effects  describing them only as  safety signals    The normal response in this business is to find a way forward   Baltera said   But it just wasn t going to be commercially viable  Rather than trying to find any path forward  we decided to shut the company down     2015 Update 2  12 3 2015   From Quirky to Homejoy to Zen99  we ve added 11 startup post mortems to the 34 we previously added in our first 2015 update  While unicorns continue to be minted and mega rounds continue  there are still many new lessons to be learned from startups facing risks as they navigate the turbulent contract worker economy or failing to acquire customers  The 11 new additions  below   Title  Pixable Closing Up Shop After One Crazy  Awesome Ride    Product  Pixable    We achieved what we set out to do  even if the final result didn t end up with us becoming the next Buzzfeed  We never wanted to be the next Buzzfeed  We always wanted to be who we were  Pixable  And it was working  Unfortunately  circumstances  despite reaching 9 4M active users and 58M monthly video views    made it difficult to raise money and continue on   Title  Bitcoin Reputation Startup Bonafide to Shut Down    Product  Bonafide  In the email  co founders Karthik Balasubramanian and Brian Moyer stated their belief that the movement of investor interest away from consumer facing applications for the technology was also a factor  Balasubramanian and Moyer wrote   While investment and activity continues to occur it is focused on private and alternate chains rather than bitcoin or other public chains where Bonafide operates   As a result  the co founders said they saw  little chance  that they would be able to generate revenue  pivot their product or secure additional funding   Title  After Falling Through The Series A Gap  Restaurant Delivery Startup Dine In Shutters    Product  Dine In   We knew acquisition was the best course of action   says  Evan  Graj  That eventually led to Dine In being approached in February by a major Internet company active in the online food space  and it s my understanding that by April   and significant legal fees later   a sale had been agreed  Then at the eleventh hour the deal unexpectedly fell through  leaving the restaurant delivery startup  high and dry  and its unnamed acquirer a  no show   Adds Graj   They backed out leaving us with a huge legal bill both for Dine In and myself personally  a huge debt to note holders  and no VCs to turn to  A hard lesson to learn and one I ll be taking into my next venture    Title  The Rise and Fall of Quirky   the Start Up That Bet Big on the Genius of Regular Folks  Product  Quirky  Steering the ship   handling all of the engineering  manufacturing  marketing  and retailing  even when you re taking 90 percent of the subsequent profits   was ultimately too expensive of a proposition  especially in comparison to other  less handholding oriented start ups   The reason why Kickstarter makes a ton of money is they don t have to do anything besides put up a website   Kaufman notes   Title  Homejoy Shuts Down After Battling Worker Classification Lawsuits  Product  Homejoy  CEO Adora Cheung said the  deciding factor  was the four lawsuits it was fighting over whether its workers should be classified as employees or contractors  None of them were class actions yet  but they made fundraising that much harder   A lot of this is unfortunate timing  The  California Labor Commission s  Uber decision   was only a single claim  but it was blown out of proportion   she told Re code   Title  Selltag has shut down  Product  Selltag  Escribano said that the company s main problem was user engagement and retention   In every marketplace you have the chicken and egg problem with buyers and sellers  We tried to capture them both organically and via paid marketing  but it wasn t enough  Getting sellers was somewhat easy  but buyers much more complicated   Title  Why Zen99 Shut Down  Product  Zen99  We had a user acquisition problem  and the best route involved a competitor The best acquisition method I saw was tapping into an existing network of people who had filed 1099s  like Intuit s hundreds of millions of tax returns  many with 1099 income  Unfortunately  Intuit released an identical competing product to us  It s not ideal when your best user acquisition strategy is partnering with a company who has a competing product   Title  RIP QBotix  Robotic Solar Tracking Fails to Reach the Market  Product  QBotix  Each member of our now pared down team knew exactly how much runway the company had remaining  the status of our strategic talks  and the acknowledged long odds we faced as a going concern  To their credit  they remained focused  productive and on task

Inside story of VATLER s shut down  Product  Vatler  We started VATLER during the summer of 2014 as an on demand valet service in San Francisco   We received a phone call from the police department telling us that our permits had not been granted and they gave us a warning because we were operating illegally in most of our locations In 2 weeks  we lost major accounts and 30  of our revenue streams without any perspective of growth  We tried to make some restaurants pay but it was just not working  Our model was no longer valid and were forced to cease operations in the city on September 7th   Title  Lessons From Mayo Clinic backed Better Shutting Down  Product  Better  Better had one of the best consumer user experiences out there but that isn t enough  One of my formative Internet experiences was being part of the founding team of Microsoft Sidewalk  later acquired by CitySearch  in 1995  Sidewalk was  too far ahead of its time with some user experiences only coming into the mainstream now  The Internet audience was too small  the bandwidth too low and the digital advertising too nascent  My hunch is Better faced similar issues  As much as I d love for healthcare to be a consumer driven market  I m afraid we re at least 3 5 years away from it no longer being  too early    Title  Shopa shuts down just months after raising  7m in growth capital    Product  Shopa

lessons to be learned from startups taking on out of control burn rates or failing to monetize properly The 34 new additions  below   Title  Sunset  Product  Secret  Unfortunately  Secret does not represent the vision I had when starting the company  so I believe it s the right decision for myself  our investors and our team   Title  What Happened and What s Next  Product  Zirtual  So what went wrong  Short answer  burn  Burn is that tricky thing that isn t discussed much in the Silicon Valley community because access to capital  in good times  seems so easy  Burn is the amount of money that goes out the door  over and above what comes in  so if you earn  100 in a month but pay out  150  your burn is  50   Title  Farewell to Circa News  Product  Circa  Our ongoing plan was to monetize Circa News through the building of a strategy we had spent a long time developing but unfortunately we were unable to close a significant investment prior to becoming resource constrained   Title

they got stuck with the chicken egg problem   Title  Melotic Exchange Shutting Down  Product  Melotic  After much deliberation  we at Melotic have decided to take the unfortunate step of winding down

more recently published additions from this year including 99dresses  Fenox VC   Dinnr  Unifyo  EC1 Capital  and VoterTide  Optimas Group    Title  My startup failed  and this is what it feels like   Product  99dresses  And the rest of the conversation explained why they would not be doing that  My stomach dropped  I knew they were our best shot of getting the money  and some of the angels who had previously invested were interested in coming in but only if I could get a VC to lead it  probably for some oversight  We now had very little cash left  and very little time to find someone else   Title  Seven lessons I learned from the failure of my first startup  Dinnr  Product  Dinnr  This turns out to be the original sin of Dinnr   there never was an opportunity  And whatever we did later to try to breathe life into it  iterating on the website  different marketing tactics  was akin to giving aspirin to a deathbed patient   Title  How I Failed Launching Seismic Video  Product  Seismic Video  Sure  it was seven years ago  pre iPhone and pre Android  so it was ahead of its time  we had to use Adobe Flash on a browser which sucked in so many ways I can t even start to explain how bad it was  Technology would be so much better and more important all mobile today   Title  Thoughts on shutting down Treehouse Logic  Product  Treehouse Logic  Startups fail when they are not solving a market problem  We were not solving a large enough problem that we could universally serve with a scalable solution  We had great technology  great data on shopping behavior  great reputation as a though leader  great expertise  great advisors  etc  but what we didn t have was technology or business model that solved a pain point in a scalable way   Title  The End of a Great Experience  Product  Backchat  Unfortunately we were not able to adapt fast enough to changing market and product conditions which quickly began to show in usage metrics  With a feed product on the horizon all looked well until our funding began to dry up  Deals fell through leaving me in the difficult position to close Backchat and YouTell   Title  Why Patient Communicator Failed  Product  Patient Communicator  I realized that many of the true money making businesses in healthcare really aren t about optimizing delivery of primary care  This is a longer discussion but I realized  essentially  that we had no customers because no one was really interested in the model we were pitching  Doctors want more patients  not an efficient office   Title  Twitpic is shutting down  Product  Twitpic  Unfortunately we do not have the resources to fend off a large company like Twitter to maintain our mark which we believe whole heartedly is rightfully ours  Therefore  we have decided to shut down Twitpic   Title  Week 483  Product  Berg  We ve not reached a sustainable business in connected products  But  There s our troop   Cultural inventions  I m proud of this British Experimental Rocket Group  Thank you fellow travellers  in your thousands  Behind the mountains  there are more mountains   Title  The Final Note  Product  Wishberg  We set very high goals for us when we raised our first investment in April 2013  As a startup  data is your best friend  Reviewing those goals at the end of the year  we realised that we have trailed behind on few of them  For us a team  we have always believed in chasing bigger dreams and not take up smaller challenges   Title  Failure of a success  Product  GreenGar Studios  If you still remember my pitch   We already made  1 million  Let s talk about  1 billion   Maybe one day that statement will come true  and I m still working very hard on that  However  it will not be with my GreenGar chapter   Title  The inside story of Rivet   Sway  Product  Rivet   Sway  If only running a business were straightforward enough to boil down to one thing I would change to effect a different outcome  Hindsight is 20 20  no glasses needed   so there are a lot of things I would do differently  Here are a few at the top of my list  Drive market awareness dominance regionally  Seattle  NW  West Coast   Adapt the Home Try On model sooner  Scale only when absolutely necessary  we outsourced to a big company 3PL way too early   Focus more on PR  Get more sleep  Title  Why our startup failed  Product  Dijiwan  A good product idea and a strong technical team are not a guarantee of a sustainable business  One should not ignore the business process and issues of a company because it is not their job  It can eventually deprive them from any future in that company   Title  Some news about Wantful  Product  Wantful  What we did not accomplish yet is the kind of highly accelerated growth required to secure later stage venture capital  despite the enduring enthusiasm around what we ve built  The coming holiday season was shaping up to be pivotal for us  but the loss last week of a planned follow on investment from a strategic partner leaves us little time to secure an alternate source of capital  or to pursue the other opportunities on the table   Title  The Disruptive Advantage 3  Product  Disruptive Media  Launching this globally would have required lots of funding in order to get production and logistics to work well internationally  Getting deals with big international companies was hard and plugging into their production pipeline turned out to be technically impossible  since they did not have any APIs  It s hard to tell whether this would have worked  since we were running out of money and had to leave it there  Potential investors were not too crazy about investing in a declining market either  The numbers did not fully work out   Title  Low power won t bag ARM the server crown  Product  Calxeda  In  Calxeda s  case  we moved faster than our customers could move  We moved with tech that wasn t really ready for them   ie  with 32 bit when they wanted 64 bit  We moved when the operating system environment was still being fleshed out    Ubuntu Linux maker  Canonical is all right  but where is Red Hat  We were too early   Title  Shutting down  Product  Turntable fm  Ultimately  I didn t heed the lessons of so many failed music startups  It s an incredibly expensive venture to pursue and a hard industry to work with  We spent more than a quarter of our cash on lawyers  royalties and services related to supporting music  It s restrictive  We had to shut down our growth because we couldn t launch internationally  It s a long road  It took years to get label deals in place and it also took months of engineering time to properly support them  time which could have been spent on product    Title  When SEO fails   Single channel dependency and the end of Tutorspree  Product  Tutorspree  Although we achieved a lot with Tutorspree  we failed to create a scalable business   Tutorspree didn t scale because we were single channel dependent and that channel shifted on us radically and suddenly  SEO was baked into our model from the start  and it became increasingly important to the business as we grew and evolved  In our early days  and during Y Combinator  we didn t have money to spend on acquisition  SEO was free so we focused on it and got good at it   Title  A Nirvanix Postmortem   Why There s No Replacement For Due Diligence  Product  Nirvanix  The cloud is great  Outsourcing is great  Unreliable services aren t  The bottom line is that no one cares about your data more than you do   there is no replacement for a robust due diligence process and robust thought about avoiding reliance on any one vendor   Title  PostRocket to Shut Down  Product  PostRocket  When we first started PostRocket  we wanted to not only help marketers like you succeed in Facebook marketing  but do so with an exceptional product and service to back it  We were never able to reach the high bar we set for ourselves  Our product had many issues and even through the down time and bugs  you stuck with us  We thank you for that   Title  VoterTide Postmortem  Product  VoterTide  We didn t spend enough time talking with customers and were rolling out features that I thought were great  but we didn t gather enough input from clients  We didn t realize it until it was too late  It s easy to get tricked into thinking your thing is cool  You have to pay attention to your customers and adapt to their needs   Title  A Startup Postmortem  Product  SkyRocket  But one day something changed  Money stopped coming in the door  In addition to a lag in sales  new product challenges arose and pretty soon I began to question myself  With each pitch following that period of doubt whether it was to a girl at a party or an interested investor my enthusiasm and perceived confidence dwindled   Title  A Story of GameLayers  Product  GameLayers  Ultimately I believe PMOG lacked too much core game compulsion to drive enthusiastic mass adoption  The concept of  leave a trail of playful web annotations  was too abstruse for the bulk of folks to take up  Looking back I believe we needed to clear the decks  swallow our pride  and make something that was easier to have fun with  within the first few moments of interaction   Title  Serendip Is Shutting Down  Product  Serendip  The high costs of processing millions of posts every day  and serving relevant and engaging playlists to our users across our web service and mobile app  yes  no Android  I know   are really bigger than we can handle  a very challenging position for a small startup to be in   Title  Unifyo   Post Mortem  Product  Unifyo  We aimed to build a great  highly automated user experience first  focusing on the end users and SMEs with plans to grow into companies from the bottom up  like Skype  Yammer  Dropbox   We couldn t empathize with big corporations and heard only scary things about the long sales cycles  However  every company we have kept track of in the  relationship management  space has either shut down or moved at least into the B2B space  Title  Couldery Shouldery  Company  Lookery  We exposed ourselves to a huge single point of failure called Facebook  I ve ranted for years about how bad an idea it is for startups to be mobile carrier dependent  In retrospect  there is no difference between Verizon Wireless and Facebook in this context  To succeed in that kind of environment requires any number of resources  One of them is clearly significant outside financing  which we d explicitly chosen to do without  We could have and should have used the proceeds of the convertible note to get out from under Facebook s thumb rather to invest further in the Facebook Platform   We ve added 25 additional startup post mortems  which include many recent additions in the past several months such as Canvas  Union Square Ventures  Andreessen Horowitz   Outbox  Founders Fund  Floodgate   Manilla  Hearst Corp   and AdMazely  SEED Capital   The newest additions have been added to the top of the post   Title  Today my startup failed  Company  Canvas Networks  It may seem surprising that a seemingly successful product could fail  but it happens all the time  Although we arguably found product market fit  we couldn t quite crack the business side of things  Building any business is hard  but building a business with a single app offering and half of your runway is especially hard   Title  Shutting Down Blurtt  Company  Blurtt  I started to feel burned out  I was Blurtt s fearless leader  but the problem with burnout is that you become hopeless and you lose every aspect of your creativity  I d go to work feeling tired and exhausted  I was burning the candle at both ends  Do not launch a startup if you do not have enough funding for multiple iterations  The chances of getting it right the first time are about the equivalent of winning the lotto   Title  Manilla Is Shutting Down  Company  Manilla  This was a hard decision given that  over the past three years  Manilla has won many awards and has been well supported by its valued user base but was unable to achieve the scale necessary to make the economics of the business viable   Title  A startup postmortem with a happy ending    in Thailand  Company  Pumodo  Our biggest self realization was that we were not users of our own product  We didn t obsess over it and we didn t love it  We loved the idea of it  That hurt   Title  Startup Failure  How it feels  Company  Admazely  My presentation was ok  The mandatory Q A afterwards was horrible  The only two people in the room that we hadn t gotten prior support from were skeptical to say the least  As I left the room I was shattered  And as my contact didn t call me later on that day I knew where it was going  My chairman didn t either  Not a good sign   Title  Springpad Says Goodbye  Company  Springpad  Unfortunately  we were not able to secure additional funding or scale to become a self sustaining business  Thank you to our loyal users and partners   We couldn t have made Springpad what it was without you   Title  Changing Tune  Company  Exfm  The high costs of processing millions of new songs every month while attempting to keep that data relevant and useable is monumental  The technical challenges are compounded by the litigious nature of the music industry  which means every time we have any meaningful growth  it s coupled with the immediate attention of the record labels in the form of takedowns and legal emails   Title  Samba Closing Down  Company  Samba Mobile  Samba has had to take the difficult decision to close  primarily due to high and increasing   and therefore unsustainable   data costs  This makes the current model of offering a meaningful value exchange of mobile broadband unsustainable   Title  inBloom Retiring  Company  inBloom  It is a shame that the progress of important innovation has been stalled because of generalized public concerns about data misuse  We stepped up to the occasion and supported our partners with passion  but we have realized that this concept is still new  and building public acceptance for the solution will require more time and resources than anyone could have anticipated   Title  Starting Findory  The end  Company  Findory  I learned that a cheap is good  but too cheap is bad  It does little good to avoid burning too fast only to starve yourself of what you need  I re learned the importance of a team  one that balances the weaknesses of some with the strengths of another  As fun as learning new things might be  trying to do too much yourself costs the startup too much time in silly errors born of inexperience  I learned the necessity of good advisors  especially angels and lawyers  A startup needs people who can provide expertise  credibility  and connections  You need advocates to help you   Title  FindIt is shutting down   Thank you for all the support   Company  FindIt  Starting a company and trying to change the world is no easy task  In the process we learned that the majority of our users did not need FindIt often enough to justify our continued time and effort on this problem   Title  The little startup that couldn t  a postmortem of MyFavorites   Company  MyFavorites  Having a web app being created at the same time was ridiculous too   especially since we still hadn t nailed down the favoriting process or tried it with any users  I was blowing cash   at a ridiculous pace  I had 7 guys working on this thing at once  as we were hustling for SXSW launch deadline  We decided to focus on the iPhone app  which sucked for me and Dan the backend programmer  because we both couldn t even use the app   we both have Droid X phones   Title  Inq Mobile Shuts Down  Company  Inq Mobile  Inq has been a really exciting business over the last few years and whilst there have been significant successes  the technology that s been borne out of that work has been identified to have greater application within the wider Group  Consequently  we ve taken the hard decision to close the Inq business down   Title  Outbox is Shutting Down A Note of Gratitude  Company  Outbox  Giant  complex systems appear insurmountable  but aren t they were built by people just like you and me The main asset the government  and big companies  has is time which is the resource of which startups have the least  You may think government organizations are completely  insanely backwards  you are wrong they are worse  If you can t find a hardware solution to your needs  build it it s not that hard  Doing extraordinary things for customers is time consuming and hard but very worthwhile  Life is too short to pursue anything other than what you are most passionate about   Title  Argyle Social is shutting down our service  Company  Argyle  We re a very small company based in a great area  but it s definitely not Silicon Valley  It s a double edged sword  because in the Valley  you d be paying twice as much for developers and land  But out there  there s a different attitude toward raising money   Title  What I learned about online to offline  Company  Exec  Many new online to offline entrepreneurs have asked me about my experience founding Exec  Unit economics matter a lot more than in pure software businesses  Turnover of errand runners was very high  Demand was very spiky  Customer activation was hard  We shouldn t have run jobs ourselves   Title  Close  but no cigar  Company  Bloom fm  After Bloom fm was placed into administration we received incredible amount of support from our users and a lot of commercial interest from prospective buyers  One offer stood out in particular  as it would have allowed Bloom to continue in the spirit we originally intended  We have worked furiously on finalising it but unfortunately  due to very tight timelines and complexities associated with the administration process  the deal fell through at the last minute   Title  Stipple Shuts Down  Company  Stipple  We had turned on revenue  but did not scale fast enough  We were not yet profitable  Like many companies we got into the Series A crunch and we weren t able to raise more money  We simply weren t able to get dollars flowing from the marketplace to line up with our expense structure   Title  Zumbox to Shutter its Operations  Company  Zumbox  All of us at Zumbox remain committed to the concept of digital postal mail and have great confidence this capability will one day be the way you receive and manage your postal mail  However  at this point  the time and cost required to deliver on the vision is more than the market is prepared to invest   Title  Failed to delight  Post mortem of my first startup  Company  Delight  Customers pay for information  not raw data  Customers are willing to pay a lot more for information and most are not interested in data  Your service should make your customers look intelligent in front of their stakeholders  Follow up with inactive users  This is especially true when your service does not give intermediate values to your users  Our system should have been smarter about checking up on our users at various stages   Title  Mochi Media Winding Down Services  Company  Mochi Media  Nobody at Mochi wanted this to happen and there were parties interested in acquiring Mochi from them  including myself  for more than they d make by dissolving it  They re simply not interested in making a rational decision here  and they certainly don t care about you all like we do  past and present Mochi employees   We ve been trying to prevent this from happening for quite some time  but we failed to change their plans   Title  Salorix Shuts Operations  Company  Salorix  Unfortunately  all good things must come to an end and this one did  too  It is better to fail fast  than to have a slow death   Title  The last step  Company  HowDo  Our goal was now to transform that passion into a sustainable platform  We have failed to make this possible and without the resources needed for development  It has been a difficult decision to close the platform  made with every consideration of alternative ways to continue   Title  Epiloque  Company  Readmill  Many challenges in the world of ebooks remain unsolved  and we failed to create a sustainable platform for reading  Unfortunately  it is not possible to sell books on Apple s platform at a competitive price  We also considered the book subscription model but did not find it to be a viable option for us  Finally  even if all users paid for the app  it would not provide the necessary resources to sustain and develop it   Title  The Uphill Battle Of Social Event Sharing  A Post Mortem for Plancast  Company  Plancast  Social networks  by my general definition and among which I count Plancast  are essentially systems for distributing content among people who care about each other  and the frequency at which its users can share that content on a particular network is critical to how much value it ll provide them on an ongoing basis  Unlike other  more frequent content types such as status updates and photos  which can be shared numerous times per day   plans are suitable for only occasional sharing  Most people simply don t go to that many events  and of those they do attend  many are not anticipated with a high degree of certainty  As a result  users don t tend to develop a strong daily or weekly habit of contributing content   Original 51 Startup Post Mortems  Published January 20  2014   Title  7 Lessons I ve Learned From a Failed Startup  You Are MUCH More Resilient Than You Think Had someone told me I was going to work a night audit job  get 4 hours sleep a day  consult  and be part of a startup  I would have told them that they re crazy  I knew I was resilient  but this really pushed me to the next level  NEVER underestimate your capabilities   Title  7 Things I learned from Startup Failure  Company  Intellibank  Focus and simplicity are often more difficult to achieve than building features on top of features on top of features  As a result  too many startups are unfocused  The time required to trim back an idea is not insignificant   said best by Mark Twain   If I had more time  I would have written a shorter letter    Title  Startup Lessons Learned from My First Startup  Company  Teamometer   Don t  multiply big numbers Multiply  30 times 1 000 clients times 24 months  WOW  we will be rich  Oh  silly you  you have no idea how hard it is to get 1 000 clients paying anything monthly for 24 months  Here is my advice  get your first client  Then get your first 10  Then get more and more  Until you have your first 10 clients  you have proved nothing  only that you can multiply numbers   Title  A Postmortem Analysis of Standout Jobs  Company  Standout Jobs  I raised too much money  too early for Standout Jobs    1 8M   We didn t have the validation needed to justify raising the money we did  Part of the reason for this is that the founding team couldn t build an MVP on its own  That was a mistake  If the founding team can t put out product on its own  or with a small amount of external help from freelancers  they shouldn t be founding a startup  We could have brought on additional co founders  who would have been compensated primarily with equity versus cash  but we didn t   Title  Cusoy  A postmortem  Company  Cusoy  I didn t want a startup  but an actual business that generates revenue  and Cusoy would not fulfill that personal goal for me without a full time team  1 2  years of funding  multiple years of hard work  3 5  years at the very least   trying to answer the if when questions of whether or not Cusoy could make money  very expensive questions too  might I add   not only in money but time  my most valuable asset   While I know there might be a possibility I could hustle incredibly hard and try to set up partnerships  the time investment required far outweighed the already incredibly slim chances of generating revenue   Title  Flowtab  Company  Flowtab  We hired a local operations manager in Denver  Sasha Juliard  and soon launched at Shotgun Willie s  the highest grossing strip club in CO  and two other bars  We made about  1 200 on each deal  50  went to DexOne  we spent  800 on each launch event and we had  500 in hardware costs   this was the only sales revenue Flowtab ever made  We were tightening up our sales process  but it was hard to market ourselves properly in those bars without being there  It quickly become a distraction to our operations in San Francisco   Title  Formspring   A Postmortem  Company  Formspring  Entrepreneurs  build your product  not someone else s  The most successful products execute on a vision that aligns with their product s and users  goals  It s hard to put blinders on when your stats are slowly coming down and you see other startups skyrocketing around you with various tactics and strategies  For the love of god  put them on  It s the only way to build what you should instead of chasing others  ideas   Title  Internet Startup  Lessons from Failure  Product  Mass customized Jeans  We weren t going to draw from the business until we had recouped our  parents   initial investment  That meant continuing to operate 9 5 while earning an income at night  which was fine for the months leading up to launch  but totally unsustainable once orders started coming in   Title  Lessons from my failed startup  Company  Parceld  No one likes someone who is too aggressive  but looking back  my idea of  too aggressive  could probably fit very nicely into the  persistent  bucket  which  quite frankly  is not enough when raising money  My father told me that  especially as a woman  to never be afraid to ask for what I want or to remind others of their commitments  People these days are busy  forgetful and over scheduled  it s quite possible my three emails each got buried  so a fourth or fifth email  not daily  though  maybe weekly  would have served me well  I ll never know   Title  Lessons from my failed startup  Company  Saaspire  If you re bootstraping  cashflow is king  If you want to possibly build a product while your revenue is coming from other sources  you have to get those sources stable before you can focus on the product   Title  Looking back at 7 years with my startup GroupSpaces  Company  GroupSpaces   we most definitely committed the all too common sin of premature scaling  Driven by the desire to hit significant numbers to prove the road for future fundraising and encouraged by our great initial traction in the student market  we embarked on significant work developing paid marketing channels and distribution channels that we could use to demonstrate scalable customer acquisition  This all fell flat due to our lack of product market fit in the new markets  distracted significantly from product work to fix the fit  double fail  and cost a whole bunch of our runway   Title  My Startup Failed  F      Company  Zillionears com  More importantly though  people really didn t really LIKE anything about our product  No one that used the service thought it was that cool  In fact  some people that participated in the sale didn t even like our  dynamic pricing  system  They were trying to support the artist  so saving a few dollars didn t excite them  They could easily have just gotten his music for free elsewhere   Title  Out of the Picture  Why the world s best photo startup is going out of business  Editorial   Company  Everpix  The founders acknowledge they made mistakes along the way  They spent too much time on the product and not enough time on growth and distribution  The first pitch deck they put together for investors was mediocre  They began marketing too late  They failed to effectively position themselves against giants like Apple and Google  who offer fairly robust   and mostly free   Everpix alternatives  And while the product wasn t particularly difficult to use  it did have a learning curve and required a commitment to entrust an unknown startup with your life s memories   a hard sell that Everpix never got around to making much easier  Rimer put it a bit differently   Having a great product is not the only thing that ultimately makes a company successful    Title  Part Two of the HelloParking postmortem  a look back  and a new perspective  Company  HelloParking  But we never defined clear hypotheses  developed experiments  and we rarely had meaningful conversations with our target end users  And while we had some wonderful advisors in the parking industry  we should have met with everyone we could get our hands on  Worst  we rarely got out of the building   Title  Play By Your Own Rules  Company  Gowalla  Unfortunately  once your key metric is tied to cash value in the eyes of investors  it sucks to be number two  Your ceiling has been bolted in place  Your future capacity to raise cash or sell has a lid on it now  We felt that in order to survive we had to get our numbers up  We tried just about everything to juice growth  some ideas being more successful than others   Title  Postmortem of a Venture Backed Startup  Company  Sonar  We received conflicting advice from lots of smart people about which is more important  We focused on engagement  which we improved by orders of magnitude  No one cared  Lesson learned  Growth is the only thing that matters if you are building a social network  Period  Engagement is great but you aren t even going to get the meeting unless your top line numbers reach a certain threshold  which is different for seed vs  series A vs  selling advertising    Title  Postmortem of a Venture Backed  Acquired Startup  Company  Decide com  Decide how you want do things then hire people that want to do things that way  There s value in having a diversity of opinion but in a early stage startups  the benefits  moving fast  of hiring people that generally agree with you outweigh the benefits  diversity of opinion  of hiring people that don t  If you can t hire anyone that agrees with you  re evaluate how you want to do things   Title  Shnergle Post Mortem  Company  Shnergle  Does your idea only monetise at scale  If your idea can only be monetised at scale  head to San Francisco   Silicon Valley  There isn t enough risk capital  or enough risk appetite  in the UK EU venture market to pour capital into unproven R D concepts  If you want to build in the UK  find some way of charging money from day one  You can still use a freemium structure to up sell later  Shnergle was never going to monetise before it had scaled fairly significantly  Fail   Title  Tis the Season for a Tigerbow Post Mortem  Company  Tigerbow  Don t raise money from people who don t invest in startups  We raised a  comparatively  small amount of money from friends and family  For the most part they were very supportive  but there were exceptions  Aside from the fact that we got little  non monetary  value added from these investors  people who are unfamiliar with investing in startups and the risks and challenges of building a company will drive you bananas   Tempting  but don t   duh    Title  Travelllll Post Mortem  Company  Travelllll com  If your monetisation strategy is advertising  you need to be marketing to an enormous audience  It s possible to make a little money from a lot of people  or a lot of money from a few people  Making a little money from a few people doesn t add up  If you re not selling something  you better have a LOT of eyeballs  We didn t   Title  Vitoto Offically Shutting Down  Company  Vitoto  Product outside area of specialization  Nobody in the team had built a successful consumer product before  We all had experience in the enterprise space  selling to businesses  We had no experience in consumer of video  We were not playing to our strengths  Next time  Next time I will play in a space I have lived in before   Title  Why Startups Fail  A Postmortem For Flud  The Social Newsreader  Editorial   Company  Flud   We really didn t test the initial product enough   Ghoshal says  The team pulled the trigger on its initial launches without a significant beta period and without spending a lot of time running QA  scenario testing  task based testing and the like  When v1 0 launched  glitches and bugs quickly began rearing their head  as they always do   making for delays and laggy user experiences aplenty   something we even mentioned in our early coverage  Not giving enough time to stress and load testing or leaving it until the last minute is something startups are known for   especially true of small teams   but it means things tend to get pretty tricky at scale  particularly if you start adding a user every four seconds    Title  On Q ity  a Cancer Diagnostic Company  R I P   A VC s perspective   Company  On Q ity  Getting the technology right  but the market timing wrong  is still wrong  confirming cliche about the challenge of innovating  We may have been right that CTCs are  hot  and will be important in the future  but we certainly didn t have enough capital around the table to fund the story until the market caught up  It will be great in 5 10 years to see CTCs evolve as a routine part of cancer care  though clearly bittersweet for those of us involved with On Q ity   Title  How My Startup Failed  Product  Condom Key Chains  There was no doubt about it  I had discovered The Next Big Thing  Like Edison and the lightbulb  like Gates and the pc operating system  I would launch a revolution that would transform society while bringing me wealth and fame  I was about to become the first person in America to sell condom key chains   Title  Why Wesabe Lost to Mint  Company  Wesabe  Between the worse data aggregation method and the much higher amount of work Wesabe made you do  it was far easier to have a good experience on Mint  and that good experience came far more quickly  Everything I ve mentioned   not being dependent on a single source provider  preserving users  privacy  helping users actually make positive change in their financial lives   all of those things are great  rational reasons to pursue what we pursued  But none of them matter if the product is harder to use  since most people simply won t care enough or get enough benefit from long term features if a shorter term alternative is available   Title  ArsDigita   From Start up to Bust up  Company  ArsDigita  1  spent  20 million to get back to the same revenue that I had when I was CEO 2  declined Microsoft s offer  summer 2000  to be the first enterprise software company with a  NET product  a Microsoft employee came back from a follow up meeting with Allen and said  He reminds me of a lot of CEOs of companies that we ve worked with  that have gone bankrupt    3  deprecated the old feature complete product  ACS 3 4  before finishing the new product  ACS 4 x   note that this is a well known way to kill a company among people with software products experience  Informix self destructed because people couldn t figure out whether to run the old proven version 7 or the new fancy version 9 so they converted to Oracle instead   Title  RiotVine Post Mortem  Company  RiotVine  It s not about good ideas or bad ideas  it s about ideas that make people talk  And this worked really well for foursquare thanks to the mayorship  If I tell someone I m the mayor of a spot  I m in an instant conversation   What makes you the mayor    That s lame  I m there way more than you   What do you get for being mayor    Compare that to talking about Gowalla   I just swapped this sticker of a bike for a sticker of a six pack of beer  What  Yes  I am still a virgin   See the difference  Make some aspect of your product easy and fun to talk about  and make it unique   Title  The Last AnNounce r ment  Company  Nouncer  A month ago  half way through my angel funds raised from family members  I decided to review the progress I ve made and figure out what still needs to happen to make this a viable business  I was also actively pursuing raising VC funds with the help of a very talented and well connected friend  At the end  I asked myself what are the most critical resources I need to be successful and the answer was partners and developers  I ve been looking for both for about a year and was unable to find the right people  I realized that money was not the issue   Title  BricaBox  Goodbye World   Company  BricaBox  Go vest yourself  When a co founder walks out of a company   as was the case for me   you ve already been dealt a heavy blow  Don t exacerbate the issue by needing to figure out how to deal with a large equity deadweight on your hands  investors won t like that the  2 stakeholder is absent  even estranged  from your company   So  the best way of dealing with this issue is to take a long  long vesting period for all major sweat equity founders   Title  Boompa com Launch Postmortem  Part 1  Research  Picking a Team  Office Space and Money  Company  Boompa com  Ethan and I came up with the  Zombie Team  test for figuring out whether or not someone is ready to work on an intense project  be it a start up or otherwise  The test is this  If zombies suddenly sprung from the earth  could you trust the perspective team member to cover your back  Would they tell you if they got bit  Most importantly would you give them the team s only gun if you knew they were the better shot  If the answer is no to any of those questions you need to let them get eaten by the cubicle wasteland of corporate culture  because they aren t ready for this kind of work   Title  EventVue Post Mortem  Company  EventVue  Our Deadly Cultural Mistakes    didn t focus on learning   failing fast until it was too late   didn t care focus enough about discovering how to market eventvue   made compromises in early hiring decisions   choose expediency over talent competency  The market was not there  The thesis of our current business model  startups are all about testing theses  was that there was a need for video producers and content owners to make money from their videos  and that they could do that by charging their audience  We found both sides of that equation didn t really work  I validated this in my conversations with companies with more market reach than us  that had tried similar products  ppv video platform   but pulled the plug because they didn t see the demand for it  Video producers are afraid of charging for content  because they don t think people will pay  And they re largely right  Consumers still don t like paying for stuff  period  We did find some specific industry verticals where the model works  some high schools  some boxing and mixed martial arts events  some exclusive conferences   but not enough to warrant a large market and an independent company   Title  Leaving IonLab Company  IonLab  Second  as one of my friends observed  I talked to about 7 people  both acquaintances and friends  whose judgment I trusted  3 of them sympathized and agreed with my decision and 4 of them admonished me and asked me to  hang in there   You know what was the clincher  The first 3 had done startups themselves and the latter 4 had not  The latter 4 did not really understand the context  even though they meant well and are intelligent folks   Title  Lessons Learned  Company  Devver  The most significant drawback to a remote team is the administrative hassle  It s a pain to manage payroll  unemployment  insurance  etc in one state  It s a freaking nightmare to manage in three states  well  two states and a district   even though we paid a payroll service to take care of it  Apparently  once your startup gets larger  there are companies that will manage this with minimal hassle  but for a small team  it was a major annoyance and distraction   Title  Lessons from Kiko  web 2 0 startup  about Its Failure  Company  Kiko  Make an environment where you will be productive  Working from home can be convenient  but often times will be much less productive than a separate space  Also its a good idea to have separate spaces so you ll have some work life balance   Title  Lessons Learned  Startup Failure Part 1  Company  Overto  Thin line between life and death of internet service is a number of users  For the initial period of time the numbers were growing systematically  Then we hit the ceiling of what we could achieve effortlessly  It was a time to do some marketing  Unfortunately no one of us was skilled in that area  Even worse  no one had enough time to fill the gap  Title  Monitor110  A Post Mortem  A VC s perspective  Company  Monitor110  The Seven Deadly Sins While we certainly made more than seven mistakes during the nearly four year life of Monitor110  I think these top the list  1  The lack of a single   the buck stops here  leader until too late in the game 2  No separation between the technology organization and the product organization 3  Too much PR  too early 4  Too much money 5  Not close enough to the customer 6  Slow to adapt to market reality 7  Disagreement on strategy both within the Company and with the Board  Title  Why We Shut NewsTilt Down  Company  NewsTilt  None of these problems should have been unassailable  which leads us to why NewsLabs failed as a company    Nathan and I had major communication problems    we weren t intrinsically motivated by news and journalism    making a new product required changes we could not make    our motivation to make a successful company got destroyed by all of the above  Title  Aftermath Company  Diffle  For anyone faced with winding down a company  I d highly recommend taking a while off before making any big decisions  and not just the two and a half weeks that I d initially tried  You re not thinking straight when your startup dies   your perspective may be a bit different in a few months  as might your preferences for what you want to do next  The corollary to that is to wind up your startup before you re totally out of money  so that you have options for what to do next and don t have to bargain from a place of total weakness   Title  6 reasons why my VC funded startup did fail Product  Link Management System  So the most important thing is to sell   a fact lots of startups forget  And we did too  After much thought it comes down to these six reasons why we failed  beside the obvious one that the VC market imploded when we needed money and noone was able to get any funding   1  We didn t sell anything 2  We didn t sell anything 3  We didn t sell anything 4  The market window was not yet open 5  We focused too much on technology 6  We had the wrong business model  Title  10 Lessons from a Failed Startup  Company  PlayCafe  I would advise any entrepreneur or investor considering content to think twice  as Howard Lindzon from Wallstrip warned us  Content is an order of magnitude harder than technology with an order less upside  no YouTube producer will earn within a hundredth of  1 65 billion  This will only become more true as DVRs and media sharing reduce revenues and pay for performance ads eliminate inefficient ad spend  of which there is a lot  The main and perhaps only reason to do content should be the love of creating it  Title  Lessons from our Failed Startup Company  SMSnoodle  I have been hearing this advise from the time I have been in my mother s womb  Dont take this easily If you are a techie there are more chances that you won t follow this advise  Your heart doesn t get satisfied with any levels of development Ignore your heart  Listen to your brain  If you are a web startup   you can take max 6 months to release your first version  for something like mint com   Simpler websites shouldn t take more than 2 3 months You can always iterate and extrapolate later  Wet your feet asap  Title  Untitled Partners Post Mortem Company  Untitled Partners  Hiring is hard  and without proper experience  we should have leaned more heavily on our investors to help us with this decision  Hiring was a challenge we found difficult throughout the life of our Company  We made as many bad decisions as we did good ones with regard to hiring full time  part time  and independent contractors consultants  Biggest takeaway  As soon as the data starts to suggest someone might be the wrong hire  don t wait  immediately start recruiting a replacement  and upgrade as soon as possible  Title  Key Lessons from Cryptine Networks  Failure Company  Cryptine Networks  No matter how close of friends  how much you trust each other or how good your intentions are money comes between people and everyone over estimates their own contributions  Furthermore  founders become highly emotional about their companies  Thus  the process of negotiating taking back stock from founders is not rational and inherently very difficult  However  vesting schedules reduce the difficult negotiation to simply and mechanically exercising the companies pre agreed right to repurchase stock at the price it was issued  I foolishly let myself fall into the  it won t happen to me  trap but no startup gets it right on the first try and theses hiccups often lead to changes in the team  Believing that any startup won t have to deal with stock vesting issues is totally unrealistic  Title  Imercive Post Mortem Company  Imercive  For one  we stuck with the wrong strategy for too long  I think this was partly because it was hard to admit the idea wasn t as good as I originally thought or that we couldn t make it work  If we had been honest with ourselves earlier on we may have been able to pivot sooner and have enough capital left to properly execute the new strategy  I believe the biggest mistake I made as CEO of imercive was failing to pivot sooner  Title  Meetro Post Mortem Company  Meetro  aka Lefora   We could have gone about trying to fix Meetro but the team was just ready to move on  Raising money on the flat growth we had was nearly impossible  Plus I knew that in order to keep the tight knit team we had built together  we needed to shift focus for sanity sake  People  myself included  just felt beat up  We knew that fixing these issues would involve a complete rearchitecturing of the code  and people just weren t excited about the idea enough anymore to do it right  Title  Post Mortem on a Failed Product Company  eCrowds  As the product became more and more complex  the performance degraded  In my mind  speed is a feature for all web apps so this was unacceptable  especially since it was used to run live  public websites  We spent hundreds of hours trying to speed of the app with little success  This taught me that we needed to having benchmarking tools incorporated into the development cycle from the beginning due to the nature of our product  Title  Hubris  ambition and mismanagement  the first post mortem of RealTime Worlds  Editorial  Company  RealTime Worlds  Dave Jones made a virtue of having no business model for APB  He said  if a game is built around a business model  that s a recipe for failure   Bullsh1t  Title  A Startup Idea Postmortem  Proof That Good Ideas Aren t Always Good Business Company  Q A Service But the more we moved down the path  the more I realized the complexities involved with selling answers  Knowledge is a tricky thing to sell  because even experts disagree on some answers  What s worse  most people think they know more than they really do  Look at how many idiots think they know stocks  or programming  or even business  Nearly everyone thinks they can give good management tips  It is difficult to sell something so  confusing  and we realized it would lead to problems down the road  Yahoo  and most of the other sites  fix this by having people vote on the best answer  but we couldn t post answers in public because that would take away our residual incentives  And anyway  I m not convinced in the  wisdom of crowds  for anything beyond general knowledge  It doesn t work for domain specific stuff  Title  Co Founder Potts Shares Lessons Learned from Backfence Bust Company  Backfence Hyper local is really hard  Don t kid yourself  You don t just open the doors and hit critical mass  We knew that from the jump  It takes a lot of work to build a community  Look carefully at most hyper local sites and see just how much posting is really being done  especially by members of the community as opposed to be the sites  operators  Anybody who s run a hyper local site will tell you that it takes a couple of years just to get to a point where you ve truly got a vibrant online community  It takes even longer to turn that into a viable business  Unfortunately  for a variety of reasons  Backfence was unable to sustain itself long enough to reach that point  Title  What an Entrepreneur Learned from His Failed Startup  Interview  Company  Sedna Wireless Finances were just one part of the story  The other part was that we failed to execute our own plans  Both external factors  e g  the hardware ecosystem in India  and internal reasons  e g  the expertise of

stage companies acquire users and grow their social communities  In this article  he examines some of the big mistakes startups must avoid   I ve spent 10 times more time with early stage founders than I have with my friends and family in the last year  I ve coached over 50 entrepreneurs  mentored or given talks to thousands of early stage entrepreneurs at places like SXSW and Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center in San Francisco  put on a conference attended by hundreds of founders  run an agency whose main clients are startups and written a step by step guide to growth hacking   Between all of this  and teaching and giving classes on digital marketing and content marketing at General Assembly  here are some mistakes I see founders make extremely often  leading them into the deadzone of not being able to raise money make revenue properly launch their company   1  Not focusing on product or market fit Not talking to users enough  Only two things matter on day one of your company  Product development and customer development  Speak to potential customers users every day to find out if you re focusing on a problem that s worth solving  how they currently solve this problem what they think of your product etc  Then put that learning directly into the product  with weekly deadlines  Which brings us on to   2  Outsourcing tech building their product  Tech products require constant changes  If you outsource the making of your app product to someone else  particularly someone working remotely  it makes it extremely difficult to quickly make changes  work crazy hours to get it complete on time etc  I hear horror story after horror story from startups who have tried to do this  The finished product doesn t match your vision  and now it s a big  expensive hassle to fix   3  Non technical CEO not being head of growth  It s a really bad thing if you re the CEO and can t code  believe me  I know   You need to OWN getting users customers through the door  The number of founders I speak to with no growth plan is shocking  A good plan where you get everything wrong is fine  but too many founders have woeful user acquistion ideas riddled with potential failure points  and nothing approaching a concrete plan  If you re not doing this  what do you do all day  Which brings us on to   4  Whenever I hear a founder say  hopefully   they re normally in trouble  99 times out of 100 This word signifies you don t know what you re doing  haven t really thought things through  or can t be bothered to go deeper to win   5  No attempt at differentiation no secret sauce  Your company either needs to do something not many people are doing  or it should have some secret weapon in a crowded market which will mean you win  ideally both   Some examples of secret sauce  Intense industry knowledge background  serious industry contacts  an interesting user acquisition method channel   6  Looking for Investment way too early  Surprisingly common  this one  You need traction  team and product  to get funded quickly  If one or two sides of these triangle are really strong  you can get funded within a few months  If you don t have any  it will be virtually impossible  The easiest win if you want investment is to get traction  If you have a lot of traffic signups  you can do without most of the other things  as you are evidently building something people want  Likewise   7  Trying to monetize too early  When you have only 50 people who have just started using the first version of your app product and you want to start charging them  10  a month  you re going to suddenly need a hell of a lot of paid users out of nowhere to pay the wages  It s hard enough to get people to use try things for free   8  No internal viral growth engine  This comes after product market fit  but this is seriously underlooked in most companies I speak to  How can one user invite others  What discount or free trial can be extended if people invite others  It is VERY HARD to get users  So if those users you get don t invite others  it s going to be very hard to scale   9  Not getting enough feedback asking difficult questions  There are office hours where you can speak to investors everywhere  and so many ways pitching events you can get feedback at  you have no excuse to not get feedback from smart people  Here are some questions I never hear early stage founders ask   Why do you think my idea won t work     what do you think will be our biggest challenge    and my personal favourite if you re speaking to a potential partner investor   Why wouldn t you invest in us    You need to ask the questions that scare you  As a sidenote  I d generally recommend if this is your first company that you apply to some accelerators  This will get you to these questions quickly if you make it to the admission interviews   10  Being all talk  Early stage founders love to post  hustle  quotes on their social networks  but when it comes down to it  too many have excuses for not executing  Normal excuses  Don t have the money to make it happen  don t have the time  got sidetracked  You need to ask yourself every day how much you want it  Would you move back in with your parents  Would you give up seeing your friends or drinking  Would you change your diet  sleep pattern and addiction to your smartphone Netflix and chill  Ultimately  will you give up your excuses  If you can  your business has a chance  Always ask yourself this   How are the people who are successful managing it   There s always a way  if you want it   11  Not knowing their space competitors  This happens surprisingly often  Someone is building a piece of software and you ask them  How is it different from  large competitor   and they tell you they haven t heard of them  Ah   Ultimately  try and hammer out any naivety you re carrying  This is one of the biggest killers of early stage companies  The good news is  once you understand what not to do  you re ahead of the competition  As Omar Little once said in The Wire   The game is out there  and it s either play or get played,"[958 1258 569 759 611 626 1110 486 754 937 377]"
1076,training-dataset/business/302.txt,business,A Dozen Lessons about Minimum Viable Products It s only cheap to build 2 3 person companies with sweat equity  The minute you start paying engineers you will realize it is quite expensive   Bill Gurley  Assume a startup has raised a seed round of   2 million  Also assume that what the startup has is a hypothesis that a big market composed of dogs will want to eat the dog food described by the hypothesis  The founders of the startup have no proof that their hypothesis is true  but some investors have voted with their money that there is significant hope that the startup s hypothesis is correct  Every penny of the  2 million raised by the startup is precious  If the startup runs out of cash it is dead  since that is the only unforgivable sin in business  Now let s look at the overall context in which this is happening  The odds that the startup will be financially successful are  simply put  not good  How many startups raise a seed round  There is no way to know for sure since many startups at seed stage live and die and don t leave a trace that can be tracked  Reported seed stage startups typically number about 1 200 in a given a quarter  plus or minus a couple of hundred  depending upon the business climate  Assuming  5 000 seed stage startups a year both reported and unreported  only 800 of them raised a Series A round in 2016 says Mattermark  That s about an 84  fatality rate just at seed stage  Mattermark also calculates the odds of survival here at far less than 10   This calculation is based simply on a startup not getting to the next phase   Other research  which uses different definitions  concludes   About 75  of U S  venture backed start ups fail  according to Harvard Business School senior lecturer Shikhar Ghosh  Ghosh s research estimates 30  to 40  of high potential start ups end up liquidating all assets a failure by any definition  But if a start up failure is defined as not delivering the projected return on investment  then 95  of VC companies are failures  Ghosh said   Being a founder or early employee of a startup is not a rational act given the odds of success  Of course  as George Bernard Shaw wrote in Man and Superman   all progress depends on the unreasonable  human being    The reason why books like The Hard Thing about Hard Things by Ben Horowitz and Shoe Dog by Phil Knight resonate so strongly with people who have been involved in startups is that they accurately describe the terror  inevitable setbacks and daily struggle of life in a startup business  not just the seemingly glamorous parts      If you create something and no one uses it  you re dead  Nothing else you do is going to matter if people don t like your product   Jessica Livingston  The first rule of startups is that without making something that people want to buy  you re dead  The second rule is that you should not forget the first rule  Particularly when the odds of survival are low in an activity  it pays to be very aware of methods that can increase the probability of survival  Michael Mauboussin s advice should be front and center in every founder s mind   If you compete in a field where luck plays a role  you should focus more on the process of how you make decisions   What should that process be for a startup  In thinking about the right process it is wise not to forget that the startup s goal is to establish product market fit before they run out of money  Unfortunately  at the very early stages of the startup s existence it faces many challenges related to at least one untested hypothesis   Hypothesis   of course  is just a fancy word for  guess   Steve Anderson the founder of the seed stage venture capital firm Baseline Ventures points out   Generally speaking  most of my investments are pre product launch   they re just an idea  My goal as an investor is to make sure there s enough financing to give companies time to do that  a year to 18 months  The worst scenario is to try to raise more money when you haven t achieved that goal  If you don t have it  eventually you ll run out of cash  say the experiment is wrong  and fold up your tent  That s why when I invest I want to leave enough room for pivoting or reexamining your goals   Making matters even more challenging for the early stage startup is the point Ev Williams makes here   You know that old saw about a plane flying from California to Hawaii being off course 99  of the time but constantly correcting  The same is true of successful startups except they may start out heading toward Alaska     A full executive team with a salesforce and all that stuff before you have a killer product is a complete waste of time   Marc Andreessen  A startup should defer spending time and energy proving and developing its growth hypothesis until it has established the value hypothesis  I have recently written a blog post on precisely this  first value THEN growth  point here  The key point in that post is made by Andy Rachleff   A value hypothesis identifies the features you need to build  the audience that s likely to care  and the business model required to entice a customer to buy your product  Companies often go through many iterations before they find product market fit  if they ever do   When the startup is still searching for the elements of its value hypothesis  money and time spent on growing the business is a bonfire of cash generating zero value  The early days of the life of a startup are focused on  search  rather than  execution  advises Steve Blank  a serial entrepreneur  professor and author who is justifiably famous in the startup world    The minimum viable product  MVP  is that product which has just those features  and no more  that allows you to ship a product that resonates with early adopters  some of whom will pay you money or give you feedback    The lesson of the MVP is that any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste  no matter how important it might have seemed at the time   Eric Ries  The goal of the MVP process is to validate the hypothesis in a speedy and cost efficient manner  The key word in this quote from Ries above is feedback since that is how anyone learns  The most effective processes are based on feedback loops which are in turn based on the scientific method  build  measure  learn  What the startup offers as its MVP should be compete in what it does to deliver and capture value  not a fully complete implementation of the vision  The MVP is an experiment that is intended to generate validated learning about what customers value enough to pay for  An MVP approach is not the only way to go forward with a startup  Eric Ries describes two extreme alternatives    One  which I call maximizing chance of success  says  Look  we only got one chance at this so let s get it right   We re going to ship it when it s right and that actually is perfectly rational  If you only have one shot  you want to take the best shot you can and build the most perfect product you can  The issue is  of course  you know  you can spend  I don t know  say five years of stealth R D building a product you think customers want and then discover to your chagrin that they don t  The other possible extreme approach is to say   Well  let s just do  release early  release often   This approach is   Look  we ll just throw whatever crap we have out there and then we ll hear what customers say and we ll do whatever they say   But the issue there is if you show a product to three customers  you get 30 opinions  and now what do you do  So minimum viable product is kind of a synthesis of those two possible extremes     As you consider building your own minimum viable product  let this simple rule suffice  remove any feature  process  or effort that does not contribute directly to the learning you seek    If you want to do minimum viable product  you have to be prepared to iterate  And so you have to have the courage to say   Yeah  we ll ship something  get negative feedback and respond    Eric Ries  A minimum feature set is not a goal but a tactic to create cost effective and speedy validated learning about the hypothesis  The goal is to learn and steer based on feedback rather than try to predict and emerge with a killer fully formed product  Some people like Peter Thiel who is quoted just below  have a different view    Even in engineering driven Silicon Valley  the buzzwords of the moment call for building a  lean startup  that can  adapt  and  evolve  to an ever changing environment  Would be entrepreneurs are told that nothing can be known in advance  we re supposed to listen to what customers say they want  make nothing more than a  minimum viable product   and iterate our way to success  But leanness is a methodology  not a goal  Making small changes to things that already exist might lead you to a local maximum  but it won t help you find the global maximum  You could build the best version of an app that lets people order toilet paper from their iPhone  But iteration without a bold plan won t take you from 0 to 1  A company is the strangest place of all for an indefinite optimist  why should you expect your own business to succeed without a plan to make it happen  Darwinism may be a fine theory in other contexts  but in startups  intelligent design works best    Thiel or an entrepreneur like Elon Musk are not as capital constrained as the typical seed stage startup  They can afford to adopt what Ries called a  maximizing the chance of success  approach  Thiel in particular makes many bets and is nicely hedged since he owns a portfolio of wagers  In contrast the founders and early employees of a startup typically have all their eggs on one basket  The founders and early employees are far from hedged  What is right for Thiel may not be right for founders or early employees for that reason    An MVP is a process that you repeat over and over again  Identify your riskiest assumption  find the smallest possible experiment to test that assumption  and use the results of the experiment to course correct   Yevgeniy Brikman  The MVP process is depicted as a flywheel or loop for a reason  Most of the time actual testing of a hypothesis will reveal that customers do not value the product or even the vision the product represents  If the hypothesis is not validated by the experiment the business must iterate by replacing the hypothesis or shut down  I like this description of the process from an interview of Steve Blank by Chris Dixon    An MVP is really just a tool for discovering a scalable business model through customer development  An MVP should have the smallest possible feature set that creates gains for customers and reduces pain but it can t be so small that customers have nothing to evaluate  In other words  an MVP gives startup entrepreneurs something to demonstrate when they get out of the building and talk to current and potential customers about what they really need     The worst fate of any shipping of any product is that nobody cares  You don t get any feedback at all  That s what most features or most products do  They re just dead weight   Eric Ries  What Ries says here is an unfortunate fact  Chamath Palihapitiya describes reality bluntly   Core product value is really illusive and most products don t have any   Faced with the reality of shutting down many companies just push the button and start working on the growth hypothesis without having solved the value hypothesis  starting a process in which they will usually fly the business at high speed into the side of a mountain    The common phrase that most people use today is  You should build a minimum viable product   And I underlined viable because I think a lot of people skip that part and they go out with a feature and the whole user experience in the very beginning is flat  Minimal viable product pretty much means what is the smallest feature set that you should build to solve the problem that you are trying to solve  I think if you go through the whole story boarding experience you can kind of figure that out very quickly  But again  you have to be talking to users  you have to be seeing what exists out there already  and what you should be building should solve their immediate needs   Sam Altman  The graphics which best describe what Altman is talking about depict the MVP as being complete in terms of what it does but not as complete as it will eventually be in implementing the vision once the feedback is obtained from early adopter customers    A minimum viable product is not always a smaller cheaper version of your final product    Launching a new enterprise whether it s a tech start up  a small business  or an initiative within a large corporation has always been a hit or miss proposition  According to the decades old formula  you write a business plan  pitch it to investors  assemble a team  introduce a product  and start selling as hard as you can  All MBA tools are irrelevant on a startup s day one  This wrong belief is based on that we can start absolutely any company just by spending a lot of time on writing complicated operating plan and financial model and then hire people to execute this plans  But now we know that no plan survives first contact with customers  First days of startup are completely unpredictable  Business plans and financial forecasts are just silly as it was in the Soviet Union   Steve Blank  A classic example of a MVP is what was done by Zappos Founder Nick Swinmurn   My Dad told me  you know I think the one you should focus on is the shoe thing  That s a real business that makes sense  So I said okay  focused on the shoe thing  went to a couple of stores  took some pictures of the shoes  made a website  put them up and told the shoe store  if I sell anything  I ll come here and pay full price  They said okay  knock yourself out  So I did that  made a couple of sales   If you can validate your thesis without paying to create lots of code that approach is like found gold  As another example  the MVP for AngelList mostly took the form of making introductions by email  The Virgin Airlines MVP was just a single plane flying back and forth between two cities  The less money spent on proving the hypothesis  the more money that is left to pivot or execute on the idea    A MVP is not just a product with half of the features chopped out  or a way to get the product out the door a little earlier  And it s not something you build only once  and then consider the job done   Yevgeniy Brikman  The MVP should deliver value to the customer even though it is not as complete at is could be  Some people argue that an MVP can be as simple as a landing page  but I am skeptical  Eric Ries writes   The idea of minimum viable product is useful because you can basically say  our vision is to build a product that solves this core problem for customers and we think that for the people who are early adopters for this kind of solution  they will be the most forgiving  And they will fill in their minds the features that aren t quite there if we give them the core  tent pole features that point the direction of where we re trying to go     MVP is quite annoying  because it imposes extra overhead  We have to manage to learn something from our first product iteration  In a lot of cases  this requires a lot of energy invested in talking to customers or metrics and analytics  Second  the definition s use of the words maximum and minimum means it is decidedly not formulaic  It requires judgment to figure out  for any given context  what MVP makes sense   Eric Ries  It does not make much sense to build a MVP unless you do the work to collect data about the experiments and conduct an analysis using modern tools  This data collection and analysis is a lot of work and is not as

1110,training-dataset/business/986.txt,business,Turning Your Startup into a BusinessIn this guest blog post  Shawn Parrotte  Marketing Manager at Designli and friend of the Founder Institute  explains the difference between traction and growth  as well as how founders can turn their company into a viable business   Start ups are unique because of their ability to scale exceptionally fast  Think about this  of those companies that make up the unicorn club   with a  1B  valuation   it took them on average only six years to get there  By leveraging technology and honing in on the drivers of their success  these organizations were able to fundamentally change entire industries   Now  whether or not you have dreams of building a billion dollar company  transforming your startup from just an idea into a successful business means that your company will typically go through three stages   traction  transition  and growth   Each of these stages requires different priorities that are reflected in different company goals  metrics  channels  teams  and so on   In the early stages of your startup  you ll have to manage so many tasks that you ll often be overwhelmed with what needs to get done  But instead of being paralyzed by what appears like an endless amount of work  know that you really only have one goal  traction   Before traction  everything else is secondary  Only once you have significant traction should you move your organization to the next stage  transition  towards your final destination  growth   Understanding how these two terms  traction and growth  are related to each other  as well as the key differences between them  is essential for building a successful long term business   What Is Traction   Simply put  traction refers to the initial progress of a startup and the momentum it builds as it grows  When you have  traction   you have a clear indicator that your product or service is viable  that you ve found some level of product market fit  you re getting attention from your target audience  and you re growing your brand   There are many ways of measuring traction  Depending on what kind of startup you have and which industry you re in  you don t necessarily need to be profitable to show signs of traction  Just look at Twitter  it s a 10 years old company that has a massive user base  and its still experimenting with how transform into a profitable company   If you re a Saas  or social media driven startup  maintaining consistent growth in other metrics besides profit such as daily active users  monthly active users  monthly signups  or a decrease in churn rate are all indicators that your startup is gaining traction   And just as traction is important to you  it is important to potential investors as well  Needless to say  your startup will attract more investors if it has greater evidence of traction  With more investors  your company will get more funds and a bigger network  both of which will help your startup grow   One of the first steps in generating traction is finding what the real drivers of your business growth are   which may take some time to discover   and developing processes to maximize each driver  For instance  NerdWallet found that SEO was their go to driver of business growth  Once they realized this was the most effective strategy  the team launched an initiative to write 500 posts per month and now they consistently rank on the first page of Google for pretty much anything and everything related to personal finance   When you have clearly defined processes and goals  potential investors will also have a better picture of how your startup will progress in relation to your competition  if you have any  as well as the general landscape of the marketplace   What is Growth   Now let s talk about growth   If you did everything right in the traction stage  you ll have significant upward movement in the important metrics that drive your business  Here  you should start seeing signs that your business has gained market share in your industry and mindshare from your target audience  If you haven t yet  keep focusing on gaining traction before trying to scale your efforts   While being nimble allowed you to experiment during the early days of your startup   finding what moves the needle of your initial growth  testing different offerings  and nailing down your product market fit   when you re growing  your mission is to maximize what makes you unique and what makes you valuable   When you know what s working in your business  you can now hire experts to do it better and more efficiently for you  Or  if you neglected your product in favor of generating traffic  you can now circle back to craft a better product or a better user customer experience   Essentially  at the growth stage  you ll be able to work more on your business than in your business  Your team will start to take over most of the responsibilities which makes it easier for you to come into your role as leader in your company  Of course  you will still be much involved in everything  but you ll have a bit more room for crafting strategic vision  standardize processes  and efficiently utilizing your team member s strengths according to your goals and company objectives   How to go from Traction to Growth  The statistics for startup success are cruel  As many studies report  9 out of 10 startups fail  There could be many reasons for the failure  however  the main one is simply not having enough customers  In his book  Traction  Gabriel Weinberg hit the nail on the head by saying   Almost every failed startup has a product  What failed startups don t have are enough customers    To successfully get traction for your startup  there needs to be proper planning in place to grow over time  In this section  we will discuss few of the techniques that 10  of the startups  the successful ones  are using   In Person Networking  Networking is an effective activity for driving engagement at the beginning of your start up s journey  Use your personal connections to spread the word about what your company is up to  You ll then be able to meet potential customers or clients to gather more information about how your startup can add value to their lives  You can also look for people willing to mentor you that may be able to help you with any business questions or connect you to other important people  You can also go to conferences to speak or to see what your competition is up to  Get out there and be the voice of your company   SEO  Create relevant  high value content aimed at what people are searching for in your niche  Spend the time crafting content that s optimized for search so Google s algorithm knows how to serve it to people looking for what you offer  Always focus on content that audience finds useful  it s a proven way to get people share your content  visit and link back to your website   Besides having a great content  here are some more tips that will surely make you more attractive to Google   Your design is user friendly and works on mobile devices  Your website is fast loading  Your domain is getting backlinks from a variety of high authority sources  Email Campaigns  Email will always be around  so it s an integral part of generating traction  Social media platforms may come and go  however  email has still remained constant throughout  and according to many business managers  it s more effective when it comes to generating traffic   Cultivate an email list so you can communicate directly with your customers  You ll be able to keep them in the know about what your startup is doing and ask them directly about what you can do to better to serve them   Social Media  Social media marketing is another great way to generate traction for your startup  While it may be tempting  because it s so easy  to jump on every platform you can  it may not be the most effective  Before signing up for any of them  even mainstays such as Facebook and LinkedIn  create a strategy for how you will use each platform and connect with your target audience   You may want to opt for Medium and Quora over Twitter and YouTube  because your potential customers might frequent those places and not really ever make their way to the others   Feel free to explore though  because you never know if there may be a hidden pocket of people that would love to connect with your startup  Facebook groups and Linkedin groups  and are great examples  as are lesser known social media sites like ello co and musical ly          The bottom line is that generating traction is a challenging stage in any startup s life  It eventually turns into growth of your business  which in turn is a great indicator of the value your company  You can achieve traction through various means by developing dedicated strategies like  email marketing  social media marketing  and telling people about your startup in person  Needless to say  you do need a solid product that people genuinely want to use  If you ve got that  you need to get out there and make some moves so you can graduate from a startup to a successful business   Creatively Bold  Humbly

1172,training-dataset/business/384.txt,business,Don t Build a Business Unless You re Ready to Give Your AllAdeo Ressi  the co founder and CEO of the Founder Institute  is a major proponent of perseverence as an entrepreneurial virtue  Because so many aspiring founders  unfortunately  believe that launching a company is easy and is an effective means to gain money and fame  Adeo  along with those of the rest of us at the Founder Institute  have set out to prove that only the most passionate  dedicated  and resourceful will have what it takes to survive in the startup world   Adeo recently wrote an article about the topic of commitment in the Forbes article   A Business Is Not Worth Building Unless You Are Ready To  Go All In    Below are some of the key points   I ve started 9 businesses and have invested all of my time  all of my network  and most of my money into each and every one of them  Most have done well and others have failed  but I wouldn t advise an entrepreneur trying to build an impactful company to pursue any other strategy   Here s why   1  Building an Impactful Company Requires 100  of Your Time  I am always surprised by how many founders tell me things like  I can t quit my job to build this business until I get some funding   This line of thinking of completely backwards  and naive  What investor in their right mind would take the risk of investing in your company if you  the founder  won t even take on the risk of future earnings to devote your time to it  Realistically  the founders that tell me this are hundreds of steps away from getting investment   but even then  do they really expect talented people to go out on a limb to join their team full time if they re not willing to do the same  Unless you have an amazing track record in entrepreneurship  this is non negotiable   To be clear  I am not saying that a business can t begin as a  side project   On the contrary  I believe starting a  side project  before fully committing is the absolute best way to start a company  When it is just a  project   not a  business    you aren t too attached to it  and you can look at things objectively while testing the idea with customers  researching the economics  and getting feedback from experts   However  once you have put in several months  at least  and have gotten the proper validation  you need to devote 100  of your time to build the business if you want to have any chance of success  Realistically  this means 60  hours per week for several years   2  Building an Impactful Company Requires 100  of Your Network  If you are trying to build something of impact  then you need to quickly get comfortable with asking your friends  family  and colleagues for favors  These favors include  but are not limited to  sharing your news  giving you feedback on your product  providing introductions  handing over money  buying your product  investing in your company   and more   As awkward as this may seem  there is really no getting around it  As an early stage entrepreneur you usually have no tangible product to sell  so all you can sell is a vision or idea  This is actually very similar to a politician starting a  movement    and a  movement  requires an initial audience to get it going   To force this thinking on early stage entrepreneurs that are not quite ready to go  all in   in the first week of the Founder Institute we mandate that our founders create a mailing list of at least 20 friends  family members  and associates  After sending an initial introductory email where people can silently opt out  the founders then send this mailing list business updates and requests for feedback on a weekly basis  To push things further  we even require our founders to add people to the list every week  and when they finish our program they have over 125 subscribed contacts that they know personally or met in the program   Is this overkill  To be honest  when we first implemented this strategy the required subscriber numbers were much lower  However  over time we have moved the requirements higher and higher because it has be so effective  At the end of the day  this simple mailing list has acted as a forcing function that not only gets our founders comfortable with selling to personal acquaintances  but also provides them with a wide net of people from which to get valuable feedback  spread news  and more   If you are not comfortable asking friends  family and colleagues for favors related to your business  then I suggest you do something similar  Trying to build your company alone is usually a fool s errand   3  Building an Impactful Company Might Require All of Your Own Money  It does not always require 100  of your money  like numbers 1 and 2 above  but it might   This is what startup people call  skin in the game   Joining  investing in  or partnering with a startup is always a question of risk management  and the most remedial question someone can ask to mitigate risk before working with you is  Are you committed     There is a difference between interest and commitment  When you re interested in something  you do it only when it s convenient  When you re committed to something  you accept no excuses  only results     Kenneth H  Blanchard  Author of The One Minute Manager   Most of the successful entrepreneurs you read about today have invested most of their money into their businesses at the early stage  while also taking either a very low or the legal minimum salary for the first several years  I have done the same with all nine of my businesses   Obviously not everyone has the luxury to do this  but at the very least  they should expect to front the initial costs of the business  incorporation  legal  basic technology materials  and the like   while also offering much higher salaries to their first key hires than their own  After all   what signifies more commitment from the founder than cold hard cash   Okay  so let s say you have read my three points above but are still wavering and not quite ready to go  all in  with your time  network  or money  What should you do   At the very least  I recommend that you take a step back and ask yourself two key questions   Am I fully committed to this idea   If you are ready to go all in but do not believe you have validated your idea  you can usually find the answer by  1  isolating your area of concern   2  getting feedback on it through a well constructed  MVP Test  with a few hundred more potential customers  and  3  reviewing the results with someone that successfully built a business targeting the same customer  If you are not sold after that  then it s time to significantly alter   pivot   your idea  or start over altogether  Keep in mind that this is not a bad thing   it is better you learn this sooner rather than later   Am I ready for the rigors of starting a business   If you believe you have validated your idea but are still not ready to go all in  then work backwards and create a plan that will get you to that point  Maybe you have a child on the way  or other family obligations on the horizon  Maybe you need to save up money and start another  side hustle  in the interim  Or  maybe you need to take time creating relationships that will be crucial for your business to succeed  Whatever the situation  just create an actionable plan to get you there as quickly as possible  I promise you that the longer you wait  the more your chances of getting started and succeeding diminish    Business woman looking at road that goes up in the sky concept

1203,training-dataset/business/608.txt,business,The Startup Pivot PyramidIn 2011 we raised  2M from some of the top investors in Silicon Valley  Our startup  SocialWire  later renamed Manifest   helped online retailers instantly personalize the shopping experience when their customers signed in with Facebook  However   we soon learned that it was hard to convince the big retailers to add our product recommendations to their websites which they ve been optimizing for years  We also found that not enough customers wanted to sign in with Facebook while they were shopping online to get a more personalized experience   With most of our  2M still in the bank  and a technology that was good at matching Facebook users to the right products  we decided to pivot on the problem we were solving for the same customer and rebuild our product  Instead of generating product recommendations using Facebook   we would dynamically generate personalized product ads on Facebook  This new direction resonated with online retailers and the company was eventually acquired by Rakuten   Searching for Product Market Fit  Finding product market fit is hard  Most companies fail while searching for it  Marc Andreessen  in his 2011 essay  introduced the term as a moment in your startup s journey where things start to work  More and more customers demand your product and you achieve sustainable growth   Most successful companies go through several pivots to find product market fit  What makes it work is usually not one major pivot  but a series of experiments across customers  problem  product  technology and growth channels  Is there a process for entrepreneurs to experiment across these areas of their business in an efficient way   Growth marketers already figured this out  Great growth people are not necessarily the most knowledgeable marketers   they approach marketing like scientists  They have a thesis on how their idea  e g  new advertising channel  will lead to growth  they run the experiment  look at the data and if the experiment is successful   they make it repeatable  I strongly suggest you read this by Brian Balfour  check out this talk and spend time on growthhackers com to understand the growth experimentation process   But growth experimentation is the tip of the iceberg   that is your startup  How can entrepreneurs apply this process of experimentation to other areas of their business  and pivot to find product market fit   Introducing the Pivot Pyramid  Enter the Pivot Pyramid  It is a visual guideline to help founders make changes and run experiments in different areas of their business to drive growth  As investors  this is similar to how we ask questions and evaluate your startup  As founders  you could use the same guideline to come up with ideas or pivot your startup   Customers  Customers are the foundation of your startup  The problem you solve  the product you build  and the technology it s built with   all depends on who your customer is  You may change and pivot your customer  but when you do  you will need to re evaluate everything above in the pyramid   Problem  Maybe you have identified the right customer  but you are solving a problem that doesn t exist or doesn t matter that much  You can pivot here  but you ll need to re evaluate and change your solution  tech  and growth strategy  If you have the customer and problem right   you have a market   Solution  You ve identified the problems that matter to your customers  Now you have to build a product that resonates with your customers better than existing solutions in the market  Like any other changes in the pivot pyramid  changes you make in product must target quantifiable growth   Tech  Your technology is just a means to build your solution  Even if your product resonates well with your customers   your technology choices may be hindering your growth and retention  For instance  one of the main reasons Friendster failed as the first mainstream social network was because they couldn t keep their servers up with demand   Growth  All changes in the pivot pyramid must lead to growth  But some experiments do not require any significant change in your product or technology  These changes reside at the top of the pivot pyramid  A great marketer should frequently experiment with new growth tactics  This is needed because most growth channels get saturated or become too expensive over time   Famous Examples of Pivots for Each Stage  Key Takeaways from the Startup Pivot Pyramid  Frequency of Experiments  Changes you make at the bottom of the pyramid won t be frequent  For instance  you can t change who your customer is the problem you are solving often  The pace of experimentation increases at the top of the pyramid  This is especially the case as your startup matures and you find product market fit   Start with the customer and problem  A common mistake entrepreneurs make is that they start with their product and technology without truly understanding who their customer is  If this is broken   nothing else works  That s why you shouldn t focus too much on marketing before you nail the customer  problem and solution  First  you have make something people want  You don t want to put jet fuel in a car with a broken engine  Fix the engine first   Pivoting below  changes everything above  The changes you make at the bottom of the pivot pyramid  will impact your decisions above  But the changes you make at the top  don t necessarily require you to change things below   For example   if you pivot on your problem  you will need to change or re evaluate your product  technology and marketing channels  On the other hand  if you changed your technology stack  your customers may not notice any changes in your product  Similarly  experimenting with a new marketing channel may not require any changes in product or technology   You can t have multiple types of customers  A common mistake that kills early stage startups is focusing different types of customers at once  The changes you make at the bottom of the pivot pyramid will impact the decisions you make above like product  technology and marketing  So if you focus on more than one type of customer  you are literally building multiple startups at once  As you mature as a company and achieve product market fit   it is to have more than type of customer  e g  SMB and Enterprise   As an early stage startup  you can t afford to do that   Marketplaces  e g  Uber  Airbnb  are an exception to this  Marketplaces have two types of customers from day one  Sellers and Buyers  But that s why building marketplaces is really hard   All experiments must lead to GROWTH  One of the most important things founders can learn from growth marketers   is the scientific process for experimentation  That is also the foundation of the pivot pyramid  If you have an idea for a pivot like  testing a new marketing channel  or  implementing a referral program   GROWTH  or  migrating your servers to AWS   TECHNOLOGY   make sure it is closely tied to a measurable goal to help with growth  Have a thesis  run a low cost experiment  measure the results  and if it works   implement change   What is your Pyramid   So  what is your Pivot Pyramid  Tell us about your pivot stories and how they made an impact in your business In the mean time  be sure to follow

1208,training-dataset/business/284.txt,business,My Startup Generated Almost 2 Million Dollars  so I Shut it DownMy Startup Generated Almost 2 Million in Revenue  so I Shut It Down  It was 2010  6 years ago  I had that special moment while driving along the road in the city of Corona  in Southern California  just an hour east of Los Angeles  I concocted the idea  Then came the surges of butterflies  enthusiasm  passion  and excitement  The idea of something massive was planted inside of my mind  and I kept working on it  alone  with endless energy  The idea became larger and larger  It haunted me  I had to  create  to scratch the itch  I sat in stasis  perhaps considering the cost of a new endeavor  Feeding this little creature may turn into a monster  Curiosity gave way  and I groaned and moaned  finally birthing something  Then that something needed a name  So  I named it  What could possibly go wrong   Never name it until it is ready to get funding  Once you name it  you have to feed it and will never want to kill it    Sidebar  If you must name it  give it a name that can be killed  We will talk about being a  killer  later  but your thing needs to be killable  Project  W462  www projectW462 com  is a great name  it means absolutely nothing  Your heart will go on if it fails  Founders tend to want to share their  named  ideas  tell their family  friends  etc   who then want to say nice things and encourage you  which makes it harder to walk away    So this idea now had a name  I was working on it every night  so it took on a physical dimension  website  database  logo  URL  branding  code  etc   I spent way too much time on the dumbest little details  Don t judge  You ve done this too   The core of the platform was an innovation in the way people get things done in professional services  This market was 2 billion  which apparently is not large enough   The platform was not the first to market in this space  but neither was DropBox   there were around 10 other file sync backup services at the time of DropBox s release   The work I started doing was to create something to impress  solve  and make a dramatic entrance  This was not the right step  I missed something  What did I miss  I didn t listen to the data  What data  Oh right  I had none  I mean  I thought I had data  But looking back  it was more of a few hours of bookmarked articles and some downloaded data that I never really spent more than 30 minutes looking at  I think I studied my deductions on my tax return more than the business data  So in essence  I didn t generate or find enough data  and then  I didn t listen to it  I committed 2 cardinal sins  and then spent 6 years pivoting on the foundation of those mistakes   You can t pivot away structural mistakes   This is primary to the plight of the entrepreneur  You must align a solution with a problem that is experienced by legitimate customers  spending or willing to spend legitimate money  on a solution that works with empirical data  Bonus  find evidence of a customer culture that reinforces your story   We generated nearly 2 million dollars of revenue by the time it was all over  To the early stage startup founder  it may sound like we were on to something  but it was merely loose change from a leaky bucket  In our case  revenue was a vanity metric   Every day  somewhere in the world  a new batch of entrepreneurs is born  They will someday innovate on a particular market and feel passionately inspired to create something  Their gut is telling them things  That drives their excitement and the coffee and whiteboard sessions take over  The notion of change is lovely  It s wrapped into a whirlwind of new dreams and dopamine firing off in the brain  The reality  however  is more about science  data  and analysis  and much less about intuition and enthusiasm  The  feeling  and  intuition  I experienced along the path of launching  iterating  and pivoting  was leading me down the wrong path  I ignored certain data  insisting that my intuition made more sense to me  since I believed I was the target market  so therefore  my intuition is tantamount to data  Apparently I was wrong   Working Alone  I made the mistake of spending way too much time working alone  This is bad apparently  Won t do that again    Work alone  You re going to be best able to design revolutionary products and features if you work alone  Not on a committee  Not on a team      Steve Wozniak   Sorry Woz  but working alone for long periods of time may allow someone to get code banged out  or think clearly without interruption  but beyond that  it s not conducive to the long term success of the entrepreneur  Without Steve Jobs to reshape and sell the vision  Steve Wozniak would have remained a talented man working in obscurity  Sure  you need some long nights and even long weeks in obscurity  as the science of innovation would prescribe  But there s more to a  business  than just the product or service  You can make the thing  but then you have to sell the thing  or the thing will never be a real thing  As such  you who make things should work with those who sell things to make the thing a real thing  If you want to stick with making things and not working with others who sell things  you should have been a theoretical physicist  You could reinvent time  pontificate the stars  and create energy sources from rocks and dirt  For the rest of us  we must partner up and work together  Now I realize there s a healthy discussion around the  1 cause of startups crashing and burning is arguably founders disagreeing  conflicting on direction roles etc  or simply not working well together  This is unfortunate  but must be overcome  as the statistics against the solo entrepreneur are deafening  Paul Graham agrees  and has his well referenced  18 mistakes that kill startups  post about this  and  1 on his list is being a single founder  The core point he makes is that startups are so hard that as a founder  you need people  You need buddies  and the lowest moments don t seem so low  Walter Isaacson wrote in his book about Einstein  that even arguably the greatest thinker of all time  Even Albert Einstein  had his wife  another theoretical physicist   his good friend Marcel Grossman  and another buddy named Leo Szilard to double check all his ideas and work with him to take ideas to the next level  They were constantly grinding through the issues with him  And yet  so many founders shy away from that same grind  Friction of others in your little world is both necessary and healthy   After working alone for a bit  I was introduced to a brilliant designer  Jeff  who turned my sloppy first draft idea incarnate into an amazing UX  He jumped in as a co founder and we iterated on the idea  Our first rollout was to provide configurable services for anything digital that was possible  and a way for customers to further configure those services on their own  Below shows the first version   the first draft of the thing   The thing was raw  but still  a start  We tried playing around with clever branding  Time wasted there  But in the business model  there was some intrigue generated  We believed customers could be that people take the platform to a whole new place  so we believed it had teeth  The issue  however  with this first iteration  was that we had severely insufficient capitalization for fully implementing  supporting  and most importantly growing our customer base and gaining exposure  We also didn t have enough developers to help  and our time available was slim  working a normal day job and working on this in the evenings and weekends  A sad  sick love story of living for the dream ensued  I paid for things with my own  hard earned money  Not ideal  but now I view it as a tuition expense  Learning happens through trying  As an old Hebew saying goes  Asah Shamah  which means   by doing  we will understand   I had to  do  the work to understand how to win  I had to engage with the tools to learn the skill   I pitched the business  a lot  I went 6 months pitching  nothing  Once  at a Los Angeles Venture Capital conference  I touted a business plan in paper  embarrassed  but this is true   I walked the conference  pitching to literally any VC looking dude I could meet  As an introvert  this was like therapy of the worst kind  It was terrifying  A lowpoint was when I was literally  physically shoved aside by a young venture capital associate  I drove home dejected that day  But I got back up  I decided to pivot the business into a word  excel  and powerpoint focused tool for digital work outsourcing  We focused on a mobile app and simplified version of the original platform  A customer could simply drag and drop the word doc  excel spreadsheet  or powerpoint into the platform  then within a minute or 2  someone in the cloud takes a look   some secret sauce in there we believed   the customer gets a quote  approves the quote  and the work starts  Once it s done  we charge the card  and the customer iterates from there on another round of work and fees   I kept pitching with perseverance  and ignorance  and eventually landed a seed angel investor named Stan  and he invested  150 000 and then jumped in as another co founder to personally help  We hired interns  ordered pizza  and worked way too hard  Those guys were awesome   they early developer interns  We kept pushing  and thanks to Stan  we got into an accelerator  TechStars   who invested  113 000   and met some amazing folks there  We decided early in the accelerator process to pivot the business  our 2nd pivot   and spent 3 months building that out  Here s a shot of some of us at TechStars   Techstars photo  Shawn  Stan  and Matt   Pitching every day for months makes you battle hardened  The demo day event was tons of fun  and relieving to be done  but it produced zero dollars of investment  Here s our pitch photo shot   And for fun  the whole TechStars batch that year   We had a great time  But we got out of TechStars  not able to raise any funds  and I drove back to the house  We had to walk away from the office  advice  never sign personal guarantees on leases of underfunded seed stage startups   and had to work from home  This became the crucible of torture  and proved my dedication to solving the abominable problem we were after  This was a grueling process  Alone  at home  with no money  Serious problems   So I pivoted the business again  this time  by myself  I found a legitimate alternative way for this platform to shift and make money in the target market  and it generated  600 000 of revenue over the course of the next 10 months or so  this was crazy  Felt good  But still  not enough  The model was imperfect  broken  but I tried to make it work  Not a good idea  The math should work  without equivocation  But it was messy insistence of a messy existence   I took the best chart I had and cold emailed the local investors there in Los Angeles  who met with me and put in  200 000 to see if this thing had wings  I had shown them this amazing and true gross revenue traction chart that made me cry a few tears of joy at the time   the chart that i thought changed life itself  wrong   I pivoted the business again  trying to fix the areas that we knew were broken   Advice  don t try to fix when you need to kill  Fixing and killing aren t the same    Don t try to  fix  when you need to  kill    This money took us to another  500 000 in revenue  and yet the business had problems  So we pivoted again  from the ground up  raising another  200 000 from a few local investors and one from France  Crazy  This thing never dies  Perhaps it should have  I could have let it die so easily so many times  But I wasn t yet a killer  I was a fixer  I felt something was still there  I was wrong  It should have died  I won t get those years back  but it s ok  I learned so much  Analysis trumps intuition  Data destroys feeling   The next iteration was about instantly accessing freelance software developers through recorded video chats  text chats  phone calls  and mobile apps  The movement towards the enterprise customer was obvious  and their needs were different   So this worked decently well  We ended up generating close to 2 million dollars in total revenue  raising  650 000 in total seed funding across 4 funding events  But the business model and it s Aim is more important than perceivable progress  So many lessons learned  Many are below  impossible to communicate it all in one blog post   Feeling Founders Beware  Feeler Founder  an Entrepreneur that relies on their gut over their research  if they bothered to do any   Many entrepreneurs believe in their gut intuition  albeit  at their own demise  The personality types of those  gut  entrepreneurs probably rests under the  Feeler  types on the Myers Briggs  Below shows those types specifically   Feeler types in the middle of the myers briggs  I think I am an INFP  a classic intuition  feeling  perceiving type  Myers Briggs tells me that I am an  Idealist    Although  TechStars director labelled me as  a  Dreamer   in the worst way   lol  I still take that as a compliment   To quote the Myers Briggs profile for an INFP   As an INFP  your primary mode of living is focused internally  where you deal with things according to how you feel about them  or how they fit into your personal value system  Your secondary mode is external  where you take things in primarily via your intuition   This explains a lot  I digress  so anyway   Feelers   and especially anyone with an  NF  in the middle of their personality type  INFP  ENFP  or ENFJ   are more likely to go on their feelings and intuition  They believe something because in their minds  it makes perfect sense  and to deny the belief would mean denying or dismissing their own value  I know that ideas are special  but for them this gets too personal  This personalization of the startup business model is diametrically opposed to the ever proliferated lean startup model  which insists on a throw away approach to the business until you reach the first of the 3 levels  Problem Solution Fit  Throw away means short life spans of ideas  Some ideas rarely last the time it takes to blurt them out before they are invalidated  But the feeler founder and intuition driven founder resist the throwing away of anything  It takes a move of congress to reboot the business  Beware of the feeler founder  Hitler was a feeler  INFJ  so say the experts   So was Osama bin Laden  But Thomas Edison worked in an analytical way  being labelled as an ENTP  a  Thinker   It makes sense when he s testing out again and again over 1 000 types of filament for the light bulb  the very epitome of the lean startup model  pounding away at the problem solution fit until it gave way   Sunk Cost  The primary culprit for not calling it quits after TechStars was the idea of sunk cost  Jason Seats  managing director at our TechStars accelerator session graciously called me out on it but I was simply not ready to accept it  Ah yes  sunk cost   A sunk cost is an expense that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered   For newbies  here are 3 examples of sunk cost   A building was painted  costing  10 000  then the building burned down  The cost of painting it is gone forever  A non refundable airline ticket was purchased but the traveller missed the flight  That ticket value was lost and is not recoverable  Time was spent on a startup that ran out of money and wasn t able to raise more money or gain traction  That time is gone forever        Note  the only difference in this 3rd one is that the founders gained experience  knowledge  and hopefully performed many experiments within this problem domain  It truly has value that can be derived  but never as much as the founders would hope for  because it can t be liquidated and extracted  yet   This sunk cost thing was a huge deal for me  It was not going to let up  Again and again  I kept trying to make the last 12 months not be wasted  by investing another 12 months   then I had to keep going to make the last 24 months not be wasted  so another year   So let s not give up  let s pivot   I said  4 times  This is the lean startup model  yet  not exactly  The issue was that It took a year or more between pivots  and some of those pivots were for the wrong reason  I was trying to raise the heavy boat from the sea floor instead of calling it what it was  Sunk   Sidebar  Many people believe that 4 6 months of part time spare time is a great anecdotal time period to create and test your ideas into a workable test bed for potential customers to come in contact with and measure results  Of course this is anecdotal  and timelines will vary  but it sound right to me personally for most web   mobile products with little backend infrastructure required to test your theories  Killing your 4 months of work experiment is a lot easier than killing 40 months of work   Analysis vs  Intuition  But back to intuition  Abandoning intuition is not the goal  We need our gut  It s a great tool and must be leveraged  But not yet  First  your job is to put on the scientist outfit and goggles  Get all nerdy  Experimentation needs data and brainpower  not soul or spirit  It s science  not poetry  Doctors are infamously accursed as having this sort of  God Complex   where they feel like they can point out things based on their gut  rather than the data  or even revisiting the data   God complex of doctors  We are not doctors  but we suffer from the tech entrepreneur s edition of the God Complex  We know how to write code  We can program things into computers that look like this   complex code makes programmers feel like gods  This ability to code makes one feel powerful  I know  it s lame  Really lame   But in our defense  we literally are creating something from nothing  Danger  This superpower strokes an ego  It swells into pride  This then can be accredited as  talent  or  genius   and can become a real problem  How do you kill something that you  as a genius according to friends and family  have constructed  Answer  you don t  Genius is 99 9  a fallacy  More on that below   Hands On Analysis and Personalized Work  There are 2 key verbs I would point to as key to prevent the experience I went through  I don t claim any genius around this   The first one is  Hands On Analysis   you  personally  doing work  Work is hard  Forget about the overnight successes forever  Those are lies  Get your hands on the data  and slow your mind to a crawl   The second verb is  Personalized Work   hunkering down intensely  passion  on the problem  creating tests  manhandling them  extracting data  and then performing the next test without feeling anything more than a flutter of an eyebrow  The intuition of the inventor  err  experimenter  was replaced by simple personalizing the experimentation  Making it  yours   This allows one to feel good about their work  without fully owning it  If you own it  name it  feel it  believe it  think about it all the time  kiss it  hug it  etc  you will never be willing to drop kick it in the face and completely destroy it because it sucks  This unwillingness can be the core detriment to your company  That is  if your startup even becomes a company  It may get stuck in a love boat circling out in the bay   Case study  the wright brothers spent 2 years working on a kite before realizing that the data of their experiments was really worthless  They threw their data aside  along with the available published data at the time  and relied on their personal hand to tool tests and explorative work to lead them  Their experimentation led to realize that all of the available data was actually wrong in the area of wing size and lift  There was a certain number called the Smeaton Coefficient  which determined the wing size ratio  This number was the great realization  It was in the data  in the experimentation  and in the personal analysis  hands on work that brought the wright brothers to a point where they could purchase materials and cut the cloth to lay out on the wings   Smeaton Coefficient   reinvented by the wright brothers  Armed with this hand drawn data  and supported by their own experiment results  they found renewed energy for the task  several years invested at this point   and started building the right type of wings  The rest of the story is well known  But it took 2 more years of experimentation using that data to get to the Wright Flyer in 1903  This was not an overnight play  This was  Personalized Work   It meant something to them  but it wasn t a result of intuition  It was methodical and scientific work   Confirmation Bias  I felt that our platform had truly differentiated itself  I validated a business model  even several backup business models  None of which were sufficiently modeled out in excel formulas  and none of which were submitted into sufficient analysis processes to dissect them objectively  Apparently we had not differentiated ourselves sufficiently  and our business models were not including the true size of the market and the cost of customer acquisition  I had a condition called  Confirmation Bias   It s a term I heard in episode 299 of a podcast called  Startups for the Rest of Us   At the 21 25 mark  they talk about entrepreneurial blindspots  one of which is   being able to maintain your objectivity   Entrepreneurs commonly fall in love with their own ideas  and bend their research  leaning one direction  This causes them to preemptively  confirm  a business model as being valid  prior to due process  This is easy to understand  as most people in general will easily embrace their own ideas  It s so dangerous because the innovator will do the work but then pollute the results with their love for a specific end result they have in mind  This pollution reveals itself with the red flag of a defensive mindset  which deters feedback and insists on certain assertions that are not as clear to others  This can totally ruin you  You spend way too much time on your incorrect assumption about a market or problem domain because you believe something and won t stop until the universe alters to reflect the view you have in mind  This won t happen  You will fail  Objectivity must be maintained  Nokia  the cell phone company as most of us know it  all started as a paper mill in 1865  They maintained an objective mindset over hundreds of years and incorporated that into their culture  They solid rubber boots  rubber tires  paper  and then later  electronic telecommunications equipment  and then finally  cell phones  Their ability to pivot and expand and change were based on an unmatched level of objectivity  Furthering this point  the control over what works and doesn t work is not in the hands of the startup founder  When you invent something  or build on the inventions of others  you are not in control of how it may develop and change in the hands of users  SMS text messaging was originally intended for hearing impaired users  around 1  approximately of the total user group  The utility of texting however  exploded to 100  of the market instead of just 1   Now everyone of every age uses text messaging  and it s a part of our very culture as internet   phone connected humans  Remaining objective and pulling back to watch what happens is to your own credit and to your own personal benefit  It could take that  amazing  idea or concoction you came up with and turn it into something exponentially larger   Iterate  Iterate  Iterate  Kill  Iterate  Iterate  Iterate  Kill   The iteration  however  should be short thought and experiment cycles  Not year long development cycles  The faster your can explore  experiment  test  change  and iterate  the more likely you are to get a hit  Once you have iterated sufficiently   which can be 10 times or 100 times or 500 times   you need to give yourself permission to just kill the thing  There s nothing wrong with stepping back from all of the attempts and experimentation and conclude  that dog won t hunt   It s ok  Move on  Spend a few minutes accepting the time spent  and rejoice in the wisdom of the ancients in the fact that you re about to kill the thing  and this may in fact lead to the greatest next thing you ve ever touched  The killing is worth it  You will grow wiser and stronger each time   Shoulders of Giants  It s so relieving to accept this  there is no such thing as creativity  and no supreme genius master mind  Creativity  if it exists  is certainly not a result of caffeine or post workout euphoria  It s not the firing of dopamine within your brain after you conjure together a possible business idea or innovation  It is  if anything  just sustained work in one direction  with velocity and  optionally  some inspiration involved  It s flavor is science  To find solutions to problems  the start and end of your creative process would be littered with data  Your pockets would be full of experiments  results  statistics  graphs  case studies  charts  working models  government studies  competitor research  and anecdotes galore  In the wonderful book   How to Fly a Horse   by Kevin Ashton  the concept of creativity is debunked  and the idea of someone being a  genius  is holistically obliterated  He calls the genius  common    Not denying the existence of truly high intelligent born individuals like Einstein  but even Einstein worked intensely for a lifetime on his theories and iterated on them   Ashton is brilliant in systematically deconstructing all known  geniuses  and turning them into simple case studies of time lapse photos  Layer upon layer  they are exposed as normal people  not geniuses  They built on the work of others who went before them  Every startup is compiled and launched because of layers of work and effort from those who have gone before  Ashton writes   Every creator inherits concepts  context  tools  methods  data  laws  principles  and models from thousands of other people  dead and alive  No creator deserves too much credit  because every creator is in so much debt    Isaac Newton coined this concept in 1676    If I have seen further  it is by standing on the shoulders of giants     Isaac Newton  Ironically  this comment itself was copied from George Herbert in 1651     and Herbert yanked it from Robert Burton in 1621      and Burton stole it from a Spanish Theologian  Diego de Estella     and de Estella ripped it from John of Salisbury in 1159     and Salisbury stole it from Bernard of Shaft in 1130   Who knows where Bernard of Shaft got it from  But certainly Newton didn t create it  it wasn t him  being creative   nor was it him being a genius  He was simply recalling something he had read  His ability to retain and express the words of others is equivalent to genius apparently  He is called a genius because by the age of 26 he figured out gravity  elliptical orbits  coined the 3 laws of motion  and mapped out the color spectrum  Certainly he was gifted with remarkable intelligence  Maybe he was a genius  But in that moment  he was just remembering something he read  In that moment  he wasn t a genius  Certainly Orville and Wilber Wright were not geniuses  nor exceptionally creative  They were just relentless experimenters and found pay dirt after years of iterations on a particular thing  bouncing their thoughts off of each other  again and again  day after day  year after year  Their intuition came in various spurts  but was never the cause of the success  It just led them to their next experimental tweak  It s true that many programmers are also great musicians  writing songs   creating  music  etc  but even then  the song writing process is iterative and requires work  Their inspiration led them to consider doing the work  and then they applied effort to it to perform the work  One song may require 50 iterations  This is not genius either   It s worthy of unpacking this further  The inventor of the X Ray was truly credited with changing modern medicine in 1895  and impacting the entire world  seemingly overnight  But the real story is a little more interesting than a genius in his workshop  241 years earlier  in 1654  a man named Otto von Guericke invented the vacuum pump  Robert Boyle  1627 1691  build on that vacuum pump discovery  and furthered it with his Boyle s Law  which was to discover an inverse relationship between the pressure and the volume of a gas  Heinrich Geissler had built upon Boyles lifetime of work  and invented the vacuum tube  which later became the basis of televisions and computers  English physicist William Crookes built on Geissler s work in 1869 and came up with the Crookes tube  where electrons were discovered  Then 1895  a Wilhelm Conrad R ntgen a German physicist built on the work of William Crookes  and spent 6 weeks straight  eating and sleeping in his lab before inventing X rays  So in essence  X Rays took 241 years to develop  Was Wilhelm Conrad R ntgen an overnight success  Nope  But he gets the credit  He learned well  He built on the layers from others  and he furthered the progress of many  It was progressive  One thing led to another   Still on this topic of creativity and genius  just because it is so paramount   My favorite author  Malcom Gladwell  in his recent podcast   Revisionist History   from July 28  2016  asking how genius emerges  The first 13 minutes of the episode talk about the song   Deportee   written by Elvis Costello  The song was originally produced by others  and guided to a place that Costello was not satisfied with  In fact  it was loathed by his fans and he himself  But over time  after iterating on it alone  Costello brought  Deportee  to a much better rendition years later  whereas the producer of the original bad version finally got a chance to hear the new and recreated version  stating to the host of the show   He seemed to have  found  the song   Right there  That was the moment  He  found  the song  The song was there  but due to producers influencing him  pushing him left and right  and driving a commercial mass appeal experience  they missed the artistry within the artist  That may or may not always translate to the entrepreneur who feels like an artist  but certainly it s a helpful anecdote  Gladwell makes the best summation  stating   It was genius  but just wasn t genius yet   Perhaps many songs  and startups  should have been incubated further before hitting the ears and web browsers of a picky planet Earth  They are working and world changing innovations and changes  but they just don t exist yet  The artist needs his forest  ocean  or desert  He needs time  His sound requires iteration  It may take years  Decades  Lifetimes  The entrepreneur who  feels  things can go to their happy place for rest and inspiration  but when it comes to getting back to work  they have to put on their scientist goggles  their big boy pants  and assume the position of a relentless experimentation junky  Artist becomes scientist  and a song is found after experiment  1038  or  472 or  192   It s not that I am so smart  it s just that I stay with problems longer    Albert Einstein  Goal  experimentation on a single problem in rapid succession   In the podcast  Gladwell portrays the artist in motion  in progress  on a continuum  where he s  on to something   but has yet to arrive  This wet concrete is primary and necessary  Going back to Kevin Ashton s book  he points to the iterative development of many works we cite as being revolutionary or genius  Leonardo da Vinci took literally 12 years to paint just the lips on the Mona Lisa  He iterated  brush stroke over brush stroke  Layer upon layer  Then he was called a genius   Pokemon Go  creator  Mark Hanke  was called an overnight success  but then the world learned it was a 20 year collection of experiences and progress and partnering and positioning  Good fortune came for Mark as well  when Nintendo also had decided to strategically partner with Google  and they funded the Pokemon Go concept with 30 million dollars  So there s that  But Mark was there  in position  learning  iterating  and his work brought ample reward  A Biblical proverb states   All hard work leads to profit  but talk leads only to poverty   Talk  a lack of experimentation  Rephrased   All experimentation leads to profit    Enthusiastic Skepticism  So how does a budding entrepreneur take on his fellow co founders with the mentality of experimentation and  throw away   when they may be digging in their heels  focused on it for the long haul  entrenching themselves for better or worse on a singular vision  My advice  if its worth anything  is to pick co founders well  and also  to share with them this great TED podcast episode on failure and killing your own projects  It goes through the details of how Google X works and how they literally aim to kill their own projects  Google X is a  moonshot factory  that prides itself in failing as fast as humanly possible  They created GoogleGlass and are working aggressively on self driving cars and balloons that bring the internet to Africa  Engineering teams are rewarded with cash bonuses and extra vacations for exposing the cold  hard  evidential proof that the project will fail  They literally are trying hard to kill their own projects  and they get standing ovations and high fives for it amongst their peers  Why  Not because they love burning cash  There are 2 core reasons   Financial cost  It saves Google X tons of money  avoiding years of development on ideas that are bound to fail  Opportunity cost  It allows those teams to work on other projects that   if not killed   could grow into massively impactful ventures   The managing director is the primary project killing master mind  stating   Enthusiastic skepticism is not the enemy of boundless optimism  It s optimism s perfect partner  It unlocks the potential in every idea    Are they feeling the pain of failure  No  Are they shifting perspective and creating a culture of experimentation and curiosity  Yes  And dopamine is firing off in their brains  yanking them out of bed every morning with hunger for more  Sure  they have hundreds of millions of dollars to play with  You probably don t  And they have all the time in the world  You are probably working on the dream only nights and weekends  fighting traffic every day to your normal job like the rest of us  But still  the approach is pure wisdom   The bad news  experimentation and failure are absolutely necessary   The good news  it s never been easier  cheaper  or faster  to achieve that failure   Each experiment  each attempt  each day spent trying  they add up  It s not a zero sum game  You learn more and more each time you kill your work  Kill  Kill  Kill  This is how to Win Win Win  Killing however  is not enough  You have to kill those inadequate or inept or leaky projects FAST  Killing projects slowly is torture  Killing projects fast is intelligent  The faster you kill 216 iterations  the faster you get to the  217  which becomes a winning combination  Fail Fast  yes  I am not sure who originally came up with this  but it was well framed in the  Fail Fast  mantra of TechStars and many other accelerators   I have not failed  I ve just found 10 000 ways that won t work    Thomas Edison  Entrepreneurs become effective when they deliberately un tether themselves completely from their original hypothesis  They don t insist on  ideas  taking the same shape and form for which they may have originally imagined them  They are open minded  knowing that one thing will lead to another  and they will pound away at this market  this general problem domain  or tangential ones  until their data leads them to a solid understanding of all possible solutions  and one of those solutions may have some untapped opportunity   Work the Equation  Software is eating the world  and startup tech wanderers are filling up every empty space in every market  The incubators and accelerators have hatched every conceivable concoction  creating a surplus of providers for any new service  As soon as the product market fit is achieved   lean startup   it turns into a rat race of competitors to lock in that expansive and fresh new customer base   First to market      Early adopters    these are the voyages of the starship  delusional   as those factors are simply not enough to solve the equation  More math is needed  Arm yourself with an indisputable level of ammunition  advantage  data  tests  and an all star team to exploit the opportunity to its inevitable endpoint  You have to be willing to kill your own ideas perpetually  and abandon any and all passion that you originally felt  Disown your  feeler  self   if that is your personality type   and adopt a methodical  analytical mentality  You must get off the long game train  and get on the start and stop  hop on hop off municipal bus  where you can change your mind  change the plan  change the target  change  change  change  all day  every day  until you extract the demon  This is not easy  But it s the path of progress  I implore you to not embrace the infamous  triumph of hope over experience   and get your arms around a 95  scientific approach to your entrepreneurial efforts   Synopsis of my opinions  after 6 years  4 pivots  650k seed money in 4 seed funding events  2 cars  moving 4 times  generating almost 2 million dollars of revenue  and writing around 1 4 million lines of code   Know your personality type first  by taking the myers briggs test  Know your strengths by taking the strengthsfinders 2 0 test  Give up  most of  your hobbies  The tech preneur lifestyle is a time sucker  Create a master list of interest areas you have  keep editing it on a regular basis  The areas you find fascinating are where your energy sources exist  You will want to engage in and out of topics and research to remain fresh mentally  whether its your ideas or others   most of your time should stay in the areas you actually care about  Problems that you feel should be solved  This helps keep your mental energy in tune  Surround yourself with talented tech co founders and entrepreneurs that you really like  as real world friends  Become immersed with those friends and find the time to develop those relationships intentionally and openly  Bounce ideas  work on things  help each other move  buddy up at all potential moments  If someone within your party of talented friends presents ideas  work on them as if they were your own  Think about them  process them  do research  spend hours and hours on the interactive banter back and forth till the ideas are well developed and actual experiments can be performed  Create an experiment matrix in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets  showcasing the various theoretical possibilities  multiple hypotheses  market data  customer data  and open ended outcomes  This matrix services the organizational structure of any work performed  and communicates the backbone of the story  Eventually this can help form the narrative of the company  and would properly address the inquisitions of your seed investor pool  This is a mind map of every possible connotation of the problem domain and should be continuously updated  Formulate a mindset of throw away work like GoogleX does  Reward each other as if proving why a particular idea or innovation would not work is a goal or sport  This is where a powerful culture can be formed  between the co founders informally  on a couch at your apartment  Not later in the HR department  Right there on the couch over a pizza  Become a great researcher  Your research and investigative talents are more valuable than your programming skills  You will find answers in research that shave off months  if not years  of wasted time in experiments  Become a great experimenter  Your experiments will shave off months or years of time wasted on actual programming code  Team up with the right founders who can cover the following categories  in the order of importance   leadership  sales  branding  fun  design  technical architecture  and finally  software code  Embrace a methodical lifestyle  Set a Google calendar event for working on experiment  293 on Wednesday between 6 and 7 45 pm  Then go work out  Spend appropriate time on yourself and maintain your mental health  Get into a rhythm that generates healthy habits  If you are working a full time job and doing the startup thing in the nights and weekends  be sure to schedule it carefully and spend more time with the cofounder buddies than working on the solution  because interaction and time spent in those relationships and dialogue then them will likely produce much more fruit and much more momentum than a late night coding your brains out on one particular iteration of one particular experiment  Sleep  Water  Patience  Enjoy life  Audiobooks are great  but don t overdo it  Allow the brain to rest  Failure is a great option  Failing today may lead you to succeeding tomorrow  Quite literally sometimes  giving up on an idea based on the true data received out of an experiment is the most impressive work you can ever perform  Learn to frame your conversations around the efforts around a problem domain instead of the results  Telling your friends and family all about your big idea is the worst possible thing you can do to yourself  They don t need to know  They already like you  It s completely acceptable to be in research mode for a season  There s nobody you need to impress  Be very selective in what general problem domains you start experimentation with  Some level of interest and intrigue should be there  You don t always fall in love with your startup but you should at least be interested in the problem domain or market  Better to focus on the problem than focus on the solution  as the solution may be killed 259 times before it evolves into a more final and palatable solution  Most importantly  give your intuition a nice little compartment in your mind  Don t let your gut drive your work   That s it from me  I am off to work on killing my latest experiment   Whistle539,"[1208 626 611 710 746 937 1258

1258,training-dataset/business/1323.txt,business,Do Things that Don t Scale        Want to start a startup  Get funded by Y Combinator   July 2013    One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is to do things that don t scale  A lot of would be founders believe that startups either take off or don t  You build something  make it available  and if you ve made a better mousetrap  people beat a path to your door as promised  Or they don t  in which case the market must not exist    1      Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off  There may be a handful that just grew by themselves  but usually it takes some sort of push to get them going  A good metaphor would be the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters  Once the engine was going  it would keep going  but there was a separate and laborious process to get it going     Recruit    The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually  Nearly all startups have to  You can t wait for users to come to you  You have to go out and get them     Stripe is one of the most successful startups we ve funded  and the problem they solved was an urgent one  If anyone could have sat back and waited for users  it was Stripe  But in fact they re famous within YC for aggressive early user acquisition     Startups building things for other startups have a big pool of potential users in the other companies we ve funded  and none took better advantage of it than Stripe  At YC we use the term  Collison installation  for the technique they invented  More diffident founders ask  Will you try our beta   and if the answer is yes  they say  Great  we ll send you a link   But the Collison brothers weren t going to wait  When anyone agreed to try Stripe they d say  Right then  give me your laptop  and set them up on the spot     There are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users individually  One is a combination of shyness and laziness  They d rather sit at home writing code than go out and talk to a bunch of strangers and probably be rejected by most of them  But for a startup to succeed  at least one founder  usually the CEO  will have to spend a lot of time on sales and marketing    2      The other reason founders ignore this path is that the absolute numbers seem so small at first  This can t be how the big  famous startups got started  they think  The mistake they make is to underestimate the power of compound growth  We encourage every startup to measure their progress by weekly growth rate  If you have 100 users  you need to get 10 more next week to grow 10  a week  And while 110 may not seem much better than 100  if you keep growing at 10  a week you ll be surprised how big the numbers get  After a year you ll have 14 000 users  and after 2 years you ll have 2 million     You ll be doing different things when you re acquiring users a thousand at a time  and growth has to slow down eventually  But if the market exists you can usually start by recruiting users manually and then gradually switch to less manual methods    3      Airbnb is a classic example of this technique  Marketplaces are so hard to get rolling that you should expect to take heroic measures at first  In Airbnb s case  these consisted of going door to door in New York  recruiting new users and helping existing ones improve their listings  When I remember the Airbnbs during YC  I picture them with rolly bags  because when they showed up for tuesday dinners they d always just flown back from somewhere     Fragile    Airbnb now seems like an unstoppable juggernaut  but early on it was so fragile that about 30 days of going out and engaging in person with users made the difference between success and failure     That initial fragility was not a unique feature of Airbnb  Almost all startups are fragile initially  And that s one of the biggest things inexperienced founders and investors  and reporters and know it alls on forums  get wrong about them  They unconsciously judge larval startups by the standards of established ones  They re like someone looking at a newborn baby and concluding  there s no way this tiny creature could ever accomplish anything      It s harmless if reporters and know it alls dismiss your startup  They always get things wrong  It s even ok if investors dismiss your startup  they ll change their minds when they see growth  The big danger is that you ll dismiss your startup yourself  I ve seen it happen  I often have to encourage founders who don t see the full potential of what they re building  Even Bill Gates made that mistake  He returned to Harvard for the fall semester after starting Microsoft  He didn t stay long  but he wouldn t have returned at all if he d realized Microsoft was going to be even a fraction of the size it turned out to be    4      The question to ask about an early stage startup is not  is this company taking over the world   but  how big could this company get if the founders did the right things   And the right things often seem both laborious and inconsequential at the time  Microsoft can t have seemed very impressive when it was just a couple guys in Albuquerque writing Basic interpreters for a market of a few thousand hobbyists  as they were then called   but in retrospect that was the optimal path to dominating microcomputer software  And I know Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia didn t feel like they were en route to the big time as they were taking  professional  photos of their first hosts  apartments  They were just trying to survive  But in retrospect that too was the optimal path to dominating a big market     How do you find users to recruit manually  If you build something to solve your own problems  then you only have to find your peers  which is usually straightforward  Otherwise you ll have to make a more deliberate effort to locate the most promising vein of users  The usual way to do that is to get some initial set of users by doing a comparatively untargeted launch  and then to observe which kind seem most enthusiastic  and seek out more like them  For example  Ben Silbermann noticed that a lot of the earliest Pinterest users were interested in design  so he went to a conference of design bloggers to recruit users  and that worked well    5      Delight    You should take extraordinary measures not just to acquire users  but also to make them happy  For as long as they could  which turned out to be surprisingly long   Wufoo sent each new user a hand written thank you note  Your first users should feel that signing up with you was one of the best choices they ever made  And you in turn should be racking your brains to think of new ways to delight them     Why do we have to teach startups this  Why is it counterintuitive for founders  Three reasons  I think     One is that a lot of startup founders are trained as engineers  and customer service is not part of the training of engineers  You re supposed to build things that are robust and elegant  not be slavishly attentive to individual users like some kind of salesperson  Ironically  part of the reason engineering is traditionally averse to handholding is that its traditions date from a time when engineers were less powerful when they were only in charge of their narrow domain of building things  rather than running the whole show  You can be ornery when you re Scotty  but not when you re Kirk     Another reason founders don t focus enough on individual customers is that they worry it won t scale  But when founders of larval startups worry about this  I point out that in their current state they have nothing to lose  Maybe if they go out of their way to make existing users super happy  they ll one day have too many to do so much for  That would be a great problem to have  See if you can make it happen  And incidentally  when it does  you ll find that delighting customers scales better than you expected  Partly because you can usually find ways to make anything scale more than you would have predicted  and partly because delighting customers will by then have permeated your culture     I have never once seen a startup lured down a blind alley by trying too hard to make their initial users happy     But perhaps the biggest thing preventing founders from realizing how attentive they could be to their users is that they ve never experienced such attention themselves  Their standards for customer service have been set by the companies they ve been customers of  which are mostly big ones  Tim Cook doesn t send you a hand written note after you buy a laptop  He can t  But you can  That s one advantage of being small  you can provide a level of service no big company can    6      Once you realize that existing conventions are not the upper bound on user experience  it s interesting in a very pleasant way to think about how far you could go to delight your users     Experience    I was trying to think of a phrase to convey how extreme your attention to users should be  and I realized Steve Jobs had already done it  insanely great  Steve wasn t just using  insanely  as a synonym for  very   He meant it more literally that one should focus on quality of execution to a degree that in everyday life would be considered pathological     All the most successful startups we ve funded have  and that probably doesn t surprise would be founders  What novice founders don t get is what insanely great translates to in a larval startup  When Steve Jobs started using that phrase  Apple was already an established company  He meant the Mac  and its documentation and even packaging such is the nature of obsession  should be insanely well designed and manufactured  That s not hard for engineers to grasp  It s just a more extreme version of designing a robust and elegant product     What founders have a hard time grasping  and Steve himself might have had a hard time grasping  is what insanely great morphs into as you roll the time slider back to the first couple months of a startup s life  It s not the product that should be insanely great  but the experience of being your user  The product is just one component of that  For a big company it s necessarily the dominant one  But you can and should give users an insanely great experience with an early  incomplete  buggy product  if you make up the difference with attentiveness     Can  perhaps  but should  Yes  Over engaging with early users is not just a permissible technique for getting growth rolling  For most successful startups it s a necessary part of the feedback loop that makes the product good  Making a better mousetrap is not an atomic operation  Even if you start the way most successful startups have  by building something you yourself need  the first thing you build is never quite right  And except in domains with big penalties for making mistakes  it s often better not to aim for perfection initially  In software  especially  it usually works best to get something in front of users as soon as it has a quantum of utility  and then see what they do with it  Perfectionism is often an excuse for procrastination  and in any case your initial model of users is always inaccurate  even if you re one of them    7      The feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest users will be the best you ever get  When you re so big you have to resort to focus groups  you ll wish you could go over to your users  homes and offices and watch them use your stuff like you did when there were only a handful of them     Fire    Sometimes the right unscalable trick is to focus on a deliberately narrow market  It s like keeping a fire contained at first to get it really hot before adding more logs     That s what Facebook did  At first it was just for Harvard students  In that form it only had a potential market of a few thousand people  but because they felt it was really for them  a critical mass of them signed up  After Facebook stopped being for Harvard students  it remained for students at specific colleges for quite a while  When I interviewed Mark Zuckerberg at Startup School  he said that while it was a lot of work creating course lists for each school  doing that made students feel the site was their natural home     Any startup that could be described as a marketplace usually has to start in a subset of the market  but this can work for other startups as well  It s always worth asking if there s a subset of the market in which you can get a critical mass of users quickly    8      Most startups that use the contained fire strategy do it unconsciously  They build something for themselves and their friends  who happen to be the early adopters  and only realize later that they could offer it to a broader market  The strategy works just as well if you do it unconsciously  The biggest danger of not being consciously aware of this pattern is for those who naively discard part of it  E g  if you don t build something for yourself and your friends  or even if you do  but you come from the corporate world and your friends are not early adopters  you ll no longer have a perfect initial market handed to you on a platter     Among companies  the best early adopters are usually other startups  They re more open to new things both by nature and because  having just been started  they haven t made all their choices yet  Plus when they succeed they grow fast  and you with them  It was one of many unforeseen advantages of the YC model  and specifically of making YC big  that B2B startups now have an instant market of hundreds of other startups ready at hand     Meraki    For hardware startups there s a variant of doing things that don t scale that we call  pulling a Meraki   Although we didn t fund Meraki  the founders were Robert Morris s grad students  so we know their history  They got started by doing something that really doesn t scale  assembling their routers themselves     Hardware startups face an obstacle that software startups don t  The minimum order for a factory production run is usually several hundred thousand dollars  Which can put you in a catch 22  without a product you can t generate the growth you need to raise the money to manufacture your product  Back when hardware startups had to rely on investors for money  you had to be pretty convincing to overcome this  The arrival of crowdfunding  or more precisely  preorders  has helped a lot  But even so I d advise startups to pull a Meraki initially if they can  That s what Pebble did  The Pebbles assembled the first several hundred watches themselves  If they hadn t gone through that phase  they probably wouldn t have sold  10 million worth of watches when they did go on Kickstarter     Like paying excessive attention to early customers  fabricating things yourself turns out to be valuable for hardware startups  You can tweak the design faster when you re the factory  and you learn things you d never have known otherwise  Eric Migicovsky of Pebble said one of things he learned was  how valuable it was to source good screws   Who knew     Consult    Sometimes we advise founders of B2B startups to take over engagement to an extreme  and to pick a single user and act as if they were consultants building something just for that one user  The initial user serves as the form for your mold  keep tweaking till you fit their needs perfectly  and you ll usually find you ve made something other users want too  Even if there aren t many of them  there are probably adjacent territories that have more  As long as you can find just one user who really needs something and can act on that need  you ve got a toehold in making something people want  and that s as much as any startup needs initially    9      Consulting is the canonical example of work that doesn t scale  But  like other ways of bestowing one s favors liberally  it s safe to do it so long as you re not being paid to  That s where companies cross the line  So long as you re a product company that s merely being extra attentive to a customer  they re very grateful even if you don t solve all their problems  But when they start paying you specifically for that attentiveness when they start paying you by the hour they expect you to do everything     Another consulting like technique for recruiting initially lukewarm users is to use your software yourselves on their behalf  We did that at Viaweb  When we approached merchants asking if they wanted to use our software to make online stores  some said no  but they d let us make one for them  Since we would do anything to get users  we did  We felt pretty lame at the time  Instead of organizing big strategic e commerce partnerships  we were trying to sell luggage and pens and men s shirts  But in retrospect it was exactly the right thing to do  because it taught us how it would feel to merchants to use our software  Sometimes the feedback loop was near instantaneous  in the middle of building some merchant s site I d find I needed a feature we didn t have  so I d spend a couple hours implementing it and then resume building the site     Manual    There s a more extreme variant where you don t just use your software  but are your software  When you only have a small number of users  you can sometimes get away with doing by hand things that you plan to automate later  This lets you launch faster  and when you do finally automate yourself out of the loop  you ll know exactly what to build because you ll have muscle memory from doing it yourself     When manual components look to the user like software  this technique starts to have aspects of a practical joke  For example  the way Stripe delivered  instant  merchant accounts to its first users was that the founders manually signed them up for traditional merchant accounts behind the scenes     Some startups could be entirely manual at first  If you can find someone with a problem that needs solving and you can solve it manually  go ahead and do that for as long as you can  and then gradually automate the bottlenecks  It would be a little frightening to be solving users  problems in a way that wasn t yet automatic  but less frightening than the far more common case of having something automatic that doesn t yet solve anyone s problems     Big    I should mention one sort of initial tactic that usually doesn t work  the Big Launch  I occasionally meet founders who seem to believe startups are projectiles rather than powered aircraft  and that they ll make it big if and only if they re launched with sufficient initial velocity  They want to launch simultaneously in 8 different publications  with embargoes  And on a tuesday  of course  since they read somewhere that s the optimum day to launch something     It s easy to see how little launches matter  Think of some successful startups  How many of their launches do you remember  All you need from a launch is some initial core of users  How well you re doing a few months later will depend more on how happy you made those users than how many there were of them    10      So why do founders think launches matter  A combination of solipsism and laziness  They think what they re building is so great that everyone who hears about it will immediately sign up  Plus it would be so much less work if you could get users merely by broadcasting your existence  rather than recruiting them one at a time  But even if what you re building really is great  getting users will always be a gradual process partly because great things are usually also novel  but mainly because users have other things to think about     Partnerships too usually don t work  They don t work for startups in general  but they especially don t work as a way to get growth started  It s a common mistake among inexperienced founders to believe that a partnership with a big company will be their big break  Six months later they re all saying the same thing  that was way more work than we expected  and we ended up getting practically nothing out of it    11      It s not enough just to do something extraordinary initially  You have to make an extraordinary effort initially  Any strategy that omits the effort whether it s expecting a big launch to get you users  or a big partner is ipso facto suspect     Vector    The need to do something unscalably laborious to get started is so nearly universal that it might be a good idea to stop thinking of startup ideas as scalars  Instead we should try thinking of them as pairs of what you re going to build  plus the unscalable thing s  you re going to do initially to get the company going     It could be interesting to start viewing startup ideas this way  because now that there are two components you can try to be imaginative about the second as well as the first  But in most cases the second component will be what it usually is recruit users manually and give them an overwhelmingly good experience and the main benefit of treating startups as vectors will be to remind founders they need to work hard in two dimensions    12      In the best case  both components of the vector contribute to your company s DNA  the unscalable things you have to do to get started are not merely a necessary evil  but change the company permanently for the better  If you have to be aggressive about user acquisition when you re small  you ll probably still be aggressive when you re big  If you have to manufacture your own hardware  or use your software on users s behalf  you ll learn things you couldn t have learned otherwise  And most importantly  if you have to work hard to delight users when you only have a handful of them  you ll keep doing it when you have a lot                 Notes      1   Actually Emerson never mentioned mousetraps specifically  He wrote  If a man has good corn or wood  or boards  or pigs  to sell  or can make better chairs or knives  crucibles or church organs  than anybody else  you will find a broad hard beaten road to his house  though it be in the woods        2   Thanks to Sam Altman for suggesting I make this explicit  And no  you can t avoid doing sales by hiring someone to do it for you  You have to do sales yourself initially  Later you can hire a real salesperson to replace you       3   The reason this works is that as you get bigger  your size helps you grow  Patrick Collison wrote  At some point  there was a very noticeable change in how Stripe felt  It tipped from being this boulder we had to push to being a train car that in fact had its own momentum        4   One of the more subtle ways in which YC can help founders is by calibrating their ambitions  because we know exactly how a lot of successful startups looked when they were just getting started       5   If you re building something for which you can t easily get a small set of users to observe e g  enterprise software and in a domain where you have no connections  you ll have to rely on cold calls and introductions  But should you even be working on such an idea       6   Garry Tan pointed out an interesting trap founders fall into in the beginning  They want so much to seem big that they imitate even the flaws of big companies  like indifference to individual users  This seems to them more  professional   Actually it s better to embrace the fact that you re small and use whatever advantages that brings       7   Your user model almost couldn t be perfectly accurate  because users  needs often change in response to what you build for them  Build them a microcomputer  and suddenly they need to run spreadsheets on it  because the arrival of your new microcomputer causes someone to invent the spreadsheet       8   If you have to choose between the subset that will sign up quickest and those that will pay the most  it s usually best to pick the former  because those are probably the early adopters  They ll have a better influence on your product  and they won t make you expend as much effort on sales  And though they have less money  you don t need that much to maintain your target growth rate early on       9   Yes  I can imagine cases where you could end up making something that was really only useful for one user  But those are usually obvious  even to inexperienced founders  So if it s not obvious you d be making something for a market of one  don t worry about that danger       10   There may even be an inverse correlation between launch magnitude and success  The only launches I remember are famous flops like the Segway and Google Wave  Wave is a particularly alarming example  because I think it was actually a great idea that was killed partly by its overdone launch       11   Google grew big on the back of Yahoo  but that wasn t a partnership  Yahoo was their customer       12   It will also remind founders that an idea where the second component is empty an idea where there is nothing you can do to get going  e g  because you have no way to find users to recruit manually is probably a bad idea  at least for those founders     Thanks to Sam Altman  Paul Buchheit  Patrick Collison  Kevin Hale  Steven Levy  Jessica Livingston  Geoff Ralston  and

1325,training-dataset/business/486.txt,business,Why Acceptance of Failure is Critical to Startup SuccessWhy Acceptance of Failure is Critical to Startup Success  I talk about failure a lot because I think it can be tremendously instructive and I think that success without failure often masks underlying lessons   I even prefer to fund entrepreneurs who have experience some level of set backs in their careers or startups because I think it brings a humility to decision making that I find healthy  I have experienced many first time entrepreneurs with too much hubris if fund raising came easily and press was fawning and employees joined in droves and customer adoption has been rapid   When I hear the realism that comes from founders with setback it elicits an understanding of what it takes to be successful at a startup that frankly can t exist unless you ve walked in those shoes before  It is these stories that helps me bond more with the team because I ve personally experienced just about every kind of setback at my first startup   Raising too much capital  too quickly   at too high of valuations  Hiring too quickly and too senior  Building too much functionality before market validation  Charging too much  keeping prices too high  Seeking too much press before we were ready for it  Being too driven by quarterly revenue targets that led me to make bad strategic decisions about products  customers and staff levels  Spending too much time on inorganic growth  M A   Expanding too rapidly to new geographies  I didn t want competitors to become entrenched   I could write my blog alone on the mistakes I made   But even more important than personal lessons of failure  I believe acceptance of failure at a societal level is one of the key ingredients that allows the technology startup industry in the US to flourish  I say this as somebody who has lived in 6 countries and worked in 9   having lived abroad for 11 years of my work life   In my experience the US loves the narrative of the come back  We champion a storyline about an underdog who failed many times but through grit and determination have risen above the odds  One of our greatest presidents   Abraham Lincoln   lived a lifetimes of failure and setbacks before being elected as president  1   One of our greatest technology leaders  Steve Jobs  had humiliating business failure before coming back to build the most successful tech come back of our times   Silicon Valley itself was built on the sciences with a foundation of trial and error and then improving the model and trying again  I believe this scientific method and trial and error approach is one of Silicon Valley s most valuable strengths   This came to mind a couple of years ago when I had the chance to sit down with the president of South Korea and she asked a small gathering of 19 tech   business leaders for opinions about how to make the Korean economy more  creative   The backdrop explained was that it was viewed that Korea has been tremendously successful at copying and perfecting other people s technologies but in order to compete more effective in the future had to be more creative   Of course as a non Korean I can only generalize but when it was my turn I told her my experience of living in Europe and Japan where failure seemed less tolerated than my experience of living in California and working in the tech sector  In London when founders failed they were ostracized in the press and culturally I believe it became harder to raise capital  Perhaps that s changed in the decade since I left but that was my experience when I lived there   In France in some ways it was worse because if you failed as a startup founder you shouldered personal liabilities that don t exist in the US under our bankruptcy laws  You also ran the risk that if you hired employees quickly and then demand wasn t as strong as expected it was incredibility hard to fire people  So founders took fewer risks and at the societal level with fewer companies taking fewer expansion risks job creation is weaker   Labor force inflexibility and personal liabilities are bound dampen the entrepreneurial risk taking and a society that shuns failure is likely to kill the entrepreneurial spirit   In my discussions with Korean friends they tell me that there is big pressure in Korea to work for large companies like Samsung over startups  this is similar to what I experienced in Japan  and that the more educated and hard working ones family was the more pressure to join a prestigious firm rather than starting a company or joining a startup  Many are no doubt trying to change this culture   People of Korean descent in Los Angeles are amongst the most entrepreneurial people I know   in technology but also in garments  fashion  food and so forth   So I wondered out loud with the president if the government wanted to encourage more entrepreneurship   was there a way to help promote more of a culture accepting of failure  After all  if people feel more of a safety net for trying and not succeeding more people are bound to try in the first place and more innovation is almost inevitable   Could government establish laws the encourage more risk taking knowing that the consequence of 98 failures but 2 massive successes were enough to transform industries and society and lead to both job and wealth creation   Could leaders of society try to change the culture in ways that encourage acceptance of failure  Could Korea s largest companies increase their funding of startups and provide them with initial business development deals as so often happens in Silicon Valley  Could big business accept its own creative destruction   I m not sure I know how societies can change to become more tolerant of failure but at a minimum an acknowledgement of a problem has got to be the starting point for making change   I feel strongly that lowering the bar for risk taking in all of its forms  liabilities  work force flexibility and de stigmatizing of businesses that don t succeed would inevitably lead to more innovation and more job creation   I was interviewed recently by Inc Magazine and they have been publishing snippets of this interview online  I was asked about this topic of failure and you can see my views in the short  one minute interview below   2,"[1325 710 1208 486 626 569
