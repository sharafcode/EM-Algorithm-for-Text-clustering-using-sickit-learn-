38,training-dataset/product/984.txt,product,How to Come Up with the Next Big AppAs smart phones continue to rise in popularity  so does the need for a more diverse array of smart phone apps  Because so many apps solve a variety of everyday problems  creating a multi million user app is the goal of countless entrepreenurs   But how does one go about conceiving an idea for an app that will attract a wide user base  In this syndicated post by Christian Thurston of Gigster  you will learn various methods to help you determine what kind of app you should build and how to get inspired   The article   How to Get New App Ideas   originally appeared on The Gigster Blog and has been republished below with permission   I work in tech  My sister doesn t  Over Christmas she came to visit me in San Francisco and this conversation happened   Sister   I want to build an app   Me   Really  What do you want to build   Sister   I don t know but I want to build one   My initial reaction was confusion  My sister uses tech and works in design so she is well integrated into the digital world but she s never shown an interest in building technology   Moreover it seemed backwards to me  Silicon Valley is firmly indoctrinated with the tenets of lean methodology which basically advises to scrappily solve any problem manually and only build tech when it makes sense or when your manual solution won t scale  An app is normally a means to an end and not the end in itself  Like riding on an airplane is about getting somewhere  not about riding the plane   Then I realized that if you haven t ever flown on a plane before then it actually makes sense to want to do that  Once you ve flown on enough planes the novelty is gone and you only fly for the destination  But in the beginning it make sense as a goal  So  for the benefit of not just my sister but all the folks out there who want to build an app here s a guide for coming up with app ideas   Apps   Businesses  Let s get this obvious point out of the way  There are plenty of apps that don t make money and aren t meant to  There are plenty of ways to make money that don t involve apps  Of course  the majority of app makers want to make money from their creations but it s not the sole reason people build apps to begin with  We ll touch on some of the business considerations in this post   Adaptation  The easiest and most obvious way to come up with app ideas is to look at what apps currently exist  There are several directions you can take this   Cloning  The least original approach to take but it can work  just ask the Samwer brothers   Inspiration  There s nothing wrong with borrowing concepts from popular apps out there and using them in a new way or for a new market  We hear plenty of analogies here at Gigster including people who want to build Tinder for X or Uber for Y   The concepts that drive these apps are the ones you want to emulate  Tinder simply turns a complex question  Who do you want to date   into a simple binary decision  yes or no by swiping  Likewise Uber is the concept of getting something quickly on demand  These concepts can be applied to different markets to create interesting apps   Just be aware of the limitations of this strategy  For example an on demand app works best for a service you both need often and quickly  A dental checkup doesn t qualify   Look at Crowded Spaces  Crowded spaces get a bad rap  Crowded spaces means competition and as Paul Graham rightly notes   You can only avoid competition by avoiding good ideas   So how do you win in a crowded space   You can take Dave McClure s advice and  niche to win   By focusing on a smaller subset of the larger market you can get a foothold and access a specific audience  By doing that you can make an app that is tailored to the unique needs of the audience in a way that the broader app can t   Also in crowded spaces you can go through the 1 star reviews of the biggest apps in that space and see what the common themes are  You ve now found the biggest pain point or dissatisfaction with current solutions and you can focus your app around those problems   This will often mean adding a feature but can also be as simple as better design  faster performance or even offering a free competitor to a paid app   Scratch Your Own Itch  Scratching your own itch is probably my favorite tactic of all  You instantly start with a user in mind   you  If nothing else you ll build something you ll use and the process of turning an idea into something you and other people can use is very rewarding   The app could be for your work  hobby or a small and quirky problem only you have  Have a process for keeping notes and getting into the habit of spotting problems you have in day to day life that you d like to see solved   Exercise Your Idea Muscle Every Day  Following on from the last idea is to turn app ideas into a daily habit  Think of it like a muscle that gets stronger every day as you exercise it  Don t try to come up with perfect ideas or even good ideas  Just focus on the process and you can t help but develop ideas you think are promising  Set a target to think of 20 new ideas a day  It ll be hard at first but over time you ll get better and better at it   The true challenge is to focus on executing on one idea even as you come up with new ones that seem more exciting  aka shiny object syndrome   For your first app pick the one that s the simplest and fastest to build an MVP version of and go from there   You can do this throughout the day when you re waiting in line for your coffee or you can do it as a 30 minute session at the same time everyday  You can keep a journal of all the things you did today and think about how an app could have helped make that experience better or replaced a current process you have for doing something   Imagine the Future and Then Build It  This is another piece of advice that comes from Paul Graham in his essay  How to Get Startup Ideas   A lot the advice there translates over to building apps  The general gist of this concept is to come up with ideas indirectly by immersing yourself in the near future and then working backwards to what you should build now   The challenge with this is that the ideas you have to build might seem too small or like it won t be relevant for today but new concepts are often like that  By the time everyone realizes the potential it has become the next big thing and you ll be playing catchup   Brainstorm with Friends  This is a fun dinner party approach to the problem  Get a bunch of friends together and tell them you re looking for app ideas to build  Get the ball rolling and see what ideas they have  Just make sure they fully understand you ll actually be building the idea so they can decide if they want to share their ideas with you  In general nobody should really worry about their idea being stolen but you don t want to risk losing a friend so just make sure everyone is on the same page with this approach  These folks will probably be your first users anyhow   Listening in on Social Media  There are plenty of social media listening tools out there like Mention and Hootsuite  You can use them to notice when people use certain phrases that indicate the need for a solution or opportunity that might be your next app idea  What phrases  Keywords like  I wish there was   or  I hate it when   are a good start   Find Problems  People use apps for all sorts of reasons  One of the most common reasons is to solve a problem they re having  The more problems you hear about the more app ideas you ll generate  Charities are set up to solve real world problems and it s no secret they re usually very resource constrained  You can talk to charities whose mission resonates strongly with you and see what apps they might want built  You can then take those on as projects   My sister loves animals so for her I d tell her to talk to charities that help animals and see what their needs are   Word Games  Most apps can be explained in a few short words  So let s focus on just the words  Take a few startup trends and hot spaces and make a list  this can include popular startups like Uber  Airbnb or Tinder   Then make a list of industries  One list will be the columns and the other list will be the rows  Combine an item from each list and you ve got the seed of a new idea   For example  Tinder   Real Estate   an app where renters discover properties by swiping on current listings  Landlords find tenants from swiping on their profiles  When you match you get to chat and go from there   Did we miss any approaches  Know some that should be on the list  Let us know on Twitter   Of course  the idea is just the first step  Next you ll have to validate it  if you plan on having a lot of users  and actually get it built  We can help with the building phase at Gigster    Start Up Business Launch Success Businessman Ideas Concept image by Shutterstock,"[38 882 840 1233 1181 623 217 1318 647

55,training-dataset/business/286.txt,business,Hybrid Business Models Look Ugly  but They WorkWhen the Microsoft Surface first appeared  many critics panned it as a clumsy move into hardware   a device that was stuck in the middle  a half step behind the hot market for tablets and only a half step beyond the dying market for PCs  When the Surface then took off and gave new life to the Microsoft turnaround  it seemed to reinforce the upside down logic of the company s digital transformation  However  what few people realized was that Microsoft leveraged an old but often overlooked tool that has remarkable power to manage such transitions   Over the centuries  firms have used hybrids to manage periods of difficult transition  In a recent article  we defined hybrids as combinations of competing elements or technical generations  for example  the Toyota Prius combines elements of internal combustion engines and electric cars  The advantage of hybrids is that they are a half step that can help their developers manage long and difficult transitions  such as the one between generations of technology or the transition between careers  The challenge of hybrids is that they are only temporary half steps  and so in retrospect they can look clumsy  Looking back at history  we can identify hybrids that bridged many of the major technology transitions  hybrid steam sailing ships  hybrid electric steam power plants  hybrid typewriter PCs  hybrid hard flash drives  hybrid cloud enterprise computing  and yes  hybrid laptops tablets in the form of the Microsoft Surface   A transition of another sort is now emerging and  in turn  demands a hybrid of another sort  In the digital world  platforms such as Amazon  Google  and Nest are king  How can firms create new platforms  or even better  turn their existing products into platforms  As my coauthor  Feng Zhu  and I note in our new HBR article  making that leap from product to platform can be treacherous   Insight Center The Platform Economy Sponsored by Accenture How online marketplaces are changing the face of business   At the core of successful leaps  we have observed a new type of hybrid  the hybrid product platform business models  Whereas product based business models create value by selling differentiated products to market niches  platform based business models create value by facilitating transactions across large  generic markets  Because product based and platform based models have many inherent tensions   niche versus mass market targets  asset versus transaction revenue model  differentiation versus network based competitive advantage  etc    prior work emphasizes that firms should choose to produce either products or platforms but not blend the two   However  in our research  we discovered the opposite was true  Firms successfully making the leap from product to platform employed business models combining the two elements  In particular  firms used their product revenues to support the emergence of the platform  slowly letting go of the product mindset as they shifted to a platform mindset   Some firms combine product and platform business models by using a product based business model to complement the emergence of a platform business model  For example  Valve Software focused on making video games until it discovered that hackers were illegally modifying those games  Rather than cracking down on the hackers  it hired the hackers  who then developed a second game for Valve  But the growing body of hackers created a second problem   how to facilitate gamers who wanted to play against each other when they might each have a different version of the product   In response  Valve built a platform called Steam to automatically update its games and make them compatible  Soon Valve realized it could use Steam to distribute any PC game  and having attracted a sizable user base for its own popular games  Valve built what is now the world s most popular platform for distributing PC games  Valve didn t quit making or selling its products  the games  but used them to complement the development of its platform  which employs a platform based business model of taking a cut of revenue from every game sold   Alternatively  some firms combine product and platform business models by using a product based business model to subsidize the development of a platform business model  For example  Qihoo  one of China s most successful internet firms  started out by making a security software product  However  realizing the real opportunity lay in platforms rather than products  Qihoo s CEO made the then controversial decision to give the product away for free  After amassing a huge user base  Qihoo then leveraged its user base and reputation for security to launch a platform that allowed users to purchase safe software from third party vendors  taking a cut on every sale  Qihoo didn t give up on its product but simply used it to subsidize the momentum needed to create a valuable platform   Adopting a hybrid business model does not mean that a firm will keep that business model forever  Sometimes  after successfully making the leap to platforms  firms may realize they need to abandon their old business model  But usually the greater challenge for leaders is letting go of the product mindset enough to embrace a hybrid business model and seeing that there may be more value in the platform than the product   Even Steve Jobs struggled with this  he is reported to have been skeptical of Apple s App Store  preferring to clamp down on the iPhone s security and void warranties rather than embrace the efforts of hackers to  jailbreak  the iPhone so they could install their own software  Of course  today  Apple still employs a hybrid business model  selling products  iPhones  that complement its platform  App Store,"[55 1367 402 1296 874 346 764 285 1170 412 913]"

127,training-dataset/product/469.txt,product,3 ways to be just pushy enough on mobileEditor s note  This is an excerpt from Mobilized  An Insider s Guide to the Business and Future of Connected Technology  by SC Moatti  You can read another excerpt here   The mobile revolution isn t simply a technological invention from which we can disconnect at any time  We can t disengage from the air we breathe or from the feet that carry us   Similarly  in today s world we can t disconnect from our mobile products  They are extensions of ourselves  For companies  it means focusing on delighting customers with a great mobile experience where context and privacy have a place   Be sticky  delight them or go home  Most of us have a fairly simple way to keep technology at bay when we want to distance ourselves from it  we walk away  We leave the office or factory at the end of the work day  we turn off the computer  we switch off the TV   But what about mobile products  Do we walk away from them the way we disconnect from most technology  We hope we can simply turn off our smartphones  but very few of us do  In fact  statistics show that 2 people out of 3 place their mobile devices on the nightstand next to their bed  It s the last thing we put down before we go to sleep and the first thing we check when we wake up   We re not being forced to sleep with our mobile devices within arm s reach  We want to do it  We don t want to be separated from it  It s become what s called a sticky technology  where we ve formed such a strong attachment to our mobile devices that our use of them is an ongoing  almost unconscious habit   Contrast that with the brutal fact that half of the smartphone apps in the Apple App Store don t have a single user  Businesses that want to succeed in mobile need to make sure that they build an experience that matches our high expectations   Get personal  context matters  With the mobile revolution  there is a lot more data about everything and everyone than ever before  And there is no going back   Take Facebook  During my time working there  my team conducted a test to determine if users would be open to receiving push notifications  We selected a group of users who had opted out of receiving push notifications  and showed them a screen immediately after they sent an instant message that explained to them the benefit of push notifications   What was especially tricky about our test was how much it required from the users to be successful it required 5 steps to change their settings  Typically  mobile companies lose 90 percent of their users with each step  so we weren t optimistic  But to our surprise  almost one in 4 users went ahead and changed their settings   What I found interesting about this that it reveals how quickly user behavior evolves on mobile  As recently as 6 months before we ran the test  a majority of Facebook users were skeptical about push notifications so they opted out of receiving them  They weren t quite sure what push notifications were or whether they had any value  Some felt a bit assaulted by them  And all of a sudden  people realized that push notifications allowed them to know instantly when a friend had posted a photo of them  or sent them a message  or tagged them in a post  So they wanted push notifications  What was appropriate earlier was no longer the norm   The amount of data available to mobile companies means that they can personalize the experience of each user to their mood  location  and context  Businesses that figure this out will win   Show respect  What if instead of a smartphone  our favorite mobile device was a watch  An earpiece  A pair of contact lenses  A smart patch  A smart pill  A digital nerve ending  As mobile devices shrink  they get more and more integrated into everyday objects around us and more and more deeply embedded within us   The abundance of information collected by our mobile devices is mostly helpful  though sometimes it can expose our private lives to a level of scrutiny that challenges our comfort level  The unprecedented level of personal exposure that the mobile revolution demands in order to function is relatively uncharted territory and will eventually need checks and balances   When government has had easy access to our personal information in the past  it has had nefarious consequences  surveillance states   enemies  lists  persecution of dissidents  In places like China  it s still a reality today   The same goes for commercial control of our personal data  The European debate around the  right to be forgotten  is an example of democracy in action  of people demanding more control of their digital selves   In fact  privacy loss is a topic that divides generations  Most millennials don t believe there s such a thing as privacy  many baby boomers feel that it s a right   The disappointing launch of Google Glass is an example of what can happen when a mobile product fails to manage expectations around privacy  Its power was seen as scary and out of the hands of its users  People felt it was built primarily to serve Google s own interests  that it was designed to collect data for the benefit of the tech giant rather than to serve the needs of its users  People wearing Google Glass were asked to leave bars  movie theaters  and casinos  The product was removed from the market at the beginning of 2015   To learn more about the formula for mobile success  including how to apply it to your own company  read my book  Mobilized  An Insider s Guide to the

135,training-dataset/product/123.txt,product,7 things to know about designing for virtual and augmented realityOver the past several years  virtual  VR  and augmented reality  AR  technology has proliferated beyond the gaming world and established a home in media  marketing  and education  among other industries   The rapid growth of this space has led to unforeseen innovation through the creation of immersive experiences that enhance the world around us or sometimes take us to a different world entirely  That said  these strides have not come without challenges  specifically when it comes to the way in which VR and AR experiences are designed and produced   We spoke with several experts to uncover a series of best practices to keep in mind before launching virtual and augmented reality projects  Whether you re a marketer  an entrepreneur  or a designer looking to hone your craft in this space  these tips will help guide you on the path to success   Don t lose sight of your objectives when chasing the next big thing  AR and VR experiences are powerful  but they should tie back to clear cut brand or business objectives  Before diving in  it s important to ask yourself why you want to pursue this type of media and what you would like the desired outcome to be  For example  if your goals are mass awareness  VR is likely not a good solution given low adoption rates  For a corporate training program at a technical company  it could be an incredibly powerful way to train a workforce   Ray Soto  Design Director of Emerging Technology at Gannett  works with editorial teams across the country to bring their reporting to life through interactive storytelling formats  The first thing his team does before embarking on an effort is determine that an immersive experience will bolster or enhance the story   There must be clear value in producing the content as an immersive experience rather than solely telling it through traditional means   he said   Upon passing that test  Soto says the next step is to determine which specific type of experience is right for the project  AR experiences add a layer onto the existing world  whereas VR experiences transport the user to a different world entirely  Moreover  selecting the right platform  meaning  the devices through which these experiences occur  is hugely important since it s difficult to optimize across devices and formats  As an example  an experience that s ripe for Google Cardboard a  15 device will not translate to one that s conducive to an HTC Vive  which markets for  800   USA Today s  Harvest of Change  story chronicled the changes Iowa farmers face with 360 video   Encourage clients to try before they buy  One of the biggest challenges inherent in VR and AR design is that most clients have a limited frame of reference when it comes to how these experiences should look or feel  When working in more traditional media formats print  TV  and even digital it can be assumed that clients have been interacting with similar content for years  On the other hand  immersive experiences like VR and AR are so new that many people lack the first hand experience needed to deliver actionable and constructive feedback   David Title  Chief Engagement Officer at Bravo Media  stresses that encouraging first hand experience among clients is a critical first step in any project   The most important element is to facilitate a personal experience   he said   Before launching any program  we ll show clients some similar examples and invite them to our office to try the technologies out for themselves  In these cases  watching videos or reading articles about VR and AR isn t sufficient    Related  Defining humane augmented reality user experiences  Shift your mindset to the world of  first person design   In one sense  the design challenges inherent in VR and AR are more philosophical than they are technical  As Title points out  these are the only true first person media formats that exist  and as such  they should be approached with an entirely different mindset    If you consider other media formats books  plays  shows  etc  each of those occur as a third person experience and the creator controls everything that a viewer experiences  hears  and feels   he said   On the contrary  in a virtual experience  the viewer is the first person  The creator of the media cannot control him or her nor should they try to    This all makes sense given that VR and AR activations are referred to as  experiences  instead of  spots  or  shows   Immersive experiences are non linear and non narrative  which means that creators must follow the rules of what Title calls  first person design     First person design means designing an experience for someone else to have   Title said   Of course this means the creator gives up a certain kind of control  but they are doing so in exchange for being able to create an experience that can do what no other platform or media format can do    First person design is important to VR experiences in particular  since the way things look or even sound can affect how the user ultimately feels  The environment should complement the story  and the story in turn should complement the environment    If something looks or sounds unfamiliar  our brains can throw us out of that immersive experience   Soto said   Consider spatial awareness  for example  If the space your experience occupies is too big  the user could get lost  Too small  and you risk creating a claustrophobic environment    Mike Dory  Managing Director at Spies   Assassins  the 100 person digital arm at KBS  adds that the best VR and AR efforts add to or enhance pre existing behaviors  For example  taking an interactive home tour or attending a virtual seminar    Do your homework to pick the right partner  One hurdle companies seeking AR and VR production services face is that the newness of the industry makes it difficult to parse the good from the bad  New immersive technologies pop up daily  and even the more  established  players have only been around for a few years  Title recommends focusing on a vendor s portfolio to determine if their capabilities match the ask    Nobody has a ton of work to show yet  but  vendors  should be able to share some sort of proof of concept work that demonstrates their capabilities   he said   It s worth asking to see proof work with elements that are similar to what you re trying to achieve    Layne Harris  VP of Innovation Technology at 360i  adds that clients seeking AR and VR design resources should vet partners for their spatial design skills  just as you would an interior designer  The agency s latest VR work includes building a vehicle simulator for Toyota that allows teens to experience the risks of distracted driving     With immersive formats   you have to take in a scene holistically   he said   Also  unlike gaming  VR is a slower medium and you want to give your users time to adjust to an environment  Select partners that have experience with 3D sound design  as sound can dramatically improve the sense of immersion    Another consideration is that immersive experiences like VR and AR reflect  and therefore require  a hybrid between design and code   You should to find a partner that combines great  developers  with great designers   Gannett s Soto said   In the early days of VR  the technological aspect of activations outshined the design and UX side  These days  design is catching up to tech    Utilize flexible design talent that can toggle between app and experience design  One of the clearest challenges content creators face in this space is that there are relatively few parallels between mobile and VR from a design standpoint  Most experienced interactive designers cut their teeth in the  mobile era   but are quickly finding out that immersive experiences like AR and VR reside in somewhat unchartered waters   Jordan Gurrieri  Founder and COO of VR AR app creation studio Blue Label Labs  says that while designers can apply some mobile learnings and best practices to VR  the teams creating these experiences will need to test new avenues to produce effective content  There are essentially 2 layers of design in most of these experience  app design  how to navigate to the experience  and experience design  how to navigate within it     Menu and breadcrumb navigation  content libraries  and settings and the like are necessary components of a VR experience   he said   What s tricky is that some are designed as part of the VR experience itself  like we seen with the Google Cardboard demo app  whereas others are kept within more traditional app experiences outside of  VR mode   Consequently  designers need to hone their skills across both environments    Set realistic timing expectations  The reality of the media and marketing industry is that projects can come up last minute  a late breaking event sponsorship opportunity  a heavily discounted ad spot during the Super Bowl  or other major event the list goes on  Anyone who has put in time at an agency or development shop has likely been on a project where the timelines are tight   Given the relative complexity of VR and AR projects  a rushed timeframe can lead to a subpar user experience  Experts recommend kicking these projects off 12 to 16 weeks ahead of the intended launch window as a general rule although it s not uncommon to kick off one to 3 months out and make creative concessions to meet a more aggressive deadline   Of course  there are a litany of variables that can impact the project timeline  For example  VR experiences can utilize 3D video capture  live footage shot for that specific project using a special camera  or 3D CG capture  existing  stock  assets that creators can purchase from a library   Live capture is oftentimes costlier and more time consuming given the time it takes to capture  edit and process   Beyond the more intricate design and development processes required for immersive experiences  the review process is also quite different for these types of projects compared to those of traditional formats   Editing and reviewing can be a challenge since the only way for clients to review is through a device   Bravo Media s Title said   One method of expediting this process involves setting up a mirrored version of the system you re developing on  so you can send updated cuts for clients to review remotely    Creating these virtual review environments is more important when developing for less portable platforms  e g  Oculus Rift or HTC Vive   When it comes to  mass  platforms  such as Google Cardboard  it s relatively easy to supply the client with the technology needed to review and provide feedback remotely  Regardless of the platform you re developing for  user testing should be critical step in the review process   Iterate  test  learn  and repeat  Bravo Media has been creating immersive experiences for more than decade  with innovative augmented reality campaigns for Kid Cudi and Black Eyed Peas rounding out the shop s early body of work  Since that time  the ubiquity of smartphones therefore mobile video technology has fundamentally changed the landscape  and continues to do so at a rapid pace   In 2015  Absolut live streamed a concert from Brooklyn s trendiest club to thousands of music lovers across the US    Everything we re dealing with is betaware   Title said   When it comes to VR and AR  technology is brought to market much faster than it would have years ago  Smaller companies are forcing the issue and pushing bigger players to release technologies that are powerful  but not without significant challenges    One way for brands and publishers to dive in without breaking the bank  adds 360i s Harris  is by building  small  bite sized experiences  to pilot how consumers respond to the experience before investing in a more fully fledged effort  And as clients are learning  designers and developers of these types of experiences are  too    There is yet to be a solid guide for UX best practices when it comes to VR development  and we are discovering more compelling ways to interact with VR worlds with every build that comes out   Harris said   Some things we know for sure  like don t move your horizon line or you will induce nausea  but how we interact with objects move around  engage with UI elements is still in its infancy    Though VR and AR design comes with its own unique set of challenges  such as designing for first person environments and capturing and or securing 360 degree footage  producers should use narrative as their North Star when it comes to bringing content to life    Everything seems to be the year of  something  and we ve decided that this is the year of VR   Dory said   From a  product  launch perspective I don t disagree  but immersive technology should not be viewed as a panacea for unwanted marketing ideas  People are seeking out experiences not technologies  It s all about the narrative,"[135 294 472 860 217 252 623 1302 810 594 447]"

permission to access it  This means that you can t simply access someone else s private status update without obtaining their permission  Seems logical  right   I started playing around with this feature  Most of the time  I got an error message that the object either did not exist or that I did not have permission to view it   No permission to access 39402139014  As I was about to give up   a URL popped up  Cool  but this left me none the wiser  you can t do much with a timestamp and a string that says   website    A website  How s that an object in Facebook   Then I appended  url  to my initial request  asking Facebook if it would be so nice as to display the link address as well  To my surprise  this worked   Apparently someone visited this URL from Facebook back in 2013 when it was still online  At this point  I wondered if I could also use this to view links users privately shared  so I asked my friend Bas to help me out  create a Google doc and privately share the link  Here s what I received   Bas  side  An example of a Google Document with confidential information  Then I asked Bas to use Facebook messenger to send the link to himself and click on it   Bas  side  sharing the link with himself on messenger  Harmless  right   Since the link was saved to Facebook s database when Bas opened the link via Messenger  I asked him to use Facebook debugger tool to get the object identification number and provide it to me   Bas side  the URL was scraped when it got clicked  The tool also showed the number identifier attached to the post   The number identifier was another number someone could have guessed or stumbled upon  Back to my account  When I tried to access the object attached to the number above  the URL popped up   On my side  enter a number  get a link  Moments later  I was able to access the confidential Google document   My view  successfuly  hacked  into Bas  secret document  I tried to reproduce this a couple of times until I decided to find out whether it was also possible to get other people s  private  links exploiting this  I wrote a quick script that would take any identification number and increment it gradually to discover other links  It worked   A script I wrote to extract links from Facebook  For this example  I checked all the links to make sure they weren t confidential  While the results did not include an ID for the user who shared the link  I was able to identify some because their user id  the number corresponding to their account  was included in the link   Why this is a big deal  While you may only share links to funny cat videos with your friends  you should still be worried about this exploit  Sometimes  sensitive information  personal data  secret keys     are included in links without you even noticing  Just take a look at the redacted and quite innocent looking links from earlier   In this small set of extracted URL s  I ve already found some interesting info   Names   Heather  Jenny

162,training-dataset/business/1049.txt,business,How Amazon s Battle with Netflix is Teaching us to Rethink CompetitionHow Amazon s Battle with Netflix is Teaching us to Rethink Competition  For many years now we ve seen the dangers of defining your business too narrowly  Think about Borders  which pioneered the book megastore model  Rather than using the Internet s rise to consider how new technologies or business models could allow it to better satisfy customers  jobs to be done  it defined itself as a bookseller  When times got tough  it doubled down on trying to sell more of the items its customers happened to be buying   books  CDs  and DVDs  It last turned a profit in 2006 before ultimately declaring bankruptcy and closing its doors in 2011  Online retailer Amazon now reigns supreme in the space   Defining your competition narrowly creates the same results  Blockbuster focused its attention on what it deemed to be the real competition   companies like Hollywood Video  It was certainly aware of Netflix  the company that ultimately disrupted the industry   but turned down an opportunity to buy it for a mere  50 million back in 2000  Blockbuster determined that Netflix was a  very small niche business  occupying a small corner of the market that mattered little to the giant  Over time  Netflix s offering improved  the company moved up market  and it redefined the way customers thought about video rentals  In addition to stealing market share  Netflix essentially mooted one of Blockbuster s primary forms of revenue  In the very year that Blockbuster decided not to acquire Netflix  the company made a staggering 16  of its revenues from late fees   a concept that ceased to exist as Netflix changed the game   Interestingly  while both Amazon and Netflix slayed incumbent behemoths in their respective industries back in the 2000s  those disruptors are now competing with each other  even though they operate in seemingly different industries  But competition can no longer be defined in the traditional sense  i e   those who happen to be selling the same goods or services that you re selling   Rather  companies compete with anyone else who can satisfy the jobs that customers are trying to get done in their lives  They compete with businesses that can cause customers to spend their finite resources somewhere else  The Snickers bar in the checkout aisle competes not just with other candy bars  but also with the smartphone app that s diverting the supermarket customer s attention and obviating the need for an impulse purchase  Nike competes with other shoe makers such as Adidas and New Balance  but it is also in indirect competition with other products that offer customers a way to express themselves   In this case  Amazon and Netflix are offering products that do look fairly similar  at least in some respects  Netflix offers a subscription to a library of movies and TV shows for around  100 per year  At a similar price point  Amazon offers its Prime membership  which  in addition to giving Amazon shoppers free two day shipping  also gives members access to Prime Video   a digital collection of movies and TV shows  Now sure  Netflix could argue that Amazon is still a relatively small player in the video streaming industry  It could argue that Prime Video has a smaller selection of videos  less precise data about what users like  less advanced tools for categorizing and recommending new videos  and less established relationships with other industry players  It could argue   much as Blockbuster did some fifteen years ago   that Amazon is really more of a niche player in the industry  whose focus is really on retail  But Netflix would be foolish to do so   Ironically  the fact that Amazon s primary focus is in another industry is perhaps what should worry Netflix the most  First  Amazon can worry less about its margins with respect to Prime Video because it s not a core source of revenue for the company  Amazon s primary sources of revenue are its core retail business and Amazon Web Services  Amazon doesn t need to worry about the costs of licensing content or marketing Prime Video  Second  Amazon has a huge incentive to build interest in Prime Video  According to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos  Prime Video makes individuals more likely to pay for Amazon Prime and to renew their Amazon Prime memberships  Amazon Prime members  in turn  spend more than the average non Prime customer  By creating a better Prime Video offering  Amazon is able to sell more books or shoes or other goods  Amazon has a real incentive to see Prime Video succeed   It may well turn out that Netflix and Amazon learn to live together in harmony  Customers may ultimately choose to have both an Amazon Prime membership  complete with its Prime Video benefits  and a Netflix subscription  But as Prime Video continues to creep up market  steadily increasing in performance along the dimensions that matter most to consumers  e g   better selection  the ability to download shows for offline viewing   Netflix certainly has something to worry about  Given its own status as an industry disruptor  we can be sure that Netflix is looking beyond just incremental improvements to its subscription offering to ensure its long term health   Learn more  To learn more about how understanding customers  jobs to be done can help companies think differently about competition and preemptively fend off potential disruptors  check out the page for our new book Jobs to be Done  A Roadmap for Customer Centered Innovation  We offer a detailed look at Jobs to be Done thinking  a sample chapter  and several tools and frameworks that we feature in the book,"[162 926 947 765 1256

173,training-dataset/business/241.txt,business,Apple s Mistake        Want to start a startup  Get funded by Y Combinator   November 2009    I don t think Apple realizes how badly the App Store approval process is broken  Or rather  I don t think they realize how much it matters that it s broken     The way Apple runs the App Store has harmed their reputation with programmers more than anything else they ve ever done  Their reputation with programmers used to be great  It used to be the most common complaint you heard about Apple was that their fans admired them too uncritically  The App Store has changed that  Now a lot of programmers have started to see Apple as evil     How much of the goodwill Apple once had with programmers have they lost over the App Store  A third  Half  And that s just so far  The App Store is an ongoing karma leak              How did Apple get into this mess  Their fundamental problem is that they don t understand software     They treat iPhone apps the way they treat the music they sell through iTunes  Apple is the channel  they own the user  if you want to reach users  you do it on their terms  The record labels agreed  reluctantly  But this model doesn t work for software  It doesn t work for an intermediary to own the user  The software business learned that in the early 1980s  when companies like VisiCorp showed that although the words  software  and  publisher  fit together  the underlying concepts don t  Software isn t like music or books  It s too complicated for a third party to act as an intermediary between developer and user  And yet that s what Apple is trying to be with the App Store  a software publisher  And a particularly overreaching one at that  with fussy tastes and a rigidly enforced house style     If software publishing didn t work in 1980  it works even less now that software development has evolved from a small number of big releases to a constant stream of small ones  But Apple doesn t understand that either  Their model of product development derives from hardware  They work on something till they think it s finished  then they release it  You have to do that with hardware  but because software is so easy to change  its design can benefit from evolution  The standard way to develop applications now is to launch fast and iterate  Which means it s a disaster to have long  random delays each time you release a new version     Apparently Apple s attitude is that developers should be more careful when they submit a new version to the App Store  They would say that  But powerful as they are  they re not powerful enough to turn back the evolution of technology  Programmers don t use launch fast and iterate out of laziness  They use it because it yields the best results  By obstructing that process  Apple is making them do bad work  and programmers hate that as much as Apple would     How would Apple like it if when they discovered a serious bug in OS X  instead of releasing a software update immediately  they had to submit their code to an intermediary who sat on it for a month and then rejected it because it contained an icon they didn t like     By breaking software development  Apple gets the opposite of what they intended  the version of an app currently available in the App Store tends to be an old and buggy one  One developer told me  As a result of their process  the App Store is full of half baked applications  I make a new version almost every day that I release to beta users  The version on the App Store feels old and crappy  I m sure that a lot of developers feel this way  One emotion is  I m not really proud about what s in the App Store   and it s combined with the emotion  Really  it s Apple s fault   Another wrote  I believe that they think their approval process helps users by ensuring quality  In reality  bugs like ours get through all the time and then it can take 4 8 weeks to get that bug fix approved  leaving users to think that iPhone apps sometimes just don t work  Worse for Apple  these apps work just fine on other platforms that have immediate approval processes  Actually I suppose Apple has a third misconception  that all the complaints about App Store approvals are not a serious problem  They must hear developers complaining  But partners and suppliers are always complaining  It would be a bad sign if they weren t  it would mean you were being too easy on them  Meanwhile the iPhone is selling better than ever  So why do they need to fix anything     They get away with maltreating developers  in the short term  because they make such great hardware  I just bought a new 27  iMac a couple days ago  It s fabulous  The screen s too shiny  and the disk is surprisingly loud  but it s so beautiful that you can t make yourself care     So I bought it  but I bought it  for the first time  with misgivings  I felt the way I d feel buying something made in a country with a bad human rights record  That was new  In the past when I bought things from Apple it was an unalloyed pleasure  Oh boy  They make such great stuff  This time it felt like a Faustian bargain  They make such great stuff  but they re such assholes  Do I really want to support this company              Should Apple care what people like me think  What difference does it make if they alienate a small minority of their users     There are a couple reasons they should care  One is that these users are the people they want as employees  If your company seems evil  the best programmers won t work for you  That hurt Microsoft a lot starting in the 90s  Programmers started to feel sheepish about working there  It seemed like selling out  When people from Microsoft were talking to other programmers and they mentioned where they worked  there were a lot of self deprecating jokes about having gone over to the dark side  But the real problem for Microsoft wasn t the embarrassment of the people they hired  It was the people they never got  And you know who got them  Google and Apple  If Microsoft was the Empire  they were the Rebel Alliance  And it s largely because they got more of the best people that Google and Apple are doing so much better than Microsoft today     Why are programmers so fussy about their employers  morals  Partly because they can afford to be  The best programmers can work wherever they want  They don t have to work for a company they have qualms about     But the other reason programmers are fussy  I think  is that evil begets stupidity  An organization that wins by exercising power starts to lose the ability to win by doing better work  And it s not fun for a smart person to work in a place where the best ideas aren t the ones that win  I think the reason Google embraced  Don t be evil  so eagerly was not so much to impress the outside world as to inoculate themselves against arrogance    1      That has worked for Google so far  They ve become more bureaucratic  but otherwise they seem to have held true to their original principles  With Apple that seems less the case  When you look at the famous 1984 ad now  it s easier to imagine Apple as the dictator on the screen than the woman with the hammer    2   In fact  if you read the dictator s speech it sounds uncannily like a prophecy of the App Store  We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts     We have created  for the first time in all history  a garden of pure ideology  where each worker may bloom secure from the pests of contradictory and confusing truths  The other reason Apple should care what programmers think of them is that when you sell a platform  developers make or break you  If anyone should know this  Apple should  VisiCalc made the Apple II     And programmers build applications for the platforms they use  Most applications most startups  probably grow out of personal projects  Apple itself did  Apple made microcomputers because that s what Steve Wozniak wanted for himself  He couldn t have afforded a minicomputer    3   Microsoft likewise started out making interpreters for little microcomputers because Bill Gates and Paul Allen were interested in using them  It s a rare startup that doesn t build something the founders use     The main reason there are so many iPhone apps is that so many programmers have iPhones  They may know  because they read it in an article  that Blackberry has such and such market share  But in practice it s as if RIM didn t exist  If they re going to build something  they want to be able to use it themselves  and that means building an iPhone app     So programmers continue to develop iPhone apps  even though Apple continues to maltreat them  They re like someone stuck in an abusive relationship  They re so attracted to the iPhone that they can t leave  But they re looking for a way out  One wrote  While I did enjoy developing for the iPhone  the control they place on the App Store does not give me the drive to develop applications as I would like  In fact I don t intend to make any more iPhone applications unless absolutely necessary    4   Can anything break this cycle  No device I ve seen so far could  Palm and RIM haven t a hope  The only credible contender is Android  But Android is an orphan  Google doesn t really care about it  not the way Apple cares about the iPhone  Apple cares about the iPhone the way Google cares about search              Is the future of handheld devices one locked down by Apple  It s a worrying prospect  It would be a bummer to have another grim monoculture like we had in the 1990s  In 1995  writing software for end users was effectively identical with writing Windows applications  Our horror at that prospect was the single biggest thing that drove us to start building web apps     At least we know now what it would take to break Apple s lock  You d have to get iPhones out of programmers  hands  If programmers used some other device for mobile web access  they d start to develop apps for that instead     How could you make a device programmers liked better than the iPhone  It s unlikely you could make something better designed  Apple leaves no room there  So this alternative device probably couldn t win on general appeal  It would have to win by virtue of some appeal it had to programmers specifically     One way to appeal to programmers is with software  If you could think of an application programmers had to have  but that would be impossible in the circumscribed world of the iPhone  you could presumably get them to switch     That would definitely happen if programmers started to use handhelds as development machines if handhelds displaced laptops the way laptops displaced desktops  You need more control of a development machine than Apple will let you have over an iPhone     Could anyone make a device that you d carry around in your pocket like a phone  and yet would also work as a development machine  It s hard to imagine what it would look like  But I ve learned never to say never about technology  A phone sized device that would work as a development machine is no more miraculous by present standards than the iPhone itself would have seemed by the standards of 1995     My current development machine is a MacBook Air  which I use with an external monitor and keyboard in my office  and by itself when traveling  If there was a version half the size I d prefer it  That still wouldn t be small enough to carry around everywhere like a phone  but we re within a factor of 4 or so  Surely that gap is bridgeable  In fact  let s make it an RFS  Wanted  Woman with hammer                 Notes      1   When Google adopted  Don t be evil   they were still so small that no one would have expected them to be  yet       2   The dictator in the 1984 ad isn t Microsoft  incidentally  it s IBM  IBM seemed a lot more frightening in those days  but they were friendlier to developers than Apple is now       3   He couldn t even afford a monitor  That s why the Apple I used a TV as a monitor       4   Several people I talked to mentioned how much they liked the iPhone SDK  The problem is not Apple s products but their policies  Fortunately policies are software  Apple can change them instantly if they want to  Handy that  isn t it     Thanks to Sam Altman  Trevor

217,training-dataset/business/1412.txt,business,The Next Great Platform is the One That We Already HaveThe Next Great Platform is the One That We Already Have  You hear it all the time  Mobile is over  The app boom is finished  The average American downloads zero apps per month  okay  maybe 1 5 apps per month    so it s time to start thinking about the  next big thing    Of course  nobody really means that mobile is  over   just that all the big opportunities have already been grabbed  The thinking is that  with Facebook  Snapchat  Instagram  Whatsapp  WeChat  and Twitter out there  and no one downloading many apps any more  there s just no room for something new  It s too late  Don t bother trying to do something great in mobile   instead  figure out what the next big thing is and get on that   So everybody is sitting around talking about what the next great platform might be  Is it augmented reality  Virtual reality  Drones  Robots  Artificial intelligence   Here s my take  All of this  it s over  talk has happened before  and all this will happen again  Looking back to 2002 2004  we all felt that the consumer Internet was played out  Nobody was starting consumer companies  Yahoo  and AOL were the dominant portals  Amazon had staked its claim on the e commerce world  Google was well on its way to search engine dominance  a bunch of ridiculous dot coms had met their deserving fates  and there didn t seem to be much room for anything else  We were waiting for the next big thing after the Web   And yet that s exactly when Web 2 0 started happening  In the space of a few years  all of the giants of today s social world got their start  They didn t depend on any major new technology breakthroughs to become successful  Friendster  then LinkedIn  MySpace  and YouTube  then Facebook   they all came out of basically the same platform as the companies in the dot com boom   It was all user generated content  There was no massive wave of platform change  except to the extent that there were more people getting online  There was a demographic shift  more people  followed by a social shift and a psychological shift  Sites like MySpace  LinkedIn  and Friendster took off because they met these new  fundamental needs in a way that no sites had done before   Sure  there was some new technology in the early 2000s  AJAX  Asynchronous JavaScript And XML  made a much more interactive  responsive user experience possible  and many startups took advantage of this to improve their UX and differentiate themselves from older sites  The LAMP stack  Linux  Apache  MySQL  and PHP  dramatically reduced the costs of building a scalable website  compared to the expensive HP servers and Oracle databases that went before  But it s worth noting that both AJAX and LAMP were essentially refinements and additions to existing Web technologies  They weren t totally new platforms   they were improvements   So when I look at today s consumer mobile landscape  I see things like Pok mon Go becoming a fast phenomenon  and it s clear that it s not succeeding thanks to some radical new technology or new platform  People call Pok mon Go  augmented reality  but it s really just a fairly simple superimposition of images on top of the camera display  In early versions of iOS apps couldn t draw graphics directly on top of a live camera image  but Apple removed that restriction  and now Pok mon Go is possible  But that s a technology tweak  an incremental improvement  not a great leap forward  It s a team that has been working on similar problems like this for a long time and having it all come together  Sure  they were able to take advantage of a beloved brand which helped them get a big launch  But it has worked well beyond just the strength of the Pokemon brand because they built something unique  different  and fun  I ve never seen so many people wandering around together with their phones out and talking to each other   What happened in the Web 2 0 era was that some companies succeeded in creating totally new experiences  engaging consumers  and enabling them to connect with other people in a way that had never happened before online   Now that we re in a fully mobile world  I think there is a lot of room to create new experiences and connect people  What are the kinds of experiences that aren t happening yet in mobile  What core needs do people have now that aren t being met by our current crop of mobile and social apps   It s worth remembering that the global app market could be generating  100 billion in revenue by 2020  according to App Annie  with continued growth across the board  even in mature markets  So mobile is far from dead   If you look at the apps that break out and rise to the top of the app store rankings  apart from games   they tend to offer something compelling to consumers  There have been a number of new apps that have broken out to the top 5 of the App Store for iPhone for at least a week this year  Generally  getting to that level means you receive over a million downloads in that period if not several millions   These all have let people do something new with their phones  They all spread virally and grew rapidly  Whether or not these grow to become platforms of the future is still a question  but that doesn t deny the proof that people are interested in downloading apps and trying them  Getting apps to stick is another issue   but getting people to try it is a necessary first step  Here are just a few examples of these  quick hit  apps that peaked in some week in 2016   MSQRD  app to create fun images via new  lenses   grew very rapidly as a better version of Snapchat s lenses before Facebook purchased it earlier in the year   Miitomo  people create avatars and can then interact with each other  grew after promotion from Nintendo   HouseParty  app that allows groups of up to 6 to video chat with each other  grew rapidly through word of mouth before some scaling issues set in   Kiwi  app to ask and answer questions anonymously  spread rapidly among teens via viral invitations and influencer promotions   Prisma  lets people make beautiful  stained glass style art from their photos   growing as people discover the app through Instagram  Facebook  and Twitter   Bitmoji  gives people a way to create their own expressive sticker emoji  grew for many years  acquired and integrated by Snapchat   In general  these apps all do one of two things    1  give people a way to express themselves visually  by creating art  stickers  or even avatars that make interacting with their friends more fun and expressive   2  connect and communicate in new ways  These both have pretty universal demand   and the interest in even downloading and exploring them shows there are many opportunities not solved by the biggest companies  That said  it takes a lot of work to make something sticky and long term   one can still question whether that s possible in this era of large companies and networks   As I wrote earlier this year  there are a few other areas where current offerings aren t meeting people s needs well enough yet  There s no good solution for live conversation  particularly with groups of people  There needs to be something with the simplicity and fun of Slack  but for groups of people outside work  I miss the old AOL s ease of finding interest groups  collections of like minded people to hang out with  And I wish there were better tools for managing and preserving the zillions of photos we are all creating and uploading   But these ideas are just a start  In reality  there are probably hundreds of core needs that aren t being met by mobile today  but which could be   I don t think we need to wait for a new platform to make these kinds of magical new experiences happen  We don t just need VR AR etc to take off  I think it can happen and will happen on mobile  I think Pokemon Go is a beacon for how different  new  and fun new experiences can still be on mobile  And I think some inventions in the next couple of years on our existing platforms are going to be revolutionary  If you are building something like this  let me

239,training-dataset/business/1052.txt,business,Don t confuse  I don t like it  with  That s a bad product and it ll fail  at andrewchenBenedict Evans at a16z recently tweeted the following   There s so much truth in this tweet  And it resonates so much  I think it deserves a name   The Bad Product Fallacy  Your personal use cases and opinion are a shitty predictor of a product s future success   I ve been in the Bay Area for 10 years now  and nothing stings more than whiffing on the prediction of whether a product will be success  Getting this wrong can hurt the ego and sometimes the checkbook too   just ask the dozens of investors who ve passed on Facebook  Google  Uber  and so on  Personally  I missed completely on Facebook s potential  and that s just one of many bad predictions over the years   The Bad Product Fallacy happens because the trajectory of a product evolves quickly   it s just software  after all   and a simple set of features can quick grow into a rich  complex platform over time   Let s look at some of the comment root causes of the Bad Product Fallacy   It all starts with a toy  The first and most well studied root cause of the Bad Product Fallacy is from the theory of disruptive innovation  Many products can look like toys before they become successful  Just take Instagram as an example   it was just a photo filters app at the beginning  and is now one of the largest media properties in the world  Or personal computers  which was initially meant for hobbyists since they were underpowered and weren t useful for business applications   This whole phenomenon   widely studied as disruptive innovation theory by Harvard s Clayton Christensen   is nicely summarized in this blurb   Disruptive technologies are dismissed as toys because when they are first launched they  undershoot  user needs  The first telephone could only carry voices a mile or two  The leading telco of the time  Western Union  passed on acquiring the phone because they didn t see how it could possibly be useful to businesses and railroads   their primary customers    Chris Dixon  gp at a16z  Here s now you know you might be falling for this trap  If you use a new product for the first time and say   huh  is that all there is   then you may just be whiffing  Or if you complain about a lack of features  even as the underlying technologies are being upgraded extremely rapidly   Just wait a couple years  by then  the product will have improved so much that you ll realize you got it all wrong   Moore s Law for everything  The inverse of disruptive innovation is that products can start out super premium  but then quickly fall in price to find success in a large  mainstream market  The iPhone is the classic example  but Tesla  Uber  and others are pulling this off too  Sometimes there s a Moore s Law kind of effect  where things are getting enormously better and cheaper over time   Let s look at the iPhone  the classic example  Steve Ballmer made a very bad prediction   when asked about the new device  he laughed  Not a threat  Instead  he explained why the iPhone would fail   500 dollars  Fully subsidized  With a plan  I said that is the most expensive phone in the world  And it doesn t appeal to business customers because it doesn t have a keyboard  Which makes it not a very good email machine   Steve Ballmer  Microsoft on the iPhone  Funny  right  Hindsight is 20 20  Or speaking of phones  here s another funny example  but about mobile phones in general   In the early 1980s AT T asked McKinsey to estimate how many cellular phones would be in use in the world at the turn of the century  The consultancy noted all the problems with the new devices the handsets were absurdly heavy  the batteries kept running out  the coverage was patchy and the cost per minute was exorbitant and concluded that the total market would be about 900 000  At the time this persuaded AT T to pull out of the market  although it changed its mind later    The Economist  Oct 1999  But of course  mobile phones as a luxury was quickly fixed  By making the cost per minute cheap and fixing the other technical issues  the mobile phone has become the most ubiquitous computing device in the world   Here s how you know you re about to commit this flavor of the Bad Product Fallacy  If you try a product and ask  Why would anyone pay so much for this   then you need to think through what happens if the service product becomes much  much cheaper  Or if it turns out that consumers don t mind the price  Thinking through these trends can change the game   I ve myself missed here when looking at Uber in their early years  When Uber first came out  I thought  wow   why would anyone need an app to call a limo  This is a fancy person s problem  But of course  if you can get the pricing down from a limo to a taxi  then cheaper to a taxi  and one day cheaper than owning a car   well that s potentially a trillion dollar company  It turns out there s some kind of Moore s Law effect for the cost of transportation over time  and now I m working there     S0me products start by selling stamps  coins  and comic books  Marketplaces have their own flavor of this fallacy because they often start with a vertical niche where buyers sellers gather  and slowly need to grow to new verticals to be relevant  If these initial niches aren t your jam  then you may miss on the marketplace s potential  even if its on a trajectory to ultimately grow into areas that you ll find useful too   The classic example of this is eBay  Bessemer Ventures had the chance to invest  but at the time  the marketplace had a lot of collectibles  Here was their evaluation    Stamps  Coins  Comic books  You ve GOT to be kidding   thought Cowan   No brainer pass     Bessemer Venture Partners  Anti Portfolio page  Of course  eBay went on to add many new verticals  from cars to electronics to much more  eventually returning 700X to their original investors   The tricky thing here is that you may not want to buy products that are in the marketplace s initial verticals  which means the product won t serve your use cases or you won t love it  However  if you wait a couple years  the marketplace may eventually grow into product categories that you care about   Social networks and content platforms need density  penetration  to become useful  Finally  let s look at social communication UGC networks which have their own issues  These platforms can be super tricky because similar to marketplaces  they need time to mature as the networks form   The often cited 1 9 90 rule for digital communities fundamentally drives this dynamic   The 1  rule states that the number of people who create content on the Internet represents approximately 1  of the people actually viewing that content  For example  for every person who posts on a forum  generally about 99 other people are viewing that forum but not posting   Wikipedia   This means that  similar to marketplaces  you need the right balance of content creators and consumers in every vertical of content to have a functioning network  If a social communications product like Snapchat is only useful when you have  5 friends using it  you ll inherently misunderstand it if the core market is teens and not 40 year old venture capitalists  If you tried using the Internet back in 1990  you may have decided that it d never work since it s all academic researchers   Today  you may be skeptical about VR because it s mostly games and the apps you d really like to use haven t been developed yet  But just wait  it might all click once the right dynamic of content creators  consumers  developers  and other constituents are at the table   Similar to marketplaces  social networks  communications tools  and user generated content platforms need critical masses of both creators and consumers to make things work  Sometimes this starts with a niche   like college students or San Francisco techies  But if a product can nail an initial vertical and start hitting up other ones  it may be on its way to mainstream success  Don t judge too early   Avoiding the Bad Product Fallacy  In the end  we all love to use our own personal judgement to quickly say yes or no to products  But the Bad Product Fallacy says our own opinions are terrible predictors of success  because tech is changing so quickly   So instead  I leave you with a couple questions to ask when you are looking at a new product   If it looks like a toy   what happens if it s successful with its initial audience and then starts to add a lot more features     what happens if it s successful with its initial audience and then starts to add a lot more features  If it looks like a luxury   what happens if it becomes much cheaper  Or much better  at the same price     what happens if it becomes much cheaper  Or much better  at the same price  If it s a marketplace that doesn t sell anything you d buy   what happens when it starts stocking products and services you find valauble     what happens when it starts stocking products and services you find valauble  If none of your friends use a social product  what happens when they win a niche and ultimately all your friends are using it too   It s hard to ask these questions  since they mostly imply nonlinear trajectories in product innovation  However  technology rarely progresses in a straight line   they grow exponentially  whether in utility  price performance  or in network effect  Ask yourself the above questions to stay centered  and if you use it to find the next Uber or Facebook  give me  and Ben   a holler     I write a high quality  weekly newsletter covering what s happening in Silicon Valley  focused on startups  marketing

252,training-dataset/product/96.txt,product,Mobile first  Insights from going mobile onlyNo matter how much I want to believe we re all up to speed on mobile first design  there are still many experiences that are lagging behind  This is something that needs to change  Especially considering over 25  of the world is not only mobile first  but is mobile only  according to a recent trends report by UX Magazine   I recently went a month without a computer to see what life was like without the machine that we re all so attached to  You can read more about the story in my article  The Computer less Month   By forcing myself to not only be mobile first  but mobile only  I learned a lot about mobile first best practices  Here are some insights I hope help you create better mobile experiences   1  Make navigation easy  According to a study by Nielsen Norman Group  a global leader in user experience research  training  and consulting  hidden navigation patterns  like hamburger menus  decrease content discoverability by 21  and increase the amount of time it takes to actually use the navigation by 2 seconds  on average   This decrease in usability happens for one of 2 reasons   The hamburger menu is used so much that we start to ignore it Think about your front door  Do you know the color of your front door  You might implicitly know what color it is but if you had to tell someone about your house and they asked you what color your front door is  would you know  Like our front doors  hamburger navs have become so familiar to us that we don t even see them anymore  When people don t know what s hidden in the nav they scroll the page to see if they can find what they re looking for first  Opening a nav is a commitment  And what if when I open it I don t find what I m looking for  Research shows users would rather take their chances and scroll the page before diving into your hamburger nav   While a fully visible nav that shows all possible links at once is the best navigational pattern you can create  it s simply just not feasible most of the time on mobile with the limited amount of screen realty  The best navigational pattern to use on mobile is a combo navigation   A combo navigation allows the user to see the options they need the most and makes the rest accessible in a hamburger menu or something similar  Apple s site does this really well   The site s content is laid out so well that I don t need nav buttons  I can scroll the page and get where I want very easily  but a  buy now  button is always visible and available in case I decide I want to purchase   And if I can t find what I need after scanning the page  I can always dig deeper in the nav to discover what s available   Together  the combo navigation pattern and the well thought out content within the pages of Apple s site are a great example of how to create the best mobile experience for your users   2  Design for thumbs  There s plenty of research on the Thumb Zone  yet many sites and apps still keep their navigation at the top of the screen   Why  Because everyone else is doing it  so it must be the best way to do it  right  Well it s not   If you look at the Thumb Zone  you can see that the bigger the device  the harder it is for users to reach content at the outer edges of the screen  Keep this in mind when you re designing   If you look at the Safari Browser  the Google Now app  or well crafted mobile websites like Pitchfork  you ll notice that the main navigation is at the bottom of the screen   We re seeing mobile experiences  even on the web  move their navigation to the bottom a place that s easier for users to reach  This is something we re only going to see more of as mobile usage continues to grow YoY   3  Make clicks meaningful  There s this fallacy that floats around the UX world telling everyone that less clicks means a better experience  And if users don t have to click  well  then the person that created it must be some sort of UX god  Well  here s the truth  Users won t mind extra clicks as long as they re meaningful   Got a long set of forms that need to be filled out  Break them into individual forms to make users focus on what they need to do  Fill in forms for your users wherever you can  based on info they entered into previous forms  Change the keyboard so the default for that form makes filling it out faster continuously flipping keyboards is a pain in the ass  And give your users a status bar that shows them how far along they are in the process  Knowing there s an end somewhere is huge   Each task your users complete will give them a sense of accomplishment  especially if they can watch how much they ve completed add up  The fact that users can do everything faster than normal because your experience is based on the context of the interaction only multiplies their sense of accomplishment and  in return  their love for your experience   It sounds counterintuitive  but you can reduce complexity by adding in a few extra meaningful clicks  Each tiny bite is much less of a cognitive load for your users than if you push everything on them up front  Make your experiences contextual based and digestible  and no one will notice that it took them a few extra clicks because it felt necessary   4  Make content digestible  Think of what happens when you go to a restaurant and open a menu  Are you quicker to make a decision when the menu has 10 items with pictures next to them or is it easier when you have 4 pages of 50  potential items to read through   There s a reason Google chose to make card based design their standard and the rest of the web has slowly adapted  Each card represents a digestible piece of related information typically defined by a headline  an image or graphic  and a short string of text that gives you a general overview  This style gives users just enough information to decide whether they want to explore deeper or move on in a very short amount of time   Just because you have a lot to tell your users doesn t mean they want to spend their time scrolling through pages of content to make a decision  No one wants to read the whole story  Your paragraphs of technical jargon are made for internal purposes  Hire a copywriter to help you focus your content into something users will actually read  And don t be scared to give bullet points so users can read  understand  and move on   Give your users the high level overview initially  then progressively give more information as they dig deeper just enough to keep them interested and moving forward  but not so much that they become bogged down   When it comes to content  be that gourmet restaurant that knows what you want before you do  Use your analytics to figure out what users are doing  create content to make that better  then break that info into bite sized  digestible pieces so your users can make a decision   5  Optimize screen realty  Sticky navigation  ads that take over the screen  excessive marketing jargon  None of this makes your user enjoy the experience more   When your users are scrolling or trying to read  hide your navigation so they have more screen realty to explore your content and place that content strategically so that they don t need to use your nav if they don t want to   Don t ever force an ad on your users that takes over the screen especially when they are in the middle of reading or interacting with content  There s nothing that makes a user want to leave your site more than an ad that takes over their experience and makes them wait 15 seconds until they can get back to what they were doing  Buh bye   If you re going to push ads at your users  make them in stream and based on the context of what your users are looking at   If users are looking at a story about machine learning and the ads in the article are about how they can learn more about machine learning or are otherwise related to the subject  it s not so bad  But when your platform pushes ads completely unrelated to what your user is exploring  like pushing an ad about a product they were previously viewing on Amazon  that s when your experience starts to feel more like an ad platform   Nothing s worse than when you ruin your user s experience  or cause them to bounce  in order to make profits  Soon enough your users will just stop coming  and when they leave so will the revenue you were making off the fact that you had users   6  Use animation meaningfully  Too many apps try to use animation as a band aid for the poor experience they ve created  Remember that animation is there to help explain what is happening  not entertain  You re not making a Disney movie   If I m going through a long process  show me how long I have left  If I open something  let me see it open before my eyes  If I close something  let me watch it minimize or otherwise disappear off my screen  Never drop your user somewhere with no indication of where they ve landed or how whatever just happened  happened  And for the sake of all things often forgotten  please make sure there s a back button   It s okay to use animation for nondescript purposes like Mailchimp does with its post send high five  Twitter does with its micro animations on retweets hearts  or like Facebook does with its new animated reaction emojis  Animation can be a great way to make your experience expressive and human  Just make sure to do it tastefully if you re going to don t have fireworks exploding all over every time your user touches the screen   Animation can be a great complement to your experience if it s used appropriately  Use animation to help your user understand what s happening throughout their experience or to enhance it otherwise  not to entertain   Design to enhance lives  not KPIs  I think the biggest thing I learned about design through my experience is that I d rather create something that people come back to over and over as a tool to enhance their lives than something that makes people waste their lives unconsciously staring at a screen just because it drives revenue   Although we all want to create  sticky  experiences  we should focus on making useful  usable  and compelling experiences that enhance our lives  By focusing on the user s actual needs instead of our business KPIs we ll see more growth than we could ever predict with analytics   I believe that by taking the human into account and not just doing what drives revenue you ll see that you end up making more revenue  It s the inverse of what your analytics driven boss believes  but it s true   So the next time your boss tells you that you need to create a  sticky  experience to drive KPIs  I challenge you to push back  Fight for the person using it  Do the job you re supposed to do   And when your boss gets upset that you re pushing back  be patient  Help him or her understand  Show no fear of rejection  because you re not wrong  Stay calm and explain your thoughts in a way that they can t say no to    Hint  Use research and keep your opinions out of it     The only way we ll ever see change in the big picture of experience design is by taking small steps toward that future every day   Read more from Joe Toscano,"[252 501 623 1318 810 342 435 840 477 127 447]"
282,training-dataset/business/83.txt,business,Browsers  not apps  are the future of mobileA common refrain in discussions over the future of mobile is that  eventually  all mobile apps will be iOS or Android apps    But many of these commentators have a vested interest in helping native mobile apps survive  Proclamations of an all native mobile app world ignore the fact that browsers and the web are fast becoming the mobile operating system of the future  and native apps are slowly dying   Native apps are good for some things but not all things  Native apps are  of course  great at certain things  They re great for frequent  heavy use tasks like communicating with friends  family  and colleagues   something we do multiple times a day  every day  Apps like Snapchat  WhatsApp  and Facebook Messenger need to access cameras  microphones  and the OS directly  So it makes sense for these types of apps to be native iOS and Android apps   But is there really a need for any other type of app to be installed natively  The mobile web  and browsers of today  can easily take care of almost everything we want to accomplish  Let s not forget  native mobile apps were a short term fix for short term connectivity problems  In a 4G  wifi everywhere world  those problems have all but disappeared   For example  companies like Patagonia have already bid farewell to their native mobile app thanks to advances in mobile web capabilities and standards   What was that about websites being irrelevant and this being an app only future  pic twitter com tFrw18KG25   Adam Kmiec   adamkmiec  June 1  2016  We spend more time in mobile web browsers than we think  It s not just companies that are turning away from native apps   the average American now downloads zero apps per month  This has little to do with us spending time on phones   compare this app fatigue with the amount of time we re spending in browsers   Everyone s familiar with Firefox  Chrome  Safari  and Internet Explorer    traditional  browsers with address bars  search functionality  and buttons to skip forwards and backwards  But they re not the only browsers we use every day   We re spending increasing amounts of time inside messaging apps and social networks  themselves wrappers for the mobile web  They re actually browsers  And these browsers give us the social context and connections we crave  something traditional browsers do not   For example  Facebook is our browser for the the social web  It makes it easy for us to browse through and discover the friends  businesses  and content we re most likely to enjoy  Instead of having to  pull  content through traditional browsers  Facebook  pushes  content to us based on our interests and those of our friend networks  We ve also seen a number of aesthetic shifts  with several new features to help Facebook s iOS app approximate a real browser,"[282 647 1181 217 840 926 947 623 1059 450 501]"
285,training-dataset/business/313.txt,business,Building on Slack Saved Our Startup   ThinkGrowth orgFrom the start  we did everything right with Tettra  We validated our assumptions through customer interviews and fake mockups  We got 10 teams to agree to use our product before we ever touched a line of code   Our idea was to build a simple wiki for sharing knowledge on a team  and everyone we talked to seemed really excited to use the product   Then we launched our MVP and no one used it   When we reached back out to those team to figure out what had happened  we found that they all still had a problem sharing internal knowledge  They still believed they could use Tettra solve it  The problem was that no one remembered to use the product   Even after all our research  we missed an important truth about how the world has changed  The way people access a tool is just as important as what the tool does  People are overloaded with information  logins  and interfaces  And here we were  asking them to create a whole new habit   Around the same time we were trying to figure out how to save Tettra  Slack launched their app directory  This felt like the right move   A year later  it s been one of the best strategic decisions we ve made as a new startup  If you re considering this path for your business  here s what you should be taking into consideration   The Perils of Building on a Platform  There s been an explosion of new platforms in the last few years  Facebook Messenger  Slack  Medium  and many others have opened their ecosystems  letting third parties hook into their massive user bases  Jump starting your growth by building on another company s platform is enticing  but not without its risks   Platform can shut down or cut you off  A few years ago Twitter opened its doors and let third party developers build on their platform  New companies sprung up building all sorts of tools on top of Twitter s API  including dozens of alternative clients to Twitter s native web app   Then when Twitter had grown large enough and needed to start monetizing their audience  they locked down their APIs  Many of those companies  including most of the alternative Twitter clients  shut down because they couldn t access the data they needed to make their products work   Another more recent Twitter related example is Meerkat  Meerkat launched a live streaming video app in early 2015 and used Twitter for distribution  It took off like wildfire  growing to millions of users and raising millions of dollars soon after launch  But unknown to them  Twitter was quietly working to acquire a competitor in the live streaming space called Periscope   Twitter eventually disabled Meerkat s access to their social graph and promoted Periscope instead  cutting off Meerkat s primary distribution  The blow proved fatal and  six months later  Meerkat shut down   And Twitter s platform strategy is not an isolated event  More recently  LinkedIn  Netflix and ESPN all locked up their public APIs to approved partners only  shutting off access to open third party developer ecosystems  Unless you can pay  you can no longer play on these platforms   Betting your business on an open API can be risky business   Our risk assessment  We talked about this risk a lot at Tettra  For us  this decision came down to two things   Platform investment  Slack is investing heavily in their platform and even has a dedicated investment fund to support 3rd party developers  Revenue model  Slack s platform is focused on businesses  Its likely monetization strategy is subscription revenue vs  ad revenue  3rd party revenue from external developers lines up with their business model and is good for their bottom line   The platform can clone your entire product  Earlier this year Reddit finally added native image hosting to its service  ending a long standing alliance with Imgur  Now Reddit users have a choice   they can keep using the third party app Imgur or they can use the built in option when posting an image to Reddit   It s yet to be seen what the effects of Reddit offering their own image hosting service will be on Imgur  but it s probably safe to say that the majority of users will choose the path of least resistance and go with Reddit s option   When you hook into a platform  the owner of the platform gets to see all your usage data  Information like how many times your product s been installed or how much money you re making through the platform s billing system is realistically accessible to the platform owner   In other words  if you have a popular app  the platform knows it s popular  In the age of ever growing juggernauts vying for attention and wallets  this is bad news   Our risk assessment  This is a big risk for us  Slack s actually an acronym that stands for Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge  As a knowledge sharing product  you can see why that s worrisome   At SaaStr Annual 2016  Slack s VP of Product  April Underwood  gave some good advice to developers     If the end goal for what you re building is to make Slack using better    then I would recommend trying to think more broadly and to try to solve a broader problem than trying to make the experience on  the  platform a little bit better    We feel like Tettra fits the bill of  thinking broader   Synchronous and asynchronous communication are complementary and should be integrated together  but separate tools  Time will tell what happens as Slack expands their product offering  but for right now Tettra and Slack are symbiotic and work better together   You don t own your destiny  Let s get away from software platforms for a minute and talk about media platforms  What happens if you build an audience on a platform and that platform shuts down  You lose your audience   This happened earlier this year when Twitter shut down Vine  People who had spent years building up a following on Vine lost their entire subscriber base   The same thing can happen if a platform decides to shut down a mission critical endpoint that your company relies on  After raising  49M and growing to 33M users  BranchOut  a service to see where Facebook friends worked and help you find a job  ended up having to shut down  Facebook changed the way its API worked  cutting off developers from accessing data about friends of friends and the way apps could post to people s Facebook walls   Our risk assessment  Our second version of Tettra was built 100  on top of the Slack API   we didn t even have a database when we launched  Doing so allowed us to quickly validate whether people wanted a wiki connected to Slack   And the move was great for us  We went from concept to live product in 2 weeks and received over 200 sign ups within the first 2 days of launching   We also had a plan to move away from this heavy reliance on Slack ASAP  We knew from the start that  if we saw product market fit  we would rebuild the product to house our customer s data in house  For us  the plan to rebuild and store our customers  data made Slack a safe choice   The Perks of Building on a Platform  Now let s talk about the positives  As a geek  Slacks APIs are some of the best I ve ever worked with for a few reasons   You can tell from the consistency of the APIs that the Slack API team put a lot of thought into the design of it all  The entire company is super responsive with support inquiries for developers  They even opened up an endpoint for us last year so we could launch our MVP on time  Most importantly  the user base is super enthusiastic about third party apps and we ve seen great adoption from teams who want Slack to be the backbone of their company   Being connected to Slack is one of Tettra s main selling points and helps new users find us  From there  we re able to sell them on the vision for a simple  internal wiki to share knowledge with the rest of their team and easily explain why Tettra s the best solution for them   But beyond just Slack  there s plenty of good reasons to build on platforms   Access to a massive amount of users  Most of our early sign ups for Tettra came from our Slack App Directory listing  Even a year later  it s still a steady source of traffic to our site and new accounts for us   Distribution channels take a long time to build up and scale  Piggy backing off the customer base that another company has already built is a good way to jumpstart your early growth while you build your own acquisition sources over time   Clear value proposition for prospects  Tettra is an internal wiki for teams that use Slack  In fact  the product only works for teams that use Slack and there s no way to use the service without it   This value proposition limits the upper bounds of our growth to the number of teams using Slack  but it s also crystal clear  we are the wiki for Slack teams  If you re using Slack  you want to use tools that deeply integrate with it and are tailor made for the Slack experience  We re able to deliver a great user experience for a small group of customers  We can always expand our offering beyond Slack if we hit the upper bounds of the market   Another great example of this strategy that I saw recently is Upscribe  a new subscription widget  There are literally hundreds of subscription widgets on the market right now  so you d think there wouldn t be room for another one  That s not the case though  as Upscribe got almost 1 000 votes on Product Hunt and received such an overwhelming response that the load actually crashed their site   So how did they do it  They went niche  Upscribe is the subscription box for Medium  If you write on Medium  there s a clear reason to choose Upscribe over the other options out there  By starting specific  Upscribe has a foundation to build out their user base   Buffer started life as a post scheduling app for Twitter  Once they got traction on Twitter  they expanded their offering to include other services along with additional social media management tools teams  Now they re doing over  12M in revenue each year   TroopsHQ  a Slackbot for Salesforce users  recently raised a  7M Series A round  just a little over a year after founding the company  If you use Salesforce and Slack  you probably will use Troops too   Starting on a single platform gives you a clear value proposition to use in acquiring your first customers   Increase product engagement   retention  The conventional wisdom is that it takes 21 days to build a habit  with some studies finding it might take even three times as long  Habits take a long time to form   Getting people using your product regularly is just as challenging as building a new habit  In Hooked  Nir Eyal outlines a strategy to actually get people using your product regularly through a habit formation loop   By integrating with Slack  Tettra s able to hack that habit formation loop because we show up where our users hang out every day  in Slack   Through Slack s APIs  we can push trigger notifications about recently published Tettra pages right into Slack  There are 2 benefits to this   It s easier for the person publishing a page to spread the word without having to send an email or manually post a link in Slack  Our Slack integration also helps with product engagement because the rest of the team sees the Slack notifications  which subtly reminds everyone else to share their knowledge with their team by creating their own pages   This kicks off the loop again and helps build up a documentation habit inside the entire company  Hooking into another platform and integrating with your user s existing workflows removes steps  making it more likely that people will continually use your product   How to safely build on a platform  If you re still worried about building on a platform  you should check out Josh Elman s talk from the 2015 Weapons of Mass Distribution Conference about How to Build On Other Platform   His four main points for building on platforms successfully are   Get users to come back directly to you  Bring people in through the platform  then figure out a sustainable way to get people coming back to you directly  Remember the value exchange  If you re building on a platform that monetizes through ads  don t build a service that pulls away eyeballs from them  Figure out a way to drive back value to the platform in the form of either users or money  Build features 20 1000 on the roadmap  All companies have limited development resources  but don t build a feature a platform is likely to build into their core product themselves  Focus on features further down the roadmap that the platform is unlikely to get to anytime soon  Platforms are an accelerant  not sustainable fuel  Take advantage of the moment but don t rely on a platform  The rules can change at any time   Platforms are the future of growth  Competition in today s world is fierce  In 2006  the average number of choices a consumer had when choosing a product was four or five  In 2016  that number has spiked to approximately 15 vendors  Creating an amazing product just isn t enough anymore  They key to winning is being the best at distribution and showing up where your users already hang out   People don t want another login to remember or interface to learn  Connecting to existing platforms like Slack makes it easier for your users to access your product and helps you grow  If you re early enough to a platform and build on top of it right  hopefully eventually you ll grow big enough to become a platform yourself   Enjoy this post  Hit the   button below   What do you think  Is building on a platform a good idea or too risky  Share your thoughts

294,training-dataset/product/104.txt,product,Virtual reality and your product development process81 Flares 81 Flares    After years of false starts and incremental improvements  2016 is the year where virtual reality  VR  has finally arrived  Thanks to a combination of advancements in hardware and software  an outpouring of investment  and a massive spike in business and consumer interest  we believe that virtual reality has hit an inflection point that will propel us from the mobile era to the virtual reality  augmented reality era  In this post we discuss which existing processes continue to work with VR as well as the areas where change and innovation is required   Investment and interest in virtual reality  Investment in VR  and augmented reality  is pouring in  According to Digi Capital   1 1 billion in investment occurred in Q1 2016 alone  More recently  it forecasted revenues of  120 billion for AR VR by 2020  At the same time  companies such as Facebook  through Oculus   Google  HTC  and Samsung have already produced and sold hundreds of thousands of VR headsets  A few months down the road  Google Daydream  which we expect to be part of every high end Android phone in a year   Sony Playstation VR  and the mysterious Magic Leap will continue to propel VR into the mainstream   While gaming and entertainment are the first obvious applications of VR  the more interesting applications   and the ones we focus on here   are in B2B and B2C products and services  Brands such as McDonald s  Volvo  Coca Cola  Marriott Hotels  and even President Obama  have successfully released VR content to consumers  with many more scrambling to join them  Airbus  Ford  and IA Interior Architects have all publicly invested in VR for business products   These business applications include everything from education  e commerce  travel  communications  healthcare  job training  and data visualization  to almost anything else you can imagine  For example  the Stanford Human Interaction Lab is exploring the ways VR creates empathy for various social groups  a project that will no doubt replace the HR training of today  NASA is using VR to train astronauts and technicians as well as for planning missions and simulating life on Mars  These types of applications may ultimately account for most VR investment   Building non gaming VR experiences  As we look at what it takes to develop non gaming VR products  their separation from gaming becomes very important  Many video game studios have well established processes for working with 3D and immersive audio experiences   the cornerstones of VR experiences  They are able to start with their existing approach  and make adjustments for VR specific challenges like locomotion and frame rate consistency within the experience  They are not changing their approach so much as working through a new presentation of their existing products   Developing business products in VR  however  is like creating a new sport by combining American Football and what the rest of the world calls Football  They both take place on a field and there are two teams trying to score points with a ball  but outside these similarities it isn t entirely clear where to begin   While VR feels like a natural transition for the gaming world  the fundamental question of why create business products with VR is still being debated  In some cases it provides direct and clear value  VR is an ideal technology for training and simulations  Just consider the history of flight simulators  a multi billion dollar industry in its own right  applied to thousands of industries at a fraction of the cost  On the other hand  what will it mean to use a VR environment as a fundamental communication mechanism  Will we have our email  Slack  and text messages simulacra or find that businesses begin to run on messaging systems native to a virtual environment   For now we are content to acknowledge that in some cases  there is clear business value in applying VR  while in other cases  we have no idea  What is clear  however  is that we are blending two very different worlds  What we consider to be traditional application developers have become exceptionally good at defining products with static wireframes and producing topnotch web and mobile based products  Video game developers have likewise perfected the art of creating massive 3D worlds and telling compelling stories to keep people engaged in those worlds   It s clear we will need help from both sides of the table   The song remains the same  Some things will not change  VR applications grounded in delivering business value operate like web  mobile  and connected device products  They deliver value to a user who is willing to pay either money or attention  In Clayton Christensen speak  the user has hired the product for a job  Novelty might be a job they hire a VR product for  but can we base an industry shift on novelty  Product fundamentals remain if you are building a business around your product  so most of the tools we use to uncover product value are still critical   The underlying approach to managing a project  such as agile  works fine  Communication tools like Slack  still fantastic  But when you move just beyond that  when you look at the content of a user story  when you look at the conversations in Slack  you realise that VR products introduce complexity that is completely foreign to traditional digital application developers   As ever the devil is in the detail  On web and mobile  we can use 2D wireframes to explain most of what a product is going to do and operate in a generally linear and predictable fashion  In VR  partial representations of a dynamic environment that at best provide one perspective of the experience at a moment in time just don t cut it  And don t forget  this product needs to leverage and extend an existing design language and technical architecture  One more thing  audio is really important for immersion   As soon as we move to detailed definition and development of the product things change quickly  We can borrow from both our experiences in traditional products and 3D gaming products  but neither is definitive in terms of navigating a VR product that is focused on delivering value to an end user   So what does all of this mean for product development   The times they are a changin   While the fundamental skills of product development still apply  we re finding that a number of issues which can be ignored in web and mobile development become major considerations in VR  Some of the issues you ll need to consider are   Immersion   The power of VR lies in its ability to fully immerse a user in an environment  A good experience aims to convey emotion and uses timing  space  lighting  sound  and interactions along with more traditional content to create a sense of presence and transport them into the world you create  While directors and game designers may be used to considering all these dimensions  for the rest of us this takes some getting used to   As an example  imagine a submit button  On the web  you only need to define how it looks and works by default  on press  on hover  and when disabled  That same button in VR has the same elements but now you also need to think of how it sounds  how it s lit  how it should interact with different other elements in a scene  and maybe even how it feels if you re dealing with haptics  Additionally  you ll want to support different interaction models so the button may need to be triggered by gazing at it  pointing a laser pointer at it  or simply by walking up and touching it   Adding these dimensions also takes more in the way of expert resources  A single scene might be approached from many different angles  The sound needs to be spatial  The lighting must create an appropriate emotional response  These don t come for free and aren t the responsibility of a traditional user experience expert   At Presence we ve borrowed from the role of a producer in the video game industry to deliver this level of immersion  We have one person who is responsible for the overall experience  They understand the expertise required to deliver the entire product and are more focused on creating cohesion across disciplines than delivering assets  Outside of creating a dedicated role  we have found UX designers and product managers both tend to naturally fill these roles   Performance   VR works best at 90 frames per second  FPS  with 60 FPS on mobile being acceptable for now  It turns out that these frame rates are really hard to achieve in an immersive environment  Messing this up is not an option  It not only leads to a bad experience but it can also mean dizzy  motion sick users  Those users  as a rule  are not going to stick around   You need a technical expert  Not the technical expert that ramped up over the last six months  You need the technical expert that has earned their expertise over years  Similarly on the design side  you will need your design team to have experience in crafting 3D models that not only look good but perform well  Polygon count  effective use of textures  appropriate lighting  and managing particle use is key here   We ve been pairing design and engineering from the traditional web and mobile product development world with experts in the 3D space  most often from the gaming and entertainment industries  This is all about making sure we deliver product value while also taking into account the hard won understanding of what it takes to create powerful VR experiences   Platforms   If you thought the browser wars were bad  wait until you see the VR wars  Not only does each headset have its own APIs and performance differences  but they also come with varying interaction models  capabilities such as room scale and motion tracking  as well as distribution methods  Plus  WebVR will likely mean you ll still have web compatibility issues to deal with   Currently  we see VR broken up into three  classes  of platform  The first class consists of high end rigs like the Oculus Rift  HTC Vive and the soon to be released PlayStation VR  These are expensive  require beefy PCs  or consoles  with cutting edge graphics cards  and are capable of delivering the best overall VR experiences  While they are in the same class  only the Vive currently targets full room scale experiences where the Rift and the PSVR are currently seated only  Additionally  each has its own unique controller and set of inputs   Next we see the mobile platforms such as the GearVR and Google Daydream  While the Gear has enabled people to break into VR for only  100  we expect Android phones that support Daydream to be the first platform to bring VR to the masses  Any Android phone with the right spec will be able to support the inexpensive yet powerful Daydream headset and controller  While users won t get the same experience here as on the PC connected devices  the huge number of devices and Google s backing makes this an exciting space to watch   Finally  we have WebVR  While this will work through any of the headsets mentioned above  the browser will be responsible for most of the heavy lifting  Google  Firefox  and Microsoft Edge have introduced experimental support for VR but the WebVR spec is still some way from being ready for prime time  However  with the open and pervasive nature of the web  there s no doubt that the web will eventually be a major part of virtual reality   Our current approach to platform support is to start with the project goals  For more passive experiences  something like Google Cardboard or GearVR with its limited controls can be ideal due to its larger user base  Meanwhile  meatier interactive experiences or ones that rely on complex interactions are better suited to the Vive or the Oculus Rift   Next  we ll typically select a single platform as our initial target  This allows us to iterate quickly  decrease QA overhead  and focus on making a really polished MVP  Once we ve validated the product  and have the development cycles to spare  we then move into porting the experience to other headsets  This isn t as difficult as it sounds  assuming good programming practices  thanks to most game engines  ability to make builds for any of the VR headsets  At that point  it s mostly a matter of optimizing performance for different device specifications  handling different interactions  and lots of testing   Team Composition   Creating a polished VR experience takes a small army of talents  You need developers skilled in a 3D engine like Unity or Unreal  designers with skill sets ranging from UX and UI  technical artists skilled in 3D modelling  animations  particles  and lighting  and also QA experts who understand how best to test the huge possibility space  You even need sound engineers to create a fully immersive experience   To get the performance and level of detail necessary to produce high quality experiences  all these people need to have spent years understanding the intricacies of 3D development  The trick here is to start with a core team of technical experts and designers and rely on their expertise to bring in other skillsets at the correct time  For instance  you may not need an audio person from day one but you need to have a good enough understanding of your timeline to be able to pull someone in when you need them   Of course  you ll also still need competent back end engineers if you re going to be storing user data or doing anything social or server side  All told  expect team sizes to be at least twice as large as your typical web mobile product   Experimentation   The patterns and best practices for VR are several years from crystallizing and what works well on paper may be a total failure in VR  Many times your developers won t even know what s possible without actually trying it  For now  the only way to be successful is rapid experimentation of concepts and closer interactions between development  design  and customers  That s good news for lean agile adherents but not so good if you re worried about tight deadlines or basing success on a waterfall process   For us the most successful rhythm of experimentation has been the one week prototype sprint  Start with a prioritized list of experiments and then have developers and designers spend one week per experiment  At the end of the week  demo the idea to the larger team  run user feedback studies  revise your experiments  and repeat   The key with these experiments is to explore the key mechanics of the experience you want to build  Don t worry about code quality  ignore good graphics  and attempt to distill the idea into its core essence  Always ask yourself   What s the smallest  simplest version of this idea we can build to test our hypothesis     Once you ve run a number of these experiments  your team will get an idea of what types of experiences actually meet your goals and which fall flat  You re likely to need to do a number of these sprints to truly understand your problem space  but you also need to make sure you don t get carried away   Costs   Producing high quality content can be an expensive endeavour  from team composition alone   Fortunately  there are some techniques you can use to decrease those costs at the expense of some immersion   360  video is the entry point of choice for many companies  It s generally the cheapest to produce and can be immersive if done right  Additionally  with the introduction of stereoscopic cameras  you can add a sense of depth to an experience lacking in regular 360  Unfortunately  this type of content creates a passive user experience and will never be able to create the sense of presence and immersion that a full VR experience can   At the next level  we re seeing interactive 360  videos  They re almost identical to regular 360  content but a layer of interactivity is added on top of the video to create a  choose your own adventure  type of navigational experience or to provide ways to get more information about something happening in the video   Full VR experiences tend to be more expensive to create but also provide the most immersive and interactive experiences  These are the current gold standard of VR and are the reason for its recent success  The cost for this type of development should begin to go down as new technologies and techniques are pioneered  Particularly  photogrammetry and LiDAR based technologies promise a future where photorealistic 3D models can be attained affordably   Creating 360 video experiences  while still intensive  is not as risky as developing a fully immersive experience  As a result  we ve tailored our approach depending on the type of VR experience we have set out to create  As the complexity of the project increases  we increase the amount of experimentation  On paper it looks like this may bloat the cost of a project but in reality it eliminates a huge amount of risk and cuts down on aimless spend  There is nothing as costly as an abandoned project   Wrapping up  The possibilities for VR are nearly infinite but so are the challenges  For many organizations  limited budgets  lack of experienced people  and the need to build such a large and diverse team in order to deliver high quality experiences is a major limiting factor  However  the same was said about early web technologies and look where we are now   As product people  it s our job to be looking over the horizon for what comes next and preparing our offerings and our teams for that new reality  At Presence  we feel strongly that VR is that next big thing and it s up to us to help create ways for our clients to be successful in this new medium   The good news is that building a good product still comes back to the fundamentals that we re all experienced with  The exciting news is that it s going to take a lot of smart people creating a lot of amazing  and mediocre  experiences to pioneer brand new processes and techniques to fit these emerging challenges  We hope you ll join us in creating the future of VR and we d love to hear what you think,"[294 135 472 217 860 623 252 239 1296 647 1233]"
342,training-dataset/product/210.txt,product,The ultimate guide to chatbotsThis guide is a sample of what will be in Joe s upcoming book  The Ultimate Guide to Chatbots  If you enjoy this article and want to supercharge your bot  consider signing up for the book s waitlist   The incredible potential of chatbots lies in the ability to individually and contextually communicate one to many   Let s break that down   One to many communication  There are plenty of tools out there that allow us to communicate one to many at this point in history  These tools  including everything from basic mailers to email marketing to social media  make it easy to reach a large audience and target groups within that audience all at the same  But  for the most part  these tools do not allow us to communicate with people on an individual level   Individual communication  Reaching mass amounts of people at the individual level is something that hasn t been around for very long  The most popular way to do so right now is programmatic advertising but  ultimately  reaching the individual in a meaningful way takes a lot of work and analytic knowhow if you want to do it right   Contextual communication  We do this every day when we talk to someone  It s unconscious behavior for most people   When someone asks you  Should I bring a jacket   you don t ask them what day they were thinking about bringing a jacket you just know that they re asking if they should bring a jacket right now  You unconsciously  or maybe consciously  by checking your weather app  recognize the weather and give your best response based on the conversation you re having and your current environment   I believe contextual communication  a form of dynamic intelligence  is what will make chatbots the revolutionary technology everyone is promising   Right now contextually communicating with bots isn t something that s reasonable to ask across the board  but there are a few that are doing itwell  and I believe this type of interaction will be the standard in the future   While chatbots are still in their infancy in terms of creative potential  it s still a very exciting time for creatives trying to understand the best way to use this new technology and how to build the best bot possible   Why chatbots are disrupting UX  Aside from the reasoning we just walked through  there s also the fact that humans are innately wired to have conversations  It s part of our daily lives  and we rely on our devices to help us communicate every day   It s only natural that we begin to see businesses build where their users are active messaging platforms instead of trying to create and onboard users to new ecosystems they ve created  Not only is it easier and more cost effective  it s also a more natural form of communication   The average person only uses 4 6 apps every day  Although the average smartphone owner has 27 apps on their phone  they typically only use 4 6 of those apps every day  And at the end of 30 days  only 3  of all apps retain their new users    Over 2 5 billion people have at least one messaging app installed  Within a couple of years that will reach 3 6 billion  about half of humanity     The Economist  The effort required to download a new app and test it out to see if it could be the next to join our top 6 just isn t worth the download anymore  Your users would rather have you integrate your services into an app they already use than download another app   What this means  Stop wasting money trying to pull people into your ecosystem  Push your content where your users are already active   Messaging apps have taken over  We ve been selling goods  learning new skills  and building relationships through conversation for millenniums  Messaging apps just happen to be the newest and most interesting way to do it    When we send out broadcast messages to our Kik chatters  usually with links to new videos  we see conversion rates as high as 10      Patrick Starzan  VP of Funny or Die  The top 4 messaging apps have more monthly active users than the top 4 networking apps  They also see longer periods of activity  WhatsApp users average almost 200 minutes of conversation every week   What this means  It s easier to continue a conversation than it is to start a new one  Use messaging apps to build relationships with your audience in a way that feels organic and natural   Signifiers and affordances  Right now  and for the foreseeable future  bots are fairly limited in what you can output to users  This lack of signifiers and affordances is both the challenge and benefit of creating a bot   It s a challenge because you have to figure out how to creatively use these fundamental elements to solve the problem   It s a benefit because it will force you to strip your experience to the most raw  meaningful experience possible   Every interaction should have meaning and provide value   Text elements  The foundation of conversational interfaces is text  Some platforms allow for buttons or quick responses to accompany your textual elements  but this is not globally established at this point in time and  until SMS conforms to the needs of the chatbot economy  it probably won t be global   Media elements  You re currently allowed to use images on every bot platform  including SMS  Accepted formats include JPEG  PNG  and GIF  Some platforms allow you to send videos and audio  but that s about as far as you re going to get and that s only on the bleeding edge of bot platforms   The platforms that allow you to send video include Messenger and Telegram but these more advanced media types have to be sent through a custom code base   Building with template bot platforms like motion ai  Chatfuel  and other similar platforms do not allow video and audio to be sent yet   Bot building best practices  Although chatbots are familiar to most people in the tech industry  they re still a novelty to a majority of the world   I went home to Nebraska in September and when I told everyone what I was working on I got responses like   You mean like those things that you could talk to on AOL when you were bored    I laughed  but this is a reality  There are a lot of people that will have no idea what you re talking about so it s important that you keep that in mind as you build   Here are 9 best practices that will help you make your bot user friendly   1  Don t lie to your users  People aren t dumb  If you over promise or tell them your bot is something that it s not  they ll figure it out eventually   For now  bots should handle logic and things that robots would be good at  They should not take over the role of a human being   Obviously you want your bot to feel as human as possible  but if you try to convince your users it s not a bot and they get suspicious  they ll probably leave  Earning their trust back will be more difficult than just telling them up front that they re working with a bot   People are more comfortable and forgiving if you let them know they re talking to a machine with limitations   What you should do  Let users know up front they re talking to a machine Let your users know the capabilities and limitations of your bot so they don t try to use your bot for anything and everything Admit when things get messed up because of your bot s capabilities  2  Onboard with conversation  Although AI bots like Siri  Alexa  and Google have been around for a while now  most people aren t familiar with speaking or texting with an inanimate object to get what they want  We re still used to navigating WYSIWYG interfaces to get what we need   It s your job  as the bot designer  to tactfully teach your users how easy a conversational interface can be   What you should do  When available  use buttons to ease your users into the experience with something familiar   Some platforms like SMS don t let you create buttons yet  so use actionable commands instead   After a few button clicks  make your users type a response to move forward in their experience to get them comfortable with typing  Do this by giving your users an actionable command  Make all buttons and commands actionable  3  Design for human emotion  Talking to a robot is boring  While it may be efficient and meet the objective of the product  it won t be something people enjoy coming back to  And it s not something we re used to   If you don t give your bot a personality  users will so plan for that by projecting the personality you desire  This is something you should already be doing as a brand  but it s even more important now   Designing for human emotion is just as  if not more  important with chatbots as it is with any other experience  The emotion is the bot  and the bot is the experience   What you should do  Use friendly  inclusive language when speaking to your users to make them feel like they re chatting with a friend or someone familiar Repeat inputs back to users to check for understanding  This will make your users feel comfortable and help you gain their trust When users start to play games with your bot  i e  asking the same question over and over to test it   don t be afraid to be sassy and show users that your bot is listening  4  Conversation is limitless  Language is one of the most powerful tools on this planet  In college  I minored in English language has always fascinated me  But building a chatbot that has AI behind it was one of the hardest things I ve ever done   Speaking the way we form our sentences and the words we choose becomes an unconscious behavior at a certain point in life  However  to build a bot with AI I had to deconstruct my unconscious model of language in order to teach a computer what I know   You ll drive yourself crazy thinking about the variety of ways someone  or some thing  could be addressed  what syntax structure is most representative of the way your users talk  what words are most likely to be misspelled and how they could be misspelled   Most children in the United States go through 12 years of English classes to learn the language  and they re still usually not that great at it   Computers may learn faster but it still takes time  and there s not much you can do to accelerate the process besides pushing loads of data at it   What you should do  Front load your user base with people that like breaking things to test your system  Onboarding the right people up front is crucial  Use an SEO typo generator to plan for common misspellings and errors Accept that building your AI is going to take time and that initially it s not going to work well  The only way it gets better is when it breaks  Plan for this and create boundaries to limit breaks   5  Create boundaries  We re used to websites  apps  and digital devices that have a limit to the width of the screen  the length of the page  the number of buttons we can press  and so on  We are comfortable with these limitations and guiding elements   Conversations are limitless if you let them be   To keep people engaged we need to create limits and pathways for users so it feels familiar  Users won t tell you because they don t know it yet  but they ll appreciate it   What you should do  Prompt users with actionable statements and buttons to guide the conversation Use buttons to make it feel more like interactions users are used to from their experiences in websites and apps Create content blocks to catch mistakes and reroute the conversation back to a safe place Teach your bot foundational conversation interactions and build triggers to resolve these common threads  6  Let them down easy  Unless your bot is completely templated and only experienced through button clicks  your bot is going to break at some point or another  There s no way around it   Conversations are limitless and you probably won t have connections to everything your users are going to want for months or years after building your bot  Even then your bot will still struggle at times   Plan for this by making the broken experience as painless as possible   What you should do  Show that you understand their pain Offer options on how to handle the situation and reroute users to safe areas within your system Offer human intervention Do NOT leave users with empty white space without reason  7  Every interaction is meaningful  There s no need for analytics software to be hooked on when every click or input means something  The task of understanding users behavior becomes less difficult  but maintaining focus may become more difficult   It s important to realize that not everything your users want is part of your product and maintain focus through all the noise   What you should do  Properly label all your content blocks so they re easy to interpret Track down the content blocks inputs that you re seeing the most users leave from  figure out why  then change them  8  Help users help you  You can t possibly anticipate everything your users will want at this point in time  A conversation is limitless   Instead of trying to infer user needs or asking them to fill out a survey  build hooks that allow users to give you feedback directly through the bot during an interaction that feels natural   What you should do  Let users submit articles when they ask for something your bot doesn t know about Ask users if the results your bot gave them are what they were looking for  and if they re not  let them tell you what they want  9  Identify and target user sentiments  A conversation is filled with so much more emotion than an interface  Instead of asking your users for feedback  they ll give it to you whether they realize they re doing it or not   Use your knowledge of user s sentiments to trigger content blocks to extend and improve the experience at the most appropriate time   What you should do  Take advantage of positive sentiment to promote your product or get users to do some promoting for you Identify negative sentiment and do what you can to save face  It s time to create the future  Bots are a powerful tool when they re created properly  And they re only going to get more and more powerful as time goes on   Take advantage of being ahead of the curve and start building your own today   If you d like to chat about anything related to this article

346,training-dataset/business/749.txt,business,Ten questions to answer while managing a platform  network or marketplaceManaging platforms involve much more than just getting the orchestration of supply and demand right  It involves much more than just getting to critical mass  There s a whole range of issues that managers of successful platforms must constantly think about   Last year  I wrote a book  Platform Scale  which focused on the first part  How to build a business model that can orchestrate supply and demand and get to network effects  Much of my blog has also focused on answering some of those questions   However  over the past two years  I ve focused my research and advisory on a much broader and more comprehensive range of platform management issues  which I will increasingly start writing more about in the coming days  This article is a first step towards laying out a set of these issues that platform builders should constantly seek to address   My next book   Platform Revolution   lays out a comprehensive analysis of all these issues involved in running and managing platforms  Co authored with my research partners Marshall Van Alstyne and Geoff Parker at MIT  it lays out a detailed framework for understanding all factors involved in platform strategy   I ve written this article to share a summary of much of our work in this field  packaged as a checklist for startups as well as incumbents building platforms  These are issues explored in detail in  Platform Revolution   and the checklist below is composed of 10 questions that you should constantly seek to answer while building platforms and marketplaces   1  Building network effects   What factors create network effects on the platform   This is  by far  the most important question that platform builders should look to answer  The answers are much more nuanced than they appear to be  Platform growth is much more about the careful design of value proposition and structuring feedback loops than it is about growth hacking   Another key issue is the management of negative network effects  where users coming on board may reduce value for certain other users on the platform  Identifying and mitigating causes of negative network effects should be an equally important part of any platform s growth strategy   2  Openness  access  and immigration  Who should get access and who should not  Platforms work like countries   they need an immigration policy  More users aren t necessarily always good  As mentioned above  some users can kickstart negative network effects  The platform needs to ensure that it has clear policies on who can come in and what they can do  This should also be baked into the architecture  and the algorithms  of the platform   3  Governance issues  How do you govern user behavior and ensure fair distribution of incentives to all parties   Stretching the platform as country metaphor further  platforms need to be governed  They need to be governed much like countries and this is where extremely tech focused entrepreneurs may underestimate the importance of community management and education  Airbnb and Uber  for example  have vastly different approaches to community management  One nurtures the producers  the other treats them as substitutable commodities   Governance extends beyond community management and even moves into the realms of behavior design where certain platforms may actively manipulate user behavior to maximize network effects  Such design decisions need to be taken carefully to balance individual outcomes with network ouctome   Much of platform governance will benefit from the many improvements in machine learning that have been achieved over the last 3 years  The best governed platforms are the ones that learn fastest from their data  The more a platform learns about its ecosystem  the more resilient it becomes   4  Policy and regulation  What regulatory aspects must you factor in while governing distributed producer bases and their data   Policy and regulation can be tricky with platform business models  Labor and production paradigms are different  The lines between employee and ecosystem producer are often blurred  On demand platforms are facing the heat of such regulatory issues currently  Creation of new producers can impact adjacent markets the way Airbnb has impacted the regular rental market in many US cities  Platforms also introduce new taxation issues when they start centralizing commerce and taking commerce away from local players  Finally  governing data businesses involves its own set of complications  Data residency is a contentious issue  Companies in the US arguably know more about people in India than the Indian government because of the data that several US based platforms have about users   5  Managing enemies  How can you compete and emerge the winner   Like all firms  platforms also face competition  But here s the interesting thing  Just like growth  competition also works exponentially on platforms  When a competitor takes users away from a platform  the platform s ability to compete decreases because those users were creating value on the platform  Hence  the platform becomes even more susceptible to future competition  As a result  market leading platforms may fall rapidly if a competitor starts siphoning users away  Competitive strategy should always focus on the preservation of your own network effects and on attacking the factors that lead to network effects for competitors   6  Managing friends  When can your ecosystem be a threat and how do you monitor for such occurrences   The uniqueness of the platform business model brings with itself the added challenge of managing friends  partners in your ecosystem who may be helping your cause today but may turn against you tomorrow  Samsung helps Google but remains an ongoing threat and did try to fork Android and create its own little ecosystem   Managing friends   partners in your ecosystem   can often be more challenging than managing enemies  Managing friends follows from good governance and should ensure that the platform constantly monitors activity in its ecosystem  The more the platform learns about how its ecosystem behaves  from activity data   the more resilient it becomes   7  Monetization  Most importantly  how do you monetize in a manner that strengthens network effects   Platform monetization is probably the most mind bending of the changes that come with the shift from pipes to platforms  Monetizing pipes was simple and straightforward   How much should we charge     was the key question on pipes  Platforms need to struggle with the  how much     who   and  for what   questions  Knowing who to charge and for what value must be determined based on whether these choices strengthen or weaken network effects  Very few platforms  with extremely strong network effects    Facebook  for example   can afford to employ monetization strategies that have a negative impact on network effects    Platform Revolution  takes a long hard look at the various nuances involved in answering all these questions  and lays out a comprehensive management framework for all platforms   new or mature  run by startups or incumbents   Additionally  there are three higher level questions that are equally important for every platform builder to consider  that are explored in detail in  Platform Revolution    8  Platforms  Good idea or bad idea   When is a platform business model a good idea  More importantly  is there a way to predict when it might be a bad idea   Not all platform ideas are good  Many platforms may fail at execution  but some platforms are a bad idea to start with  Much of it goes down to insufficient incentives for users to participate  Platforms that seek to internalize an interaction which is already more efficient externally are bound to fail unless they can identify new ways to make the interaction more efficient   9  Startups vs  incumbents  Are there industries where startups have a natural advantage with the platform business model  Are there other industries where the incumbents will have a natural advantage   Are there industries where startups are better positioned to win and others where incumbents may have an advantage  Mining  for example  is an industry where incumbents are rapidly transforming themselves before startups can wrest advantage away  Likewise  an equally important consideration is to evaluate opportunities for startup platforms to collaborate with incumbent pipes in an industry where new platforms are changing dynamics rapidly   10  What s next   Which industries are ripe for platforms to come in and change the rules of the game   Question 9 leads us to the final question  When platforms transform an industry  timing plays an important role  Zipcar was launched many years before Uber but failed to have a significant impact on transportation  Understanding the factors that govern timing helps platform builders determine when they should launch    Platform Revolution  covers a lot of ground on the issues laid out above  It s all set to launch on March 28th

352,training-dataset/business/155.txt,business,A Hierarchy of Social Drivers   Christian Limon   MediumVanity is Good  A Hierarchy of Social Drivers  Vanity   Social Networks    Vanity  noun   to care about the perception of one s self  An effort to promote one s self or have pride in one s achievements or appearance     We don t talk about vanity within product strategy  but I ll argue that it s fundamental to the success of social networks  How fundamental   Vanity is the single most powerful driver for building a consumer social network  Dominant social platforms become so because they leverage human vanity within core product loops   Social 1 0 introduced us to vanity distribution  posting updates about our personal lives  loved ones  and achievements  One click vanity features reinforced these posts with likes  views  follows  retweets  and comments   making for a positive community experience   Hierarchy of Social Drivers  All social networks are not created equal  neither are the underlying motivators that propel them  There s a hierarchy for what drives and grows a powerful human network  The higher you are within the hierarchy  the stronger the glue bonding the network   The drivers are   1  utility   tools   2  content   media   3  community  and  4  vanity   Networks based on lower level motivators  such as  utility   can more easily become commoditized and displaced  The further up the scale you go  the more difficult the underlying network is to replicate  the platform s strength become an intangible  feeling   not a clonable feature   Platforms that feed a person s vanity  within communities they care about  become irreplaceable within the lives of their users   Vanity as a Product Strategy  What s different about our current position within social network history   Young folks still care about utilities  content media  and community  which traditionally initiated social networks in Social 1 0  The key distinction now is that young people only care about these things insomuch as it helps them to promote themselves  The greater the resulting sense of local celebrity  the greater their affection for the platform   Basic media  video photo distribution  tools   in and of themselves  no longer make for interesting standalone products  Media sharing utility has been commoditized and eaten up by Facebook  YouTube  and Twitter   Takeaway  When building product loops  ask  does this improve on and increase an average person s sense of personal celebrity     Case 1  Rise of The Lip Syncing Music Video App  Sharing music and video clips was a Social 1 0 driver  Dub and music video lip syncing apps have simply layered on the power of vanity to surface new demand   Now the music video clip becomes about the users  more so than the song  as if to say   this song is cool  but look at ME  I m the star    Young people are motivated to share media insomuch as it helps them to promote themselves  Enhancing local celebrity is the backbone of Flipagram and Musical ly  who clearly lead the category     Case 2  Vanity as Distributor of Ideas  Vanity is not just for kids  it s even embedded in the intellectual corners of social media  e g   Twitter   If Twitter s intellectual content unit is the  the idea   yours or someone else s via tweet or retweet   vanity is the motivating distribution mechanism  The champion of the idea seeks affirmation  promoters of the idea seek association     Case 3  Good through Vanity  A mechanism of vanity loops can be fun toys or it can be focused on specific communities for a targeted social impact  PumpUp uses vanity to reinforce a health   wellness support community  the results of which are quite inspiring   The White Space    Facebook  The Sleeping Giant  There s a struggle within Facebook that s opened the door for vanity driven apps  Users on Facebook are posting less and less about themselves and their personal lives  Vanity has plummeted   Sharing of personal stories  rather than public info posts  e g   news articles  dropped 21  year over year  as of mid 2015   Facebook is maturing into a media distribution   content platform propelled by its success as a revenue machine  The compromise comes at the expense of personal vanity and connections   Prioritizing vanity posts  over media  would dilute Facebook s total available advertising impressions  Personal posts produce significantly fewer ad impressions   This year s F8 hardly touched on personal relationships  F8 announcements focused on pro video  native publishers  businesses  and bots     Snapchat  The Benefactor  Snapchat is not only eating Facebook s personal content  it s increasing people s comfort   frequency with sharing vanity  thereby creating an even larger opportunity for itself   Not long ago  recording videos throughout the day of yourself  alone  talking to your phone  as if hosting a live show   would ve been absurd behavior  Not today  Thanks to Snapchat  previously dark corners of vanity have illuminated and our personal connections might be better for it   Takeaway  gain from Facebook s compromises  Study who and what incumbents neglects   Evolving Social Zeitgeist   Opportunity  Rising social platforms figure out how to leverage vanity in creative new ways  exploiting trends in popular culture and social norms   The line defining  socially acceptable  vanity is dynamic  historically evolving in favor of increased liberal acceptance and adoption   It s fun to look at how the line of acceptable vanity has changed over the past 15 years on social   The graph below is an example of newly acceptable vanity posts and the championing social platform   Takeaway  Changes in platforms   societal norms create opportunities for entrepreneurs   Key Takeaways,"[352 1074 1023 346 1375 1256 780 239 765 1004 885]"
402,training-dataset/business/224.txt,business,6 Reasons Platforms FailThe success of platform businesses like Alibaba  Airbnb  and Uber is so remarkable that discussion about them often misses just how hard they are to build  For every successful platform  there are many more that struggle or simply don t make it  Apple and Google  two of the world s most valuable companies  have had their share of platform failures as we ll show  Studying these successes and failures  we ve identified half a dozen key reasons platforms fail  all of which boil down to managers  misunderstanding of how platforms operate and compete   Platform businesses bring together producers and users in efficient exchanges of value   Uber  for example  connects drivers and passengers just as YouTube connects videographers and viewers  And  they leverage network effects   the more participants on the platform  the greater the value produced  Managerial mistakes that inhibit value exchange or network effects can kill a platform  Let s look at the key errors   1 Failure to optimize  openness   Because platforms depend on the value created by participants  it s critical to carefully manage the platform s  openness    the degree of access that consumers  producers  and others have to a platform  and what they re allowed to do there  If platforms are too closed  keeping potentially desirable participants out  network effects stall  if they re too open there can be other value destroying effects  such as poor quality contributions or misbehavior of some participants that causes others to defect   Insight Center The Platform Economy Sponsored by Accenture How online marketplaces are changing the face of business   Steve Jobs failed miserably at managing openness at Apple in the 1980s  He charged developers for toolkits   inhibiting the very software producers he should have wanted on Apple s platform  The result was that Apple struggled to create a robust platform connecting Apple customers and software producers  For years Apple s market penetration hung in the single digits  Apple has since figured out this balance  of course  by opening the iOS platforms to app developers  By contrast  Bill Gates opened Windows to both software and hardware developers  making Windows the dominant desktop platform by virtue of its superior ability to connect software and hardware producers with consumers   Yet platforms can become too open  They must retain enough control over core assets to maintain control of the ecosystem and to make money  Google learned this lesson when Amazon and Samsung fragmented   forked  in tech lingo  the open Android platform to create their own open source versions  Google Android quickly lost market share to the new versions  Reacting quickly  Google regained control of the Android system by restricting access to difficult to replicate services such as mapping and by shifting important application programming interfaces  APIs  to the proprietary Google Play Store  Android s story demonstrates that platform openness is one of the key managerial decisions that can determine platform success or failure   2  Failure to engage developers  Opening platforms the right amount is necessary but not sufficient  The platform owner must also show software developers what s in it for them if they contribute  In 2013  Johnson Controls invited developers to help them build Panoptix  an energy efficiency platform for buildings and office space  But by early 2015 they stopped accepting new submissions to their open market and discontinued their API support for external developers  Panoptix had not attracted enough new apps to justify pouring resources into supporting this limited external development   It s not enough to open the door and set the table  Successful platforms engage in platform evangelism  providing developers with resources to innovate  feedback on design and performance  and rewards for participation  Think of it this way  To host a successful event you must plan carefully  invite the right people  have the right food  and manage competition with the party next door  If Android throws a Hawaiian luau with a five course feast  free travel  and attendees get to meet Robert Downey Jr  and Sandra Bullock the same night that Johnson Controls offers crackers in Cleveland and asks attendees to cover their own costs  which party will developers attend   3  Failure to share the surplus  Having valuable interactions is the reason to participate on a platform  The consumer  the producer  and the platform all win if the division of value works for everyone  But if one party gets insufficient value  then they have no reason to participate  Back in 2000  several automakers including Daimler Chrysler  Ford  GM  Nissan and others invested in Covisint  an online marketplace intended to match buyers and suppliers of auto parts  Unfortunately  Covisint s ownership structure and auction format heavily favored auto companies  the consumers on the platform  while forcing suppliers into fierce price competition  leaving them with little or no residual value  As a result  parts suppliers left the platform and the market never became sustainably profitable  In 2004  the residual assets were sold off for a mere  7 million  a tiny fraction of the  500 million auto manufacturers had invested   A simple rule for platform managers is to take less value than you make  and share value fairly with all participants   4  Failure to launch the right side  Platform managers have to carefully determine which side of the platform market to emphasize  and when  Sometimes at launch it s important to focus on attracting consumers over producers  sometimes it s the reverse  and sometime both sides need equal attention from the outset   Despite huge fanfare and an experienced platform leader  Google Health failed  Google Health was intended to be the premier place for consumers to consolidate their health information  Google tried its preferred strategy of focusing first on the consumer side of the market  an approach that worked beautifully for search  email  and maps  But this time  Google needed to focus first on providers   the other side of the market  Consumers might have used the service if the doctors and insurers who held their information were willing to engage  But they didn t welcome the scrutiny or the loss of control over data they already possessed  Securing their participation will be critical if health information platforms are to succeed   5  Failure to put critical mass ahead of money  Do you remember Billpoint  It was the digital payment system eBay pushed before it gave up and acquired PayPal  As the insider on an established platform  Billpoint should have won  But where Billpoint emphasized fraud prevention  PayPal emphasized ease of use  While Billpoint charged higher transaction fees  PayPal gave away  5 and  10 payments to users who signed up other users  Fraud prevention can keep platform costs down over the long term but puts friction on user transactions  which dissuades value creating activity  PayPal ate the costs of fraud and emphasized rapid growth by simplifying transactions and incenting participants to attract others  As a result  PayPal rapidly surpassed Billpoint as the payment system of choice on eBay  Conceding defeat in 2002  eBay bought PayPal for  1 4 billion and phased out Billpoint a year later  Billpoint made the mistake of emphasizing revenue generation at the start rather than  first  attracting a critical mass of participants   Even after the subsidies end  platform monetization that comes at the expense of building network effects is rarely sustainable in the long run as it works against the core mechanism by which platforms create value at scale   6  Failure of imagination  Perhaps the most egregious platform failure is to simply not see the platform play at all  It is also one of the hardest for traditional firms to avoid  Firms guilty of this oversight never get past the idea that they sell products when they could be building ecosystems  Sony  Hewlett Packard  HP   and Garmin all made the mistake of emphasizing products over platforms  Before the iPhone launched in 2007  HP dominated the handheld calculator space for science and finance  Yet today  consumers can purchase near perfect calculator apps on iTunes or on Google Play and at a fraction of the cost of a physical calculator  Apple and Google did not create these emulators  they merely enabled them by providing the platform that connects app producers and consumers who need calculators   Sony has sold some of the best electronic products ever made  It once dominated the personal portable music space with the Walkman  It had the world s first and best compact disc players  By 2011  its PlayStation had become the best selling game console of all time  Yet  for all its technological prowess Sony focused too much on products and not enough on creating platforms   What became of Sony s players  A platform   iOS   ate them for lunch   Garmin  as a tailored mapping device  suffered a similar fate  As of 2012  Garmin had sold 100 million units after 23 years in the market  By contrast  iPhone sold 700 million units after just eight years in the market  More people get directions from an iPhone than from a Garmin  not only because of Apple maps but also because of Google Maps and Waze  As platforms  iOS and Android have ecosystems of producers  consumers  and others that have helped them triumph over such products as the Cisco Flip camera  the Sony PSP  the Flickr photo service  the Olympus voice recorder  the Microsoft Zune  the Magnus flashlight  and the Fitbit fitness tracker   When a platform enters the market  product managers who focus on features are not just measuring the wrong things  they re thinking the wrong thoughts   For an in depth look at platform strategy  see the authors  HBR article  Pipelines  Platforms  and the New Rules of Strategy  in the April 2016 issue,"[402 874 346 764 1367 1296 1170 285 55 913 412]"
411,training-dataset/product/1465.txt,product,A framework for designing a better user onboarding experienceAfter weeks of brainstorming  sketching  designing  and arduous development  your app s ready to launch  Your team s enthusiasm is through the roof   This is the moment of truth  Will the app be successful   User onboarding has so much to do with an app s success really  it can make or break it  Done right  it ll result in people coming back to use the app again and again   Great user onboarding feels effortless  demonstrates value  and bridges the gap between users  expectations and what the product can help them achieve   Related  5 key lessons for successful user onboarding  Distilling the experiences we ve had building apps here at tapptitude  we ve come up with a straightforward framework called instruction action to better understand and design effective user onboarding flows for mobile products   The instruction action framework is based on strategically playing with the 2 building blocks of the user onboarding process   Instruction elements Action elements  Instruction elements  Instruction elements are your best friends  Be it annotations  modals  or any other bits of copy  use instruction elements to efficiently communicate to the user how to use the app so they can discover its core value   Some of the most popular instruction elements   Splash screen  Welcome screens  with benefits or features   Annotations  Permissions  Explanatory modals  People won t come back to use your app a second time if they don t immediately understand how to get the most out of it   Action elements  Nir Eyal s Hook model says the actions someone takes in a product are triggered by carefully designed persuasion elements  Ideally  such elements are a combination of motivational and instructional content so that the user has the reasons to perform a task and also knows how to do so   When it comes to action elements  think of strategic design elements  clear calls to action and suitable visuals that act as a trigger for the user  The smallest arrow can have a big impact  Signal to the user that they re on the right track  Instead of guessing whether they should click or swipe  the user will feel encouraged to take action   Examples of action elements   Sign in  Sign up  Allow access  Actionable tool tip  In any given user onboarding process  instruction elements and action elements work together to lead the user where they can experience the product s value  How you combine these 2 types of elements depends on the purpose of the screens and the overall logic of the onboarding process   Some typical examples of purposes app screens could have   Browse through the primary features of the app  Present best practices within the app  Collect basic user account information in order to set up the app  tailored to the person using it  Explain a feature while allowing the user to experience it at the same time  useful and fun  Upsell your app s capabilities  show people the app s capabilities and offer a glimpse of what more it could do with just a little financial support on their behalf  Now it s time to assess how to work with instruction and action elements   Sometimes people don t discover an app s core value the first time they use it  So it s the responsibility of the user onboarding process to get that person back on track and into the conversion flow   Based on this premise  we realized that we ve got 2 major areas where onboarding happens  outside product and inside product   Outside product onboarding  What are the chances of someone downloading and using your app without gathering the least bit of information about the product and believing in its promise   Close to zero   User onboarding ends with the user experiencing their  aha  moment  But it all starts with their first encounter with the product  or what we like to call outside product onboarding  And that usually happens long before using the product itself on social media  the product s website  or in the App Store  During these first encounters  the user establishes their expectations about the product and jumps inside the first phase of your conversion flow   And this is just step 1 of outside product user onboarding   Say you ve convinced someone to download your app  and then they open the app for the very first time  What will this experience entail   This is where step 2 of outside product user onboarding takes place   You could use a few instruction elements  nice visuals and bits of copy  and action elements to get the user inside the app  Show the user the most compelling benefits of your app in a few nicely designed screens  and encourage them every step of the way to try it out for themselves   Related  Copywriting principles that will make new users love you  Another approach  Make it clear to users that sharing information about themselves will be rewarded in the long run  Use instruction elements to make your intentions clear  and action elements to point the user in the right direction   If you ve managed to spike the user s interest and motivate them to give the app a chance  you can move on to the second major area of mobile user onboarding   Inside product onboarding  Once the user is inside the app  they ll expect to find everything they ve been promised in the previous onboarding phase  You don t want them to get lost  wondering what to do next  So you have to show them where to go   The focus of the onboarding process should be to guide the user towards the core value proposition of the app  Help them discover how the app can bring an improvement to the way they ve been doing things up until now  or how much fun the app is  Once this is done  the user will be a lot more open to discover the rest of the app s features  one at a time   Let s take a look at a few examples of how you could guide the user through the core use case of your app   For a social app  people will expect to be able to contact a friend as soon as possible in order to decide if this product brings anything new to the table  Is the core feature of the product the ability to chat with friends and family  or is the user s profile equally important  Show the users how to set up a profile with a minimum amount of information  how to add friends  offer the option to import contacts   and enable them to chat freely  Then cross your fingers   For a calendar app  it s all about how well the product organizes the user s schedule  Allow the user to either import or sync existing calendars and events from other platforms  if they want  Quickly enable the user to get the feel of the product  What s the design of this calendar  Is the schedule easy to analyze  What kind of customization is available for the different types of events   For a photo editing app  show the user how effortless the entire process is  Enable them to either pick an image from the camera roll or take a picture on the spot  guide them through the editing process using annotations where necessary  and finally present them with the sharing options  For people working with picture editing apps  a fluent editing journey is as important as the quality of the product   A good mobile product deserves a solid user onboarding strategy  Don t limit yourself to the product itself  Start planning by

412,training-dataset/business/573.txt,business,Platform Strategy   by Sangeet Paul ChoudaryUnderstanding competitive strategy has long been an obsession of CEOs and business leaders  A lot of the drive for understanding the nature of competition stems from the assumption that business is a zero sum game  Till very recently  that seemed true  Today  it doesn t   Michael Porter s work on competitive strategy  not least the five forces model  has long served as some form of cornerstone for business strategy  The idea was that business success relied on the creation of moats and management of these five forces  The goal of business  in the Porterian sense  was to beat the competition   But over the last fifteen years  we ve seen a significant shift in how we think about competitive strategy  This started first with Blue Ocean Strategy dispelling the idea that zero sum competition was all that one must obsess over  In parallel  Christensen s work on disruptive innovation gained further ground as firms realised that your future competitor may look nothing like your current competitors   Several things changed over the last couple of decades  First  the internet and global connectivity ensured that expansion of markets was no longer as onerous as it used to be  Second  with the rapid pace of innovation over the last two decades  innovation has rapidly become much more important than winning zero sum competitive games   But most importantly  the internet allows entirely new markets to be created that didn t exist in the past  Two aspects of this were explored by Chris Andersen when he looked at how the internet leads to the creation of long tail demand  and supply  leading to market interactions that would never have existed in the past  Book  The Long Tail  and how the internet allowed the creation of markets where products and services could be exchanged for free  Book  Free    How platforms change competition  While both long tail interactions and free interactions have changed how we think about strategy  the most transformative shift to impact competition yet may only just be starting out  This is the ability to create entirely new markets and bring order to existing disordered markets  This is what platforms do   The notion of competition changes dramatically with platforms   First  traditional competition was built on exclusive access to supply side resources e g  an oil field  Platform competition  instead  is built on exclusive access to the ecosystem around the platform and the data about their interactions  The platforms with the most active ecosystems and the ability to mine their interaction data win   Second  while traditional competition played zero sum games  platforms focus on growing the pie with others in their industry participating on them  Collaboration co exists with competition  Today  Ford doesn t simply have to worry about competing with Apple or Google  it has to also figure out how to participate in Apple s ecosystem in some way so as not to be left behind like Nokia and Blackberry  Strategic considerations on recognising competition and their key source of competitive advantage aren t straightforward anymore  We ve seen this with how Android has had to repeatedly stave off competition from members of its own ecosystem  like Samsung and Amazon   I m writing about competition because my research partners   Marshall Van Alstyne and Geoffrey Parker   and I have been digging into this a lot of late and have worked on advising several industry leaders on the competitive movements that they see in their industry  We ve put together a lot of our observations in our forthcoming book Platform Revolution  We ve also written an article in the April issue of the Harvard Business Review discussing the intricacies of competition in a world of platforms   The deck below showcases some of our work in this area in a fast pacy read  If you d like to get a deeper view  you should get a copy of Platform Revolution and watch out for the next issues of the HBR as well  But for now  have a look at the deck below to whet your appetite on this topic   TWEETABLE TAKEAWAYS  The future of competition Share this  Why platform competition is fundamentally different from pipeline competition Share this  When competitive advantage moves from resource ownership to ecosystem orchestration Share this,"[412 346 764 1170 874 402 1296 480 55 162 1242]"
435,training-dataset/business/969.txt,business,7 Steps to Getting Started with  100Here at the Founder Institute  we know what it s like to market a startup on budget  The following is a guest post from Travis Levell  Founder of Project Pivotal where he goes over an effective strategy that will make it seem like you ve got  5K to invest in marketing  Enjoy   Every day thousands of aspiring entrepreneurs have new startup ideas  They spend their time researching their industry and trying to pull resources together to bring their idea into reality   Few entrepreneurs make it to the point where they are actually ready to begin marketing their idea  For those who do make it this far  it is a totally different battle than the one you ve been fighting up until now  It s finally time to start sharing your idea with the whole world   and that s scary   I know your pain  I ve been there before  And it sucks  That s why I ve devoted my time to discovering and creating startup marketing strategies  This is 1 of my 3 favorite strategies that I m sharing with you today  It will allow you to take a  100 budget  and stretch it to be as effective as if you d had  5K or more    100 Doesn t Get You Much These Days  Does it   For most marketing strategies these days  100 won t get you far  Especially in a competitive market   In fact  if you want to have a successful ad campaign  you often need to have  500 to throw away to see what kind of audiences respond to what kind of ads   I discovered this recently when I hired a Facebook ads coach to help me get better results  You ve got to do a lot of testing upfront in order to find successful ads  This can get really expensive  really fast    100 won t get you far in this instance  4 leads  maybe   Approaching this issue traditionally with a limited budget won t do you any good  You need to get a smarter strategy if you want to get ahead faster   Luckily  I ve done lots of research and testing on this issue  and I m sharing my smarter strategy with you   If you want to be successful at this  you need to understand a couple of concepts  The first one is understanding the importance of making your product go viral to amplify all of your marketing efforts   Forcing Virality  The Way to Make Your Dollars Stretch  No matter what your product is  going viral will help you grow faster  For some products  like apps  it will be a little easier  You have plenty of options to build in functionality that will make it easy and rewarding for your users to share your product   For example  I ll admit I ve been playing lots of Angry Birds lately  don t ask me why   In the game  they have bonuses that you can collect  but the only way you can unlock them is by sharing them with a friend  Now that s some smart viral thinking  A reward for both parties involved  and an easy way for the user to participate   This viral reward structure can be implemented into almost any app  By sharing  you can give the user more unlocked functionality  a discount on an in app purchase  access to a secret page  or whatever other reward you can think up   But for other non app products  like B2B companies or hardware companies  you might have to do a little more strategizing  One of my favorite techniques in this instance is to conduct a viral giveaway  In this case study by Michael Karp  he shows how one company managed to gain 3200 subscribers in just one week by conducting a viral giveaway   That s 3200 targeted people that are highly interested in your product in just one week  Now that s some quick traction   No matter what you decide to do  having some type of viral campaign built into your website or product will allow your  100 to get far more results than it ever could before   Once you have some viral aspects built in  it s time to kickstart your inbound marketing by spending your  100 in the most effective way possible  To do that  you need to understand something about paid ads   What is the key to paid ads   Most new entrepreneurs lose money on paid ads because they aren t familiar with  ad audience fit    The Key Is Advertisement  Audience Fit  When you take out an ad anywhere  you re choosing which audience you re showing it to  Even in the days before the internet  if you purchased ad space in a newspaper or magazine  the only way it would perform well is if it was relevant to the audience that s reading it  You wouldn t want to put an ad about hairspray in a men s fitness magazine  It probably wouldn t perform too well   But now that we have the internet  it s not a huge surprise that the principle stays the same  It s just a little more complicated with all of the data and advertising options available to us now   You have to discover an advertisement that your target audience is very interested in  This will lead to more clicks  conversions  and results for your business   for cheaper   Once you pick your audience  you must make an advertisement that resonates with them  which will result in a successful campaign   So you could say that having a highly targeted audience  that you know is interested in your subject  is the key to successful paid ads   But I have some bad news   This creates a problem for you   There are countless different audiences  keywords  and interests that you could target on a variety of different ad platforms  and you never know which ones are going to bring you the best results until you have  500  1K to properly test   So is it time for you to hang your head and go home   Not yet   Here s why   The Secret to Creating an Audience that Responds 400  more to your ads  Instead of finding an audience out there  what if I told you that you could create an audience where 100  of them are highly interested in your product   Now that sounds like a plan  And surprisingly  if you do this   100 could get you some solid results   The way to do that is by using retargeting   What is Retargeting   Retargeting is a form of advertising where you install a tracking code on your website  This allows you to target anyone who visits your website with ads on the biggest advertising networks including   Facebook  Twitter  Google Display Network  This means that your ads will only show to people that have visited your site  but your targeting can get as specific as people who have visited a specific page on your site   What does this result in   According to research revealed by Giselle Abramovich on CMO com  conventional ads average 0 07  click through rates  CTR s  while retargeted ads average a 0 7  CTR  That s 10X better   To get results like this  or better  you ll want to build an extremely specific retargeting audience from visitors to your site that have viewed a specific page   Creating Your Perfect  Targeted Audience  The best way to create an audience that you KNOW will be interested in your product will be to use some smart content marketing  Before you turn tail and run because you don t want to write content  hear me out   Content marketing is a big scary monster that scares the crap out of many entrepreneurs  But it s not that hard  At all  I showed you how to do everything in my post  How to Get Blog Traffic  13 Steps to Thousands of Readers    To create a successful ad campaign with  100  you will need to write a piece of content that  if a user clicks on it  immediately indicates that they d be interested in your product   For example  if I have a SaaS product that is a customer support solution  I may choose to write a post titled  10 Problems that need to be fixed in Customer Support Today  or  How to get more from your customer support team in 2016    Anyone that clicks on articles with these titles is clearly interested in the customer support space  and we can use their click on the article as a way to prequalify them as a hot prospect   Now when they read your article  they will begin to become familiar with your brand  This makes it so that the next time they visit your site  they are extremely likely to remember that they have been there before  and it establishes trust in your brand  In fact  once the visitor does click on your retargeted ad they are 70  more likely to convert on your website  Double win   Creating an Ad that performs 10X better for Your New Audience  Now that your relationship building sequence has started with your potential customer user  it s time to serve them your first retargeting ad  As I mentioned  statistics show that once you reach this point  your ad will perform on average 10X better than a conventional ad  In other words  in a conventional advertising campaign you could spend roughly  1000 to get the same amount of clicks on your ad   If we focus on just one platform  let s say Facebook  you can retarget visitors with a newsfeed ad template   Click here to download the template   Here s a real ad that I ve used that has performed well for lead generation   Serving Your Ad to Your New Audience  Now in order to make sure that you ad reaches your highly targeted audience  you will need to login to your ad interface and ensure that your ad is ONLY serving visitors of your targeted article   There are ways to do this on any of the ad platforms that allow retargeting  but let s continue our example of focusing on Facebook s platform   As you can see in their ads manager  you have the ability to only target people who have visited specific web pages in a selected time frame  as long as you have their retargeting pixel on your site  which I show you how to install here    Prioritize On Site Conversions  When I first started diving into paid ads  I found quickly that there are very simple things that can be done on your site that can have a huge increase in conversions  The difference between a 25  35  conversion rate and a 50  conversion rate can be as small as taking 10 minutes to add an exit popup   You think I m kidding   Just by adding this exit popup on one of my landing pages  I took my conversions from 30  to 55   That means that you ll get 83  better results for your money just by making some simple conversion tweaks   By making some other tweaks to your site  like I explain in my guide found here  you can easily double to triple your conversion rates  which is going to make your ads 2 3 times more effective   Increase Your Viral Coefficient  Once you have a flow of clicks and conversions coming in  you ll want to make the most out of those and increase the volume  To do this  you must focus on creating a stronger strategy that makes it easy for your existing users customers to share your product   To recap   For Apps   You will want to build some viral features into the fabric of your app  Non App Products   Attempt something like a viral giveaway or giving an incentive discount if a user shares your product  See how your first users have reacted to your viral features and try to make optimizations   Execute Grow  If you execute this strategy all the way through  you will have a solid growth engine in place for your startup   Once this engine is working  it will justify you committing more money and effort to make it grow faster   A system like this hands you what investors are constantly looking for  data  But even if you don t have access to investors  you can find a way to make back an equal or greater amount of cash from this growth strategy  you can continue investing your revenue back into the process to scale   Conclusion  After all  once you discover a strategy like this  it s pretty easy to understand why most startups fail at marketing  while some grow quickly and sustainably  The ones that manage to grow effectively are using marketing strategies that are 10 20X better than what most are doing  This means that they ll easily be able to accomplish in 1 2 years what most startups wouldn t be able to accomplish in 10 20   To help you reach that point  I ve put together a bonus guide for this post that includes   My other 2 favorite startup growth strategies for startups today  The ad templates that I ve used to create profitable ad campaigns  Video training on how to setup retargeting on your

447,training-dataset/product/790.txt,product,Don Norman s Principles of Interaction DesignWhen I first started learning about product design  one of the most influential books I read was The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman  In this classic work  Don Norman sheds light on the design of every day objects like doors  stoves  thermostats  and more  He then applies these universal design principles to designing technology products  Don Norman is one of the leading thinkers on human centered design and the principles he writes about are required reading for every product designer  I wanted to walk through each of Don Norman s six principles of designing interactions and how they remain relevant to designing digital products today Visibility is the basic principle that the more visible an element is  the more likely users will know about them and how to use them  Equally important is the opposite  when something is out of sight  it s difficult to know about and use As simple as this principle is  designers still struggle with adopting it  The trade off between hamburger side bar menus and tab bar menus in mobile applications is a very recent design debate centered around this very principle of visibility  While the hamburger menu provides a convenient place to store a variety of menu items in a mobile app  it comes at a huge disadvantage  the lack of visibility of the contained menu items  We ve seen a shift in major apps like Facebook away from hamburger menus and back toward tab bar menus to improve the visibility of their key experiences The skill in applying this principle is realizing that you can t make everything visible  because it ll ultimately clutter the interface but instead need to prioritize what interface elements are by far the most important for the user experience and prioritize their visibility Feedback is the principle of making it clear to the user what action has been taken and what has been accomplished  Many forms of feedback exist in interaction design  including visual  tactile  audio  and more  The key is to design the experience to never leave the user guessing about what action they have taken and the consequence of doing so We ve established a variety of design patterns for providing feedback to the user and these feedback patterns are constantly evolving as move interfaces emerge  Here s a brief video showing the many ways that Google s Material design pattern encourages you to provide feedback to the user on the actions they are taking in a mobile app Constraints is about limiting the range of interaction possibilities for the user to simplify the interface and guide the user to the appropriate next action  This is a case where constraints are clarifying  since they make it clear what can be done  Limitless possibilities often leave the user confused Conversational interfaces are all the rage these days because they provide the opportunity to speak to a computer via our natural language  which feels far more natural than the traditional user interface methods  However  to date these interfaces have struggled with a lack of constraints  with limitless possibilities of what you could potentially say to the conversational interface  it becomes impossible to know what kind of queries the interface actually supports  And given the technology today fails to be able to answer every possible query  the endless possibilities are frustrating to the user since it becomes difficult to even know how to use it Mapping is about having a clear relationship between controls and the effect they have on the world  You want this mapping to feel as natural as possible  Stove tops are a great example here  When you see the first image  the mapping is not very clear because it s difficult to determine which control operates each burner  Versus the second image  it s far clearer the control that controls each burner  which has a better mapping This slider also has a strong mapping  since it s clear moving it to the right will increase it s value versus moving it to the left will decrease it Apple shook up the world in 2011 when it introduced natural scrolling to Mac OS X Lion  This reversed the familiar pattern of scrolling a page down by holding your fingers on the trackpad and dragging them downward  Instead this was reversed such that you would drag your finger up on the trackpad to scroll the page down  This reversal more closely mapped with the way we used iPhones and iPads  The controversy here is really about a mapping  Was the new mapping too jarring because it changed the conventional mapping that had been used across Mac and Windows for decades  Or was it more natural because it mapped to how you would push a piece of paper up to move it down and also matched the new behavior created on mobile phones  There s no easy answer here  though I d say I myself turn off natural scrolling on my Mac because I  like many others  prefer the convention established decades ago Consistency refers to having similar operations and similar elements for achieving similar tasks  By leveraging consistent elements throughout your entire experience  you make your experience far easier to use  This consistency is important not only within your interface  but across the many interfaces users are using across their devices This is a simple example of poor consistency when you are using so many different styles for actions within your interface One of the best ways to drive consistency across applications is to make ample use of Google s Material Design Guidelines and iOS s Human Interaction Guidelines when designing mobile applications Affordance refers to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it  Essentially to afford means to give a clue  The physical button on a mouse gives a clue that it can be clicked to perform an action  When an object has strong affordances  it s very clear how to use it Don Norman talks at length about how doors often have poor affordances  When you come up to a door  it s not always clear do you push or pull the door  One convention used is to put a sheet of metal at around arm height on the side of the door that needs to be pushed to make it clear that it must be pushed instead of being pulled  When you do this  you are giving the door a strong affordance to indicate it should be pushed instead of pulled As web and mobile design has been evolving to more modern interfaces  in some ways we have been removing many of the common affordances we have classically used  For example  the blue underlined link used to be the strongest affordance for knowing something was a clickable link on the web  Many web experiences have moved away from this in an attempt to allow link elements to better match with the overall design aesthetic they are trying to achieve across the interface  While that s a helpful goal  we have to ensure that it s still clear what in fact are clickable links on the page using alternative affordances  like showing the underline on hover  When we remove all such affordances  the interface becomes meaningfully harder to use As you can see  all six of Don Norman s principles of interaction design remain as relevant today as they did when he originally authored his classic work  The Design of Everyday Things,"[447 1302 252 1196 411 501 623 342 472 1318

450,training-dataset/product/483.txt,product,Mobilized   MAA1   MediumBook review  Mobilized  I recently read  Mobilized  by SC Moatti   an insider s guide to the business and future of connected technology   SC Moatti is a mobile veteran from Silicon Valley  having developed successful mobile products and services at the likes of Nokia  Facebook and Trulia  Moatti makes the book s intentions clear in the first chapter  with businesses increasingly shifting their strategic focus to mobile  there s a need to create a truly mobile culture and mindset within the business  To help companies become mobile first  Moatti introduces the  Mobile Formula  which contains the three rules for successful mobile products   SC Moatti s  Mobile Formula   the three rules of successful mobile products   Taken from  https   www leanplum com blog mobilized on mobile   The Body Rule   The best mobile products operate by beauty  Contrary to what one might expect  the beauty in mobile products isn t about aesthetics  it s about eliminating waste   Efficiency  is the keyword here and Moatti refers to the Birkhoff formula in this respect  M O C  In this formula  M is a measure of beauty  O of simplicity and C of complexity  Beauty will increase with simplicity and will decrease through complexity   Measure simplicity through the  thumb test   Ultimately  the best measure of simplicity is to create a product that s easy to use by everyone  The so called  thumb test  is a great way to test whether your product is easy to use  To pass the thumb test  a task should be easily completed by a user with a thumb of average size and without incidentally hitting an unrelated link  button or design element by mistake  Take a look at AnkiDroid for instance  The flash cards on AnkiDroid s Android app make it easy to learn words in a different language  with clear buttons and calls to actions  see Fig  1 below    Fig  1   Screenshot of AnkiDroid   Taken from  http   www makeuseof com tag 6 flash card apps for android compared which is the best   Even the  thumb test  will become redundant  eventually   With voice command software like Apple s Siri  GreenOwl s service TrafficAlert and virtual reality all being hands free  the thumb test will eventually become a thing of the past  see Fig  2 below   Moatti argues that the principle underpinning the thumb test will still apply  beauty on mobile means that all user interactions need to work effortlessly and efficiently   Fig  2   Screenshot of TrafficAlert   Taken from  https   play google com store apps details id com greenowl ta android  The Spirit Rule   The best mobile products give us meaning  When describing  meaning  in the context of mobile products  Moatti identifies  personalisation  and  community  as the two key factors that add meaning  One might argue that these two factors contradict each other  but Moatti makes compelling arguments for both  Firstly   personalisation  is all about the user feeling cared for  by giving the user total control of the mobile experience  Contrary to what one might think  recent research shows that mobile products create deeper bonds between users and their communities  For example  a study by Kyung Gook Park at the University of Florida illustrates how mobile products make people feel more connected to those around them   Building for meaning   Mobile products as extensions of our spirit  Moatti makes some great points about the use of internal and external filters to create mobile products with meaning  Internal filters  Moatti explains  can be as simple as our location or address book  These internal filters help in connecting users to their environment  using location or user based data to create a personalised experience for the user  see example in Fig  3 below    Fig  3   Personalisation through onboarding on Beats  mobile streaming service   Taken from  http   www appvirality com blog personalization in retail apps   External filters come into play once it s understood what users care about through internal filters  External filters allow the experience to be shared and enjoyed with other people  For example  a privacy policy is an external filter  in place to outline what a product can and cannot reveal about its users   The Mind Rule   The best mobile products learn as we use them  The mind rule is the final component of Moatti s Mobile Formula  Mobile products constantly adapting is of the essence here  This adaptation can happen either fast or slow  Messaging app WhatsApp is a good example of adapting fast  The team at WhatsApp have adopted a culture of  continuous learning  where they learn from users and their behaviours on an ongoing basis  adding new features constantly  This is driven by a realisation that in order to keep up with the competition  they ll need to adapt relentlessly   In contrast  slow learning is all about breaking new ground  focusing on new users or launching new offerings  It basically comes down to taking one s fast or iterative learnings to the next level  creating new mobile divisions to conquer a new target market or value proposition  Whereas an existing mobile product or business might not be the best place to explore new territory  due to a fear of alienating an existing customer base  a completely separate app might be a better place to do so   Main learning point   Mobilized  really made me think about how to approach the creation and improvement of mobile products  Most books on mobile products concentrate on design  The great thing about SC Moatti s book is that it focuses on the mobile user instead  and provides great insights on how to best create a great user experience   Related links for further learning,"[450 623 1201 127 766

462,training-dataset/business/1110.txt,business,Scarcity  Abstraction   AbundanceEmergent Layers  Chapter 1  Scarcity  Abstraction   Abundance  This is part 1 of a four part series  Emergent Layers  If you haven t read the introduction  I invite you to do so here   There s a basic but powerful notion that all money is made at points of friction  I make money when I sell something for  10 that cost me  5  What entitles me to do this  Some sort of friction  after all  in a frictionless world  the sale would converge to a price of  5  Making money over the long run   i e  being durably profitable   means that a person or company is able to sit at a point of friction that is defendable and unavoidable  Where does this friction come from  How does it emerge  and how does it disappear  One good starting point is to examine the differences between scarce and abundant elements  or as Nassim Taleb classifies them in The Black Swan  non scalable and scalable entities   Borrowing from Taleb  let s consider the fate of Giaccomo  a 19th century local Italian musician living just before the advent of recorded music  Musical performance at this time is a decidedly non scalable affair  if you want to be musically entertained  you need to be present to a musician in person  As such  Giaccomo cannot scalably export his work  but neither can the big opera singers in Milan who might otherwise compete with him  Geography and physical proximity represent a strong point of friction   with only a handful of other musicians in town  Giaccomo can set a fair price and earn a decent profit so long as his vocal chords remain in good shape   Now imagine what happens with the invention of the phonograph  Suddenly poor Giaccomo is competing against the Milan big shots  His unit of trade  his voice  has been abstracted away into the etchings on a wax disc  As far as the residents of the town are concerned  this is a great development  They can now pay a fraction of what they used to  and in return receive an endlessly replayable recording of a superior artist  But for Giaccomo  this sucks  Physical proximity  which used to be a point of friction off of which he could extract earnings  is now easily circumvented  it becomes much harder for him to make a profit  or even get paid at all  Even if Giaccomo were able to get access to his own recording equipment  it would be to little avail  a new point of friction has emerged  distribution  with which he has no skill in dealing   Consider three very important things that have happened here   Musical performance  formerly a tangible  scarce  non scalable element  was abstracted away via technology into something scalable  The result was very good for ordinary people  who could now be entertained by the world s greatest artists in their own home for less money than it took to pay Giaccomo for an in person performance  It became very difficult for Giaccomo to make money  When this phase change took place  the point of friction around which he extracted his profit   physical proximity   ceased to matter  Making money off of music became a winner take all affair very quickly  From Giaccomo s perspective  this was a Black Swan event   impossible to see beforehand  retroactively explainable  and of grave consequence  Giaccomo could protest   it s not fair    and he d be right  It s not fair  And that s what makes it interesting  A new scarce and non scalable element emerged out of the new scalability of musical performance  distribution  An entirely new industry came to life  which we now know as record labels  who sit at the newfound point of friction and extract profit   This parable is useful for us for two reasons  The first is that it compactly demonstrates what happens when technological change abstracts away a scarce element  a point of friction thereby vanishes  and business models rearrange as a result  Generally  the result is good for the end user  but bad for those who depended on that point of friction to make a living  The second is that it illustrates very poignantly the difference between making money off of something scarce versus making money off of something abundant  They are entirely different exercises   Now let s return to present day  Throughout the rise of modern technology  its impact on the world has been led by a select group of companies that also happen to make dynastic amounts of money  These companies do not make all of this money because they are working marginally harder than their competitors  in the way that Giaccomo might compete with his fellow local musicians  They make this money for three reasons  they are the only game in town  they set the price  and the world has to play   Examples of these dynastic companies over the years include Intel  Microsoft  Cisco  Google  Apple and now Facebook  There is no doubt that the impact these companies have on the world is enormous  they are not only disproportionately valuable  but also disproportionately influential in shaping the future s course  Yet one has to wonder  how have these companies reached such a state  What entitles them to be the only game in town  in a way Giaccomo couldn t even imagine  Why can t anyone manage to compete with them effectively   The word  Monopoly  is appropriate here  But there s something very different about Google  for example  compared to the companies of last century that monopolized scarce resources and gouged customers  Google doesn t monopolize a scarce resource  Google abstracted away a scarce resource into something scalable and abundant  information and indexed knowledge available on the internet  They don t exert traditional monopoly power by withholding a resource and inflating prices  Google exerts their power by making that resource even more accessible  even more powerful  to every one of its users  When more information gets added to the Internet  Google gets stronger  not weaker  Facebook doesn t exert monopoly power by restricting who can be friends with whom  they exert their power by abstracting away the social graph and serving it so completely that if you want to reach those users  they re the only viable option  When more people come online  Facebook gets stronger   One foundational principle of the tech world is that as it builds upwards and outwards into the rest of the world  it s doing so by building on top of these abundant resources and progressively leveraging them  We can think about the world that we know and understand today   with its constraints  and business models and maturing industries that are generally understood by all   as forming a layer  which we ll call layer i  In time  as certain elements become abstracted and subsequently abundant  others emerge as newly scarce  or in play for new reasons and in new business models  The critical skill for understanding how this works  which is worth practicing   is being able to work one s way up and down between stack layers so as to understand when an abundant and scalable element has blossomed at layer i of a stack  and its scarce  non scalable counterpart has emerged at a new layer   which we ll call layer i 1   In order to understand the technology stack properly  it s best to start at the very bottom and work our way up through progressive layers of increased abstraction  so we can get a feel for how things layer on top of one another   Intel  The original scarce resource at layer i  computing power on purpose built chips  Back in the wild early days of transistors  the more functions you wanted in a product  the more single purpose transistor density you needed  This  function density  was built up and competed over by the early semiconductor firms  Shockley  Fairchild  and so forth  Then some people  at Fairchild and then subsequently at Intel  said  Hey  let s abstract away the function of a microchip into the instructions we gave it   in other words  make it generally programmable  Now  the number of different operations you could do on a chip became limitless  so long as you could write the assembly language for it  Intel became huge by building microprocessors  getting a sufficient head start  and then ensuring that everything got compiled for Intel assembly language  Computing power became an abundant resource  as we can empirically see in Moore s Law   Intel became dominant and mega profitable  while a new scarce resource emerged at layer i 1  PC hardware   Microsoft  The original scarce resource at layer i   PC hardware  In the early days of PCs  manufacturers could compete along many axes of performance   memory  speed  functionality  and so forth   while being sufficiently differentiated from one another  But it was very hard to standardize common functions and applications that people could run across any computer  making it difficult for these use cases to grow rapidly   until Bill Gates and Paul Allen realized  Hey  there isn t a software industry yet but there s gonna be  so we should start it  Microsoft abstracted away the capabilities of a computer into software  so now anyone else could write their own software on top of Microsoft s software without having to worry about the underlying machinery  PCs became an abundantly available commodity  and Microsoft became dominant and mega profitable  A new scarce resource emerged at layer i 1  the ability to connect these PCs and get them to talk to one another   Cisco  The original scarce resource at layer i   network access  Everyone wanted to participate in the early internet  but the ability to actually network a node to another node and get them talking to one another was a nightmare  With traffic on the internet attempting to grow exponentially  it s a huge problem to try to build around existing network protocols when you know they re going to be obsolete in 18 months anyway  Cisco abstracted away all of this by building and selling networking equipment that could tolerate this changing environment  making the internet something you could  just connect to  and it would work  Internet access became an abundantly available commodity  and as things consolidated around Internet Protocol  Cisco became dominant and mega profitable  A new scarce resource emerged at layer i 1  an understanding of the information contained on this network   Google  The original scarce resource at layer i   indexable information on the internet  There s now all this stuff on the internet that nobody knows how to organize  AOL  Yahoo Directory  Excite and so forth all had their various solutions  which kind of worked for a bit but then got hopelessly outmatched by the exponential growth of web pages  As a result  if you wanted to find anything  you had to use these portals stuffed with features that serve you all this noise and garbage but not what you re actually looking for  Then Larry and Sergei figured out  Hey  let s use links to abstract away the relationships between pages on the internet  so that indexable info could increase scalably and become abundant  Indexed Internet knowledge became an abundantly available commodity  and Google became dominant and mega profitable  A new scarce resource emerged at layer i 1  relationships between the people who consumed that web content   Facebook  Scarce resource at layer i   connections between humans using the internet  The internet was awash in people and content  but authentic human interaction was still relatively scarce and difficult  As such  all of the attempts at connecting people to content and advertising and services were feature stuffed  spammy  bloated and bad  The critical step forward that Facebook accomplished was abstracting away the  reciprocal friendship  into a functioning social graph  And we ve seen what s happened since  Facebook  and social connectivity in general  has exploded and become a newly abundant resource  Facebook became dominant and mega profitable   And so this cycle goes forth   from scarcity to abstraction to abundance  and then newfound scarcity  We can project this framework into the future if we wish  although great caution is required   We will work through how to do this thoroughly later on    One critical aspect of this layering is that at each higher level of abstraction  the lever with which one can create value and extract profit becomes successively longer  You can see this by looking at market cap per employee of these dominant companies   Intel  106k employees  55B revenue  149B mkt cap  Microsoft  120k employees  93B revenue  429B mkt cap  Google   Alphabet  60k employees 75B revenue  510B mkt cap  Facebook  13k employees  6B revenue  320B mkt cap  More recently  Whatsapp sold to Facebook for  19 billion of  FB a few years ago  in what turned out to be a great deal for both parties  with a double digit number of employees  Abstraction is a powerful thing   A non obvious but critical point to appreciate here is that for of the first n movers mobilizing around a scarce element  the arrival and eventual dominance of the last mover will be seen as a Black Swan event of sorts  By abstracting away the scarce resource instead of organizing around its scarcity  these companies become the first to be fully playing in the sandbox at level i 1  as opposed to the non scalable scarcity governed sandbox at level i  where Giaccomo lives  To be sure  some  or perhaps a lot of  luck goes into any given company emerging as the last mover   many things have to go right  and we tend not to hear about companies who independently arrive at the right idea but fail to thrive for whatever reason  luck or otherwise  Furthermore  as we ll see later  sometimes those last mover companies don t initially realize what they have on their hands at all  But until they actually explode upwards in scale  it s not obvious at all who they ll be  or what they do  or why they ll be any different than the first n players  It s easy for Giaccomo to compare himself to other musicians in town  or even to the great musicians in Milan  But he doesn t think about how he might compete in an era of recorded music  he doesn t know the right questions to ask   As a more recent example  the last decade saw plenty of startups go after the transportation market  and I m sure all of them described themselves as  scalable  in their investor decks  Meanwhile  the whole valley was busy passing on Uber because it was initially just a better way to do a black car service  and few people understood the true scalable potential in abstracting away the driver rider trust required for UberX  The take home lesson here should be taken to heart  when the first n companies go after an issue  no matter what language they use in their pitch  their business models typically don t truly venture beyond the constraints at layer i that anybody can see and understand  They re easier to work through  make more sense to  rational investors   and require fewer non linear leaps of thinking to understand  As such  when the last mover emerges at level i 1  they re a Black Swan event  few people foresaw their opportunity  their impact is enormous  and everybody rationalizes what happened after the fact   This cycle from scarcity to abstraction to abundance at level i and newly emergent scarcity at level i 1 doesn t simply proceed in a straight line  Alongside this  trunk  of technological progression  we see branches sprout off that spawn many great and valuable companies with winner take all dynamics of their own  By thriving in an environment of newfound abundant resources  offshoot companies often find other new or adjacent scarce resources to be quite conquerable from their new powerful vantage point  The Giaccomos of these adjacent industries usually don t stand a chance   the new tech companies are harnessing the leverage of the entire tech stack  and as such have been eating into the rest of the world at an accelerating rate  Ultimately  the companies that win make money through entirely different business models and with entirely different constraints than their predecessors,"[462 947 926 1074 765 217 1166 1181 1256 913 1302]"
467,training-dataset/engineering/914.txt,engineering,Improving Video Playback on Android   Instagram EngineeringImproving Video Playback on Android  As Instagram has grown  and mobile network bandwidth has improved  video has become a larger part of the app experience  The time people spent watching video in the last half increased by more than 40   and yesterday  we announced longer video to give creators more flexibility and open up new ways to connect with the community  In this post  we ll share some of the things we ve done to improve video playback on Android and maintain user experience while increasing video length 4x   Instagram introduced 15 second video in 2013  One of our core engineering values is  Do the Simple Thing First   so we implemented a basic video playback mechanism on Android  When a video appears in feed  the app first downloads the whole video file to the phone storage  After the download is complete  the file is passed to the Android built in MediaPlayer to play the video   This design worked well when the maximum video length was only 15 seconds  However  we recently decided to increase the maximum video length to 60 seconds  We recognized this would stress our current design for a few reasons   Video cannot play until the whole file is downloaded  As the video becomes larger  playback would wait even longer for the video to download  People on slower network connections might need to wait for a very long time before they can play the first second of the video  Video won t play if there s a disk space issue  If there is not enough space in the disk to store the whole video file in the disk cache or if there s some failure in the I O  the video will never play   With those issues in mind  we decided to build a new video cache that could stream the video to the MediaPlayer as the video file is being downloaded  This would remove the bottleneck of waiting for the download to finish   We started to look into how to build a streaming video cache that worked with our current video player  We found that the Android MediaPlayer only supports playing a video from either a file or a URL  We wouldn t have the complete video file to give to the MediaPlayer when we are still downloading  so this leaves us with playing the video from a URL  The naive approach of passing our CDN URL to the MediaPlayer would mean that we wouldn t have any control over the bytes downloaded  so we would not be able to cache the video in case a person wanted to watch it again  Knowing this fact  we decided to have the MediaPlayer interact with a local proxy server instead  and have the proxy server serve the byte stream to the media player while also storing it into the disk cache   It turns out that this new design solves many of the problems in the previous design with some extra benefits   Playback is no longer blocked by the video download  i e  it plays as soon as there s enough content  Playback is no longer dependent on disk space  Even if the disk cache malfunctions  it would just be treated as a cache miss and streamed directly from the server  Allows more prefetching adjustments  This new mechanism allows us to explore more options in regard to prefetching video files depending on the network condition  as the prefetched content can now be directly streamed while we download the rest of the file on background   We tested our new implementation extensively across many devices and Android versions  Our testing surfaced an issue  Some Android Lollipop devices made multiple  up to 3  download requests before playing the video   they would request the beginning of the file  then make a HTTP range request for the end of the file  then request the beginning again  To figure this out  we need to understand a little about the mp4 file format  An mp4 is a container for one or more video and audio tracks  and it contains metadata that specifies where each of these tracks start  We had already reconfigured our video encoding to place this metadata at the start of the file  instead of the end  the default   to avoid the inefficient behavior of making multiple requests to play the video  We hypothesized that the MediaPlayer was not playing nice with our video encoding   Upon deeper investigation  we managed to scope the problem down to devices that use NuPlayer  which is the default implementation of MediaPlayer starting in Lollipop  replacing the older AwesomePlayer   Looking deeper into the MPEG4Extractor and NuCachedSource2 code  we deduced that NuPlayer was not handling one of the MP4 container atoms  specifically  the FREE atom  correctly and was getting confused  Removing FREE atoms solved the problem  and we modified our video transcoding tier to include this cleanup logic before we launched the new video playback  We were pretty satisfied with the result of the new implementation   Below are some of the  statistically significant  results we gathered after performing a limited A B test of streaming vs  non streaming playback with 15 second videos in the wild   The table above shows three metrics  percentage of videos played within 1 second of scrolling on screen  the average start delay to the first frame of the video  and the 95th percentile of the start delay distribution  We initially started by gathering data on the number of videos played within 1 second and the average start delay for all videos  We noticed that the new streaming cache performed worse for the number of videos that played within 1 second  0 8  fewer videos   but better for average time to play  18  lower  Since these results contradicted each other  we dug in to analyze the data further   We sliced the data to exclude videos that started playing within 200ms  The majority of the videos that play within 200ms are probably cached fully on disk  which shouldn t be affected by our new implementation  We hypothesized that removing the data  noise  from these cached videos would help us get a more accurate measurement of the impact of the streaming player  and help us to understand the discrepancy in performance between less than 1 second video play time vs  the average  Removing the lower end of the distribution gave us a more accurate view of the impact of the streaming player  the average and p95 time to play are faster by 22 28   However  this still didn t explain why the number of videos that played within 1 second was actually lower with streaming enabled  We dug in deeper still and plotted the time to play distribution of the videos   This plot shows the percentage of videos  y axis  that are played within a certain number of seconds  x axis   Looking at the distribution  we see that the streaming cache  black bars  improved the start time in general  but it seemed to regress the start time for videos that had formerly fallen into the 0 1 second bucket  To try to explain this result  we circled back to check the implementation of MediaPlayer  We discovered that using the setUrl API incurs an artificial 1 second start delay on some older versions of Android MediaPlayer  to give the streaming buffer extra time to fill   This matches the data plot above and explains the result we gathered  In general  the streaming cache has shifted the distribution to the left  you can see the long tail of only blue bars   but pushes some of the leftmost distribution slightly to the right  The impact of this artificial delay is minimal  because we wrote code to shortcut the proxy server and play the file directly if it is fully cached  the setFile API does not have a delay    We did the simple thing first when we first launched video on Instagram  and shipped a stable and robust video viewing experience to our users in a timely manner  But doing the simple thing first does not mean that we sacrifice quality or performance  On the contrary  we focus on what matters most at the time and continuously reevaluate what we have to make sure that the whole app experience is top notch  Video playback is one recent example where changing product requirements led us to rethink our initial assumptions  It also showcases the importance of collecting and analyzing data to verify that performance improvements are actually working as expected  We hope that by providing a better video playback experience we will enable more people to enjoy the moments that they have captured and shared on Instagram,"[467 1210 1358 351 885 162 571 947 926 1256 1059]"

especially true  How can we  as practitioners  keep growing our perspectives as existing platforms continue to evolve and entirely new platforms arrive   What follows is a meditation on this question  specifically around the new platforms of virtual reality  VR   augmented reality  AR   and mixed reality  MR  and some ideas on how to keep your eyes on the rapidly moving target of anticipating the

led us to user experience  which now leads us onward to experience design   Having paid attention over the past 20 years or so  here s my take   The first 10 years   1997 2007   Usability design  In the beginning  usability design was all about reducing friction between the user and technology  Designing anything during this time meant the user was an afterthought   Until the thing was in the wild  only then would someone  like me  say   Oh  it s not at all friendly to use  What can we do to improve that   As long as the product met the basic business requirements  it was fine   The past 10 years   2007   2017   UX design  On June 29  2007  iPhones changed the rules  A single  agnostic piece of technology with more focus on the user than before  This has become the norm  Designing devices for users now comes first  Everything else comes second   People ignore technology that isn t friendly to use  And they should  Steve Jobs  vision of the iPhone set a new precedent for today   The experience of using a product or a service has become the new normal  Products have to be usable and engaging and they have to inspire a sense of delight   They also need to align with a company s

still working hard to get user experience right  it won t be enough in the years to come   Emerging platforms like VR  AR  and wearables aren t used in the traditional sense anymore  For example   Nest s self learning thermostat saves you energy without you having to do a thing  Siri can send that text for you while you re driving  Fitbit s SmartTrack recognizes and records your exercises for you  You can keep track of your workouts without ever pushing a button  Alexa notifies us that it s time to hop in the car if we re going to make it to that appointment on time  The balance is tipping over to the experience side of user experience  VR  AR  and MR are raising expectations to a whole new level  In a year  things will have changed even more   The future of UX design  The trend is less user and more experience  Designers are already shifting focus in this way   So as a UX designer  how do you prepare for what s coming  How do you stay relevant   How much psychological insight into people do you have  The increasing focus on experience requires a sixth sense into human sensibilities  Those gifted with deep empathy and social insight will succeed  Being able to expect the needs of our audiences will determine our level of success   Are you a good communicator  or do you only think you are  Invest in talking to people  and actually listen to what they want  need  and fear   Related  See the UX design trends for 2017  These are the anticipatory design methods that will deliver the most value  Technology should expect our audience s actions and needs   Get competent in the

476,training-dataset/business/782.txt,business,Beyond the iPhone   Stratechery by Ben ThompsonI enjoy the writing of Farhad Manjoo  tech columnist at The New York Times  but I was prepared for the hottest of hot takes when I saw his latest column  penned just hours after Apple s latest product unveiling  was titled What s Really Missing From the New iPhone  Dazzle  Once I read it  though  I found a lot to agree with   Apple has squandered its once commanding lead in hardware and software design  Though the new iPhones include several new features  including water resistance and upgraded cameras  they look pretty much the same as the old ones  The new Apple Watch does too  And as competitors have borrowed and even begun to surpass Apple s best designs  what was iconic about the company s phones  computers  tablets and other products has come to seem generic  It s not just that a few new Apple products have been plagued with design flaws  The bigger problem is an absence of delight   Indeed  it sure seemed to me while watching yesterday s keynote that the level of excitement and  well  delight peaked early and gradually ebbed away as Apple CEO Tim Cook and his team of presenters got deeper into the details of Apple s new hardware  Of course a lot of that had to do with the shocking appearance of the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto of Nintendo  on hand to announce Super Mario Run exclusively for iOS   The Nintendo news was certainly a surprise  but it actually fit in quite well thematically with the opening of the keynote  first was a video of Tim Cook and Carpool Karaoke creator James Corden in a funny skit and a not too subtle reminder that Apple recently bought the upcoming Carpool Karaoke series as an exclusive for Apple Music  That was followed by touting the success of Apple Music and the fact it has  content no one else has    i e  more exclusives  Following that up with Mario sure seemed to suggest that Apple was increasingly going to leverage its war chest to differentiate its  good enough  phones   The Threat of  Good Enough   It has been clear for many years that the threat to iPhone growth was not modular Android but the iPhones people already have  The hope with last year s iPhone 6S launch was that new features like 3D Touch and Live Photos would be compelling enough to drive upgrades  but it turned out that many would be upgraders had already bought the iPhone 6 and the rest didn t care  the result was the first iPhone that sold less than a previous model   At first glance  as Manjoo noted  the iPhone 7 doesn t seem like it will do much to reverse that trend  it s mostly the same as the two year old iPhone 6 people bought instead of the iPhone 6S  and folks still using older iPhones may very well upgrade   if they upgrade at all   to the cheaper iPhone SE or the newly discounted 6S  After all  as multiple commentators have noted  the most talked about feature of the iPhone 7 is what it doesn t have   the headphone jack  Surely no headphone jack   no dazzle   no growth  right   Well  probably  I have been and remain relatively pessimistic about this iPhone cycle  perhaps because I was overly optimistic last year   However  I was actually very impressed by what Apple introduced yesterday  many of the products and features introduced didn t make for flashy headlines  but they laid the foundation for both future iPhone features and  more importantly  a future beyond the iPhone   The iPhone 7 Plus Camera  The annual camera upgrade is always one of the best reasons to upgrade an iPhone  especially if you have little kids creating irreplaceable memories that you want to capture in as high a fidelity as possible  And  as usual  Apple and its suppliers have delivered a better lens  a better sensor  and a better image processor  along with image stabilization on both the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus  the iPhone 6S did not have image stabilization  while the iPhone 6S Plus did    The iPhone 7 Plus  though  retains a photographic advantage over its smaller sibling thanks to the fact it actually has two cameras   One camera uses the familiar 28mm equivalent lens found on the iPhone 7  while the second has a 56mm equivalent lens for superior zooming capabilities  2x optical  which also means digital zooming is viable at longer distances   Apple also demonstrated an upcoming software feature that recreates the shallow depth of field that is normally the province of large sensored cameras with very fast lenses   This effect is possible because of those two lenses  because they are millimeters apart  each lens  sees  a scene from a slightly different perspective  By comparing the two perspectives  the iPhone 7 Plus  image processor can build a depth map that identifies which parts of the scene are in the foreground and which are in the background  and then artificially apply the bokeh that makes a shallow depth of field so aesthetically pleasing   Bokeh  though  is only the tip of the iceberg  what Apple didn t say was that they may be releasing the first mass market virtual reality camera  The same principles that make artificial bokeh possible also go into making imagery for virtual reality headsets  Of course you probably won t be able to use the iPhone 7 Plus camera in this way   Apple hasn t released a headset  for one   but when and if they do  the ecosystem will already have been primed  and you can bet FaceTime VR would be an iPhone seller   Apple s willingness and patience to lay the groundwork for new features over multiple generations remains one of its most impressive qualities  Apple Pay  for example  didn t come until the iPhone 6  but the groundwork had already been laid by the introduction of Touch ID and the secure element in the iPhone 5S  Similarly  while Apple introduced Bluetooth beacons in 2013 and the Apple Watch in 2014  the company had actually been shipping the necessary hardware since 2011 s iPhone 4S  I wouldn t be surprised if we look back at the iPhone 7 Plus  dual cameras with similar appreciation   The Headphone Jack  In one of the more tone deaf moments in Apple keynote history  Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller justified the aforementioned removal of the headphone jack this way   The reason to move on   I m going to give you three of them   but it really comes down to one word  courage  The courage to move on  do something new  that betters all of us  and our team has tremendous courage   Schiller should have stuck to the three reasons  the superiority of Lightning  meh   the space gained by eliminating the headphone jack  and Apple s vision for audio on mobile devices   Start with the space  getting rid of the headphone jack fits with the multi year feature creation I detailed above  current rumors are that next year s 10th anniversary iPhone will be nothing but a screen  Making such a phone  though  means two fundamental changes to the iPhone  first  the home button needs  well  a new home  last year s introduction of 3D Touch and the iPhone 7 s force touch home button lay the groundwork for that  That headphone jack  though  is just as much of an impediment  try to find one phone or music player of modern thinness that has the headphone jack under the screen  the best example of the space issues I m referring to  the 6th generation iPod nano    Still  that s speculation  Apple insists iPhone 7 users will see the benefits right away  Apple executives told BuzzFeed that removing the headphone jack made it possible to bring that image stabilization to the smaller iPhone 7  gave room for a bigger battery  and eliminated a trouble spot when it came to making the iPhone 7 water resistant  It s a solid argument  albeit one not quite worth Schiller s hubris   That said  the third reason   Apple s vision of the future   is such a big deal for Apple in particular that I just might be willing to give Schiller a pass   AirPods and the Future  Jony Ive  in his usual pre recorded video  introduced the AirPods like this   We believe in a wireless future  A future where all of your devices intuitively connect  This belief drove the design of our new wireless AirPods  They have been made possible with the development of the new Apple designed W1 chip  It is the first of its kind to produce intelligent  high efficiency playback while delivering a consistent and reliable connection  The W1 chip enables intelligent connection to all of your Apple devices and allows you to instantly switch between whichever one you are using  And of course the new wireless AirPods deliver incredible sound  We re just at the beginning of a truly wireless future we ve been working towards for many years  where technology enables the seamless and automatic connection between you and your devices   Putting aside the possibility of losing the AirPods   and the problem that not everyone s ears can accommodate one shape   and it really looks like Apple is on to something compelling  By ladling a bit of  special sauce  on top of the Bluetooth protocol  Apple has made the painful process of pairing as simple as pushing a button  Even more impressive is that said pairing information immediately propagates to all of your Apple devices  from MacBooks to Watch  As someone who has long since moved to Bluetooth headphones almost exclusively I can absolutely vouch for Apple s insistence that there is a better way than wires  and the innovations introduced by the AirPod  which are also coming to Beats  help the headphone jack medicine go down just a bit more easily   What is most intriguing  though  is that  truly wireless future  Ive talked about  What happens if we presume that the same sort of advancement that led from Touch ID to Apple Pay will apply to the AirPods  Remember  one of the devices that pairs with AirPods is the Apple Watch  which received its own update  including GPS  The GPS addition was part of a heavy focus on health and fitness  but it is also another step down the road towards a Watch that has its own cellular connection  and when that future arrives the iPhone will quite suddenly shift from indispensable to optional  Simply strap on your Watch  put in your AirPods  and  thanks to Siri  you have everything you need   Ah  but there is the catch  I have long held up this vision  of pure voice computing  as Apple s Waterloo  I wrote about it when the the Watch came out   I also think that when the Watch inevitably gains cellular functionality I will carry my iPhone far less than I do today  Indeed  just as the iPhone makes far more sense as a digital hub than the Mac  the Watch will one day be the best hub yet  Until  of course  physical devices disappear completely  That is the ultimate Apple bear case   The truly wireless future that Ive hinted at doesn t just entail cutting the cord between your phone and your headphones  but eventually a future where phones may not even be necessary  Given that Apple s user experience advantages are still the greatest when it comes to physically interacting with your device  and the weakest when it comes to service dependent interactions like Siri  that is a frightening prospect   And that is why I ultimately forgive Schiller for his  courage  hubris  To Apple s credit they are  with the creation of AirPods  laying the foundation for a world beyond the iPhone  It is a world where  thanks to their being a product   not services   company  Apple is at a disadvantage  however  it is also a world that Apple  thanks to said product expertise  especially when it comes to chips  is uniquely equipped to create  That the company is running towards it is both wise   the sooner they get there  the longer they have to iterate and improve and hold off competitors   and also  yes  courageous  The easy thing would be to fight to keep us in a world where phones are all that matters  even if  in the long run  that would

477,training-dataset/product/1358.txt,product,The essential usability checklist for web appsEditor s note  This is a chapter from Jane Portman s new book  The UI Audit   User interface design is an amazing industry  it originates from the 10 000 foot view of business strategy  while being a rock solid practical craft  No wonder it intimidates everyone  especially SaaS founders  In my new book  The UI Audit  I set out to debunk the UI UX myths about web applications all to provide simple  actionable techniques that actually correlate with product strategy   How do you make your web app layouts simple and focused  How do you make sure your UI correlates with the user s important goals and tasks   Let me show you the exact method for auditing your screen layouts  In this chapter you ll list the key screens of your web application and run a usability checklist on each of them  You ll learn about the 5 key components of an ideal screen and define your biggest UX challenges   Prep work  define your product strategy  First you need to write down your product strategy  You re welcome to download the complete free chapter and worksheets on product strategy here   The 4 components you need to define are   Audience  who are your ideal users  Goal  what big goal do they have in mind when they sign up  Tasks  what tasks do they perform daily when they log into your web app  Objects  what items do the users handle while performing these tasks   This product strategy will guide all your design decisions  so keep it in front of your eyes at all times   List the key screens  Let s list the key screens in your app  Those screens are the most important  They facilitate the tasks from your product strategy  Omit the remaining  service area  of your web app  account  settings  authentication  etc   For the best results  work through your web app  starting from the very sign in  Where does the user land when they log into your app daily  Where do they usually go from there  Go through all the items in your main navigation   Now let s run the usability checklist  The ideal screen has these 5 things done right   One huge title Obvious navigation One list of objects  or a single object  per screen One prominent task per screen One prominent CTA per screen  1  One big title  One of the greatest challenges for the user is to understand the context of what they see  You d think they would remember what link they clicked on before landing here  and wouldn t lose context   but their memory is surprisingly short  A big title will definitely help them regain their context   Somewhere above the fold where titles usually appear you should clearly state what the screen is about  It can either be the name of the screen itself  Dashboard  Clients  Product Details  or the name of the object you re describing on this page  product name  client name  etc     2  Obvious navigation  For an individual screen  obvious navigation means that 2 things should be obvious to the user  Where am I now  and How can I go back   Here s what you can do to answer the first question  Where am I now   Include a big title  as described above   Make sure the current section stands out well in the navigation bar  That s not completely exhaustive  there might be a second level of navigation that s not visible   but it definitely helps   Use the breadcrumbs  they help a lot to understand where the user is  and conveniently link to all relevant sections of the app  Here s what you can do to answer the second question  How can I go back to where I was before   Include Go back to  somewhere close to the top of the screen  Notice that Go back to the product list works much better than just Go back it has an action verb and clearly states where the user came from   Make sure the browser Back button works in a predictable manner  3  One list of objects  or a single object  per screen  Each screen should only have one list of objects  or a single object you re describing  It makes any web app deadly simple to build  use  and convert to mobile responsive if necessary   No matter what the device limitations  you can always use the vertical space generously  it s one of the safest usability assumptions  Nevertheless  it comes with a big if if the content is monotonous   When a user sees a table header and a monotonous list of objects  they automatically assume it s all there is  If you add important content or another list underneath that  it might never get discovered   In more complex screens  you have to deal with 2 or 3 screen areas that need to be visible at once  which often becomes a challenge with smaller devices   There are of course exceptions to the rule   complex software that s used on desktop computers  where the user traditionally has a large monitor CRM systems  graphic and engineering apps  etc   hardly ever used  in the field     Dashboard  Homescreen  Profile  or similar  which can include a sequence of list  previews  leading to actual sections of the app   situations where the key experience is drag and drop between 2 work areas   screens where a lot of small settings or elements are combined   For all these exceptions  it s a rule of thumb to include big second level headlines   So what should you do when your screen has more than one list  and it might be a problem  Break it down into a few simple screens  Name those screens to identify the objects shown  and try to accommodate them in your navigation  usually they fit well in the same navigation level as the original screen    Another frequently used  hack  is to use tabs to accommodate several object lists under the same header area  In this case  make sure the header area doesn t occupy too much vertical space  Another concern here is that tabs work poorly for narrow screens  like tablet or mobile versions    4  One primary task per screen  Each key screen should facilitate just one primary task from your strategy worksheet  Go out of your way to super optimize each screen for one core experience such as browsing items  reading  watching  writing  calling clients  or anything like that   It s your magic key to building successful software  Whenever you define that primary task  all your decisions about organizing this screen become much easier   Imagine we re designing a contact table for a CRM system  The primary task here would be call a lead  Ask yourself  what data is necessary for the sales agent to qualify a suitable lead and make that call  Preferably without leaving the comfort of this working environment   Current lead status and the latest activity will help the agent to qualify the lead  The client s name and phone number are necessary to make the call  But does their email address matter to someone making a call  Probably not therefore  you can easily omit it   Real usability success happens when you streamline this key task really well  Make the user s most important workflow one click shorter  a bit more convenient  a bit more pleasant   What should you do if you have 2 tasks per screen or more  It can definitely happen  Just pick one primary task and focus on optimizing it  Other tasks can exist  and even be taken in consideration  but that primary task should always have more influence on your decisions   Sometimes it s easier said than done  During client UI audits  I would stare at a single screen and be amazed at its complexity  I d think   How in the world can I apply my own  one task  rule here   The answer is  if you do the one list exercise first  then your one task becomes much easier to identify   5  One prominent CTA per screen  It s also true that each screen should have just one big call to action button  The human eye doesn t like to be distracted with a variety of choices  Quite the opposite  we prefer to be guided into a single important action  There definitely can be more  but they should be more subtle   That single CTA might not be the same as the key task above  For the contact list in a CRM system  a prominent CTA button will probably be add new lead  while the important task will be call a lead   What s the difference  The previous one task rule above usually relates to existing list items  If you use a big CTA button for each list item to represent this task  the UI will look overwhelming  Such buttons should be subtle   This one CTA rule  on the contrary  relates to something you can do with the list itself  add new items  export the list  etc    Here one big CTA becomes desirable and acceptable   There s also a modification of this rule that you can use  one prominent CTA per screen area  This means your navigation bar can have one big CTA  while your workspace can have another and they ll co exist just fine   What should you do if you have too many CTAs that look equally important  Pick one that represents the most desirable popular action  Make the remaining CTAs more subtle  smaller buttons or inline links    Practicum  Take a sheet of paper  List the key screens in your app  For each screen  answer 4 questions   What is the title of the screen  Is it large and bold enough   Is it obvious where we are  How can we go back   What objects are shown in this screen  Is it just one list of objects  or a single object  per screen   What are the tasks that the screen facilitates  Is it just one task per screen  Am I doing a great job at making this task as comfortable as possible   What is the primary CTA for this screen  Are any other CTAs competing for attention   This should give you a whole new perspective on your existing software  Did you find many complications inconsistencies in your screens  Which screens turned out to be the most challenging   Final words  If you re interested in optimizing UI UX design of web

480,training-dataset/product/875.txt,product,Make Your Product Stand Out with the Strategy CanvasThe Strategy Canvas  The Strategy Canvas was developed by Kim and Mauborgne  the authors of Blue Ocean Theory  It was originally intended as a business strategy tool to discover new markets  Luckily  the canvas can also be applied to individual products  as the following example illustrates  1   The Strategy Canvas above ranks the first iPhone against its rivals  including the Nokia N95 and the BlackBerry Curve  The horizontal axis of the canvas captures the key factors companies compete on to provide their products  In the example above  there are twelve factors  which range from offering different models to stylish design   The vertical axis of the Strategy Canvas describes the offering level  the degree to which the competitors offer the factors  Video  for instance  was not offered on the original iPhone but it was provided by its competitors  a camera was available on the first iPhone but it s quality was inferior compared to the competition  but its media player was better  and the iPhone offered two new factors  a touch screen and a stylish design   By assessing the degree to which the iPhone and the competitor products fulfil the twelve factors  two lines are created  The dark one represents the value curve of the smartphone industry in 2007  the light one the first iPhone   When comparing the two lines  we see that the they diverge  This means that the first iPhone was clearly differentiated  Apple achieved this by removing certain features  such as physical keyboard  stylus  and video  reducing some  including voice quality and e mail integration  and improving others  for example  mobile Internet and media player  Additionally  the two new factors the touch screen and stylish design gave the phone a significant competitive advantage and helped Apple disrupt the mobile phone market    1  The sample canvas is based on Disruptive Product Innovation Strategy  The Case of Portable Digital Music Players   Applying the Canvas to Your Product  Before applying the Strategy Canvas  you should be clear on your product s value proposition the main problem it solves or the primary benefit it provides and the market segment you want to serve  I capture these pieces of information using my Product Vision Board   The canvas therefore complements the board in my approach   Additionally  you should know who your main competitors are   Start creating the canvas by determining the key factors  Make sure you choose those factors that define the current standard in your market and are used to advertise and sell products  rather than the ones that favour your own product  Product reviews and test reports can help you discover the right factors  since they compare a product against the expected standard  Additionally  limit the number of factors you use to about ten  This creates focus and avoids an overly complex canvas   With the key factors in place  rank the competing offerings and your own product taking into account the degree to which they fulfil the factor  This is not meant to be a scientific exercise but based on the information you have collected whilst identifying the key factors  Consider if a factor is fulfilled not at all  hardly  to some extent  or fully  and rank the products accordingly   With the scores in place  represented as dots or circles  connect them to create the value curves  Think about joining up the curves of the competitors to create clarity  as I did in the Strategy Canvas above  While this carries the risk of overlooking some details  it simplifies the canvas and makes it easier to see where the main opportunities are for making your product stand out   If the value curve of your product is too close to the curve of the competition  then you haven t differentiated your product sufficiently  You will subsequently find it hard to explain to your users and customers why they should choose your product  What you would like to see instead is a value curve that significantly diverges from the industry standard  like the white dotted one in the Strategy Canvas above  This is achieved by eliminating  reducing  and raising the appropriate key factors  and by creating new ones  The Eliminate Reduce Raise Create Grid can help you with this   Use the Strategy Canvas not only for brand new products  Regularly check if an existing product is still adequately differentiated or if the competition has caught up with it  Take the iPhone  If we consider how the smartphone market has changed since the launch of the iPhone  we see that the competitors have matched the original iPhone s features  Trying to stay ahead of the competition  Apple has introduced and raised several factors over the years  including the ability to install third party apps  the number and size of iPhone models  the battery life  and the camera and video capabilities   Learn More  You can learn

501,training-dataset/product/1242.txt,product,8 tips for designing mobile friendly websitesAccording to Smart Insights  80  of internet users own a smartphone  That s millions of people browsing the web  trying to find products and information on the go  To satisfy potential customers  every company must make their site easy to navigate on mobile devices   Here are some tips drawn from our experience at Sonifi to help you design and develop a mobile friendly website   Related  Mobile UX and user expectations  Tip 1  All mobile sites need a viewport meta tag  Remember to include a viewport meta tag when building a mobile site  The viewport is a virtual realm used by search engines to determine how a site s content is scaled and sized  making including a meta tag critical when building a multi device experience   The viewport meta tag tells the mobile browser that it must fit a smaller screen  Without it the site will simply not operate well on a mobile device  No matter which configurations you choose to use to specify your viewport to control  make sure it s included at the head of the document   Tip 2  For mobile websites  size matters  Have you ever visited a site on your mobile device that prompted you to select a button  but the button was so small that you ended up pressing the wrong thing instead  Or have you ever had to zoom in just to read something   It s terribly frustrating  which is why it s important to remember that when it comes to mobile design  size matters and not just the size of the page  but also the size of the fonts and buttons   Fonts  Font size on mobile sites should be at least 14px  Though this may seem bigger than you d initially want  it makes the content easy for viewers to read without forcing them to zoom in for legibility  In general  the only time font should be smaller is on labels or forms  when you can drop it back to 12px   Buttons  Remember this acronym BBAB  Bigger Buttons Are Better  Big buttons simply reduce the chances that the user will mistakenly hit the wrong button or miss it all together  Mobile leaders like Apple recommend that button sizes should be at least 44px by 44px in order to maximize user experience and increase conversions on ecommerce sites   Tip 3  Pop ups or refreshes shouldn t be used in mobile web design  Even small pop ups can cause a big headache for mobile viewers  Because mobile browsers don t typically support pop ups  when they are present they make the entire user experience frustrating   Throughout the design process  make sure you avoid using pop ups for the best mobile results  Similarly  do away with periodic refreshes to prevent filling the mobile device s limited device cache  If the page needs refreshing  let the viewer have control   Related  3 ways to be just pushy enough on mobile  Tip 4  Reduce user text entry required for navigation  As you probably know  it s often incredibly difficult to input text in mobile versions of websites  Reduce user text entry by replacing it with buttons or a list instead  so viewers can select what they need with ease and without fussing with text input   Keep in mind that  unlike desktop users  mobile users don t have access to a traditional keyboard or mouse  so use creativity to develop different ways viewers can still have the same user experience without having to use small keyboards or challenging navigation   Some solutions include   Checklists  Drop down menus  Buttons  Image selections  Tip 5  Use creative navigation placement in your design  Before you started building your website  you probably did a significant amount of research to get to know your audience and what they are looking for in a website  Revisit this information when optimizing for mobile to determine how the particular audience will want to navigate the site   If your targeted users want to see quickly changing content  position the navigation menu below the main material  This will leave room for the content and headlines to be visible without obstructing the page view   On the other hand  if viewers want immediate access to category navigation  you should place the navigation menu at the top of the page   Tip 6  Simplify the design of your site  Rid your site of unnecessary content and simplify the site s design to create ultimate usability  Remember that the  mobile first  approach is all about minimalism  and simplifying the design helps improve usability   Create a site that lets users navigate the site with zero difficulty by avoiding the inclusion of tables  frames  and other formatting  Keep padding to an absolute minimum  because the more users click on links  the longer they will wait for load time  Simplify your website to create a balance between content and navigation   Tip 7  Break the page into small sections  Taking content that displays well on large desktop computers and cramming it onto a small  handheld device is sometimes like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole   Break up the page into small portions by placing lengthy sections of text on several different pages instead of one page that users have to continuously scroll to view content  Rid the page of low priority content and stick to a single column of wrapped text to prevent horizontal scrolling   Tip 8  Image scaling will make all the difference for mobile users  Look at each image that s used in the content and in the background  Verify that the image scales correctly when users browse in portrait and landscape orientation  If the images don t scale to appropriate dimensions  you should change the CSS rules to tell the images to have widths of 100  or to contain  for background images  themselves in the page   By following these simple tips  you can ensure that your designs are both desktop and mobile friendly so that visitors can have the best possible experience,"[501 252 623 1201 1059 127 450 1196 647 810 571]"
571,training-dataset/product/454.txt,product,Creative ways to increase landing page conversionsLanding pages are like fine works of art  Every detail must have a purpose  In other words  landing pages can t just look good they have to be thoughtful and strategic  This is why testing is crucial  as it provides insight into what s working and what s not   Fortunately  improving conversion rates is within reach  Once the foundation of your landing page is secure  test every detail  When you discover areas that require attention  make the proper adjustments and retest for performance   Anatomy of a great landing page  Before we discuss creative ways to increase conversions  let s cover the fundamental elements that every great landing page should possess  As we focus on creating new and deeper experiences for users  we sometimes forget the principles of good design  Convention is just as important as cleverness   Assess your landing pages to ensure they contain the following elements  If any of these details are missing  make the proper adjustments  A new CTA or optimized image can have a significant impact on how long visitors stay on a page   Clear call to action  Compelling copy  Eye catching headlines  Trust signals  Relevant images  Clickable share buttons  Mobile friendliness  Limited exit pages  Sense of urgency  From good to effective  How to increase conversions  In the next section  we ll explore some of the ways to increase landing page conversions  At SEMGeeks  we feel that these practices can make all the difference in creating meaningful experiences for users  The key is to adjust these ideas to appeal to your unique audience   Include a video to increase engagement  Including video on your landing page can increase conversions by 80   opens PDF   Use video whenever possible  It serves as an engagement medium that doesn t demand much work on the user s part  Video also gives your brand the opportunity to share your story and build relationships through trust signals   Video s ability to improve conversions is understandable  People stay around to watch videos  lowering bounce rates and giving them more time for the brand to sink in  Including key people from your company in the video facilitates trust  Let s also not forget that people prefer video because it s faster  simpler  and more gratifying than reading   As you fight to grab a visitor s attention  take things a step further with an interactive video  Choose your adventure scenarios are wildly popular and allow people to change the outcome based on the choices they make  This level of interactivity increases engagement  reduces bounce rates  and forms positive associations between brands and customers   Capture attention above the fold  Web users  attention spans are shrinking  You only have a moment to draw in a visitor  Capture important information above the fold so visitors don t have to scroll through the page  Try including the form field above the fold as well  This way  users can convert immediately   Remember  web visitors scan  They skim  Keep your content simple and to the point  Avoid long paragraphs and even complete sentences that aren t necessary  Format key information in bullet point or short lists  Spend time crafting a headline  since it ll be the first thing the visitor reads and it ll help them decide if they want to stay on the page   Follow the pyramid structure when creating copy for your landing page  Key points and conclusions come first  with supporting information included further down   The best landing pages create deep experiences for users  Interactivity makes this possible   People make split second decisions based on the information they re provided  Interactive content is an effective way to influence the buyer s journey  Examples of interactive content include quizzes  games  contests  and interactive ebooks and infographics   With the distinct benefits of interactive content  brands from all industries are experimenting with it  For example  a company that sells cars has an interactive page that allows shoppers to change the color and interior of the vehicles  A small boutique store selling clothes and accessories has a landing page with a model whose clothes  shoes  and accessories can be changed   In the end  interactive content demands attention  It forces the user to do something and be alert  This is what drives an emotional connection between the user and the content   Offer multiple ways to convert  Each landing page should have one clear goal  But there can be multiple ways to achieve this goal  In fact  by giving visitors a range of conversion methods  you increase the chance that they will follow through with the desired action  After all  a person may be interested in what you have to offer but not ready to download a free trial or receive emails from you every week   Give prospects choices if you feel that it will personalize their experience  If your company works with individuals and businesses  offer two CTA buttons one for the individual and one for the businesses  If your offer is a free trial  present the user with 2 or 3 different trial packages  People are more likely to convert when they feel an offer closely matches their needs   Design with mobile in mind  With the rise in mobile  more people are completing lead forms on their devices  Yet many companies continue to build landing pages for desktops and assume that users will be completing the form here  Give attention to your mobile audience and how the lead form will look to them   Start with your analytics program to discover the types of devices your audience is using  If you use Google Analytics  find this information under the Audience tab  Keep in mind that even if most users are coming from mobile  they are still viewing your page in different ways  Turning their phones to the horizontal position cuts out half the information  for example  Plus different devices have different screen resolutions   Though there s no way to determine how people are actually viewing your landing pages  you can find out the most popular resolutions  After that  test your pages with the various resolutions to see what information is showing up above the fold   Start with one landing page  Don t overwhelm yourself by creating multiple landing pages at once  Start with one and work your way forward  Once you get a solid foundation in place  you may build new pages   It s not advisable to constantly change things on your landing pages  but you should keep up with the latest trends  New ideas and ways of doing things are always being developed  and you don t want your landing pages to grow old  For now  focus your efforts and resources on the creation of one data driven landing page that works   High converting landing pages are an extension of your business  They keep things running when you re not there to do it  If your landing pages aren t bringing in the conversions you expected  try the suggestions mentioned above   When you find a foundation that drives results  you can create additional landing pages that convert   Read more about increasing

594,training-dataset/product/861.txt,product,The Explosion of Pok mon Go  A Product Designer s Perspective204 Flares 204 Flares    The internet and Wall Street are buzzing about the success of Pok mon Go  Nintendo s first high profile foray into mobile gaming  Nintendo s market cap has grown by over  10 billion  as its shares surged 50  since its launch July 7th  It took five hours from launch to reach the top downloaded spot in the iPhone app store and now has more active Android users than Twitter   So far  analyses of its success have focused on the popularity of the Pok mon brand  but that s really only one piece of the puzzle  As a product manager and design researcher  I went out into the streets to better understand people s behaviour   both physical and digital   to find out what caused millions of people to start training Pok mon  I picked up a CP 187 Magnemite  and now know what that means   as well as a few lessons that can apply to anyone designing digital experiences   Many people I talked to mentioned nostalgia and excitement about revisiting a childhood pleasure  But looking out into the neighborhood  it was clear this wasn t the only thing causing people to try and catch them all  Nintendo s deep expertise in game design shines through  The game is well balanced  with an endorphin stimulating combination of randomness  delayed gratification  and scarcity  You don t need to spend money to enjoy it  though the premium items add enough value that you spend the game itching to spend your Pok  coins at the store   There are many other games that have capitalised on strong game mechanics and a good brand  But Pok mon Go ventures beyond that  capitalising on the mobile platform  making game play physically apparent  and creating a way for people to socialise while playing  These three design choices are important lessons for all of us navigating the digital world   A Mobile Game Designed to Be Mobile  The game only works when you move around and go places  a feature totally unique to the mobile platform  You explore the physical area around you to find Pok mon and items as well as hatch eggs  One of the most interesting elements is Pok  stops  which are local landmarks that give you items and potions  As one gamer explained to me   It s TripAdvisor meets Fitbit with a game attached   what s not to like   Another player mentioned that his brother had no idea he lived in a neighborhood that played a significant part in the history of the gay rights movement   until he went to a Pok  Stop and read the plaque  You can t play from your living room  and unlike the majority of mobile games out there  Candy Crush  Clash of Clans  etc   the experience could never be replicated on your TV or computer   This walking oriented experience incentivises people to change their behaviour quite quickly  One gamer told me that he was playing the game and realised that he had walked about six miles by the end of the day  Usually he watches TV to relax  but instead went out of the house after work  A sales clerk at AT T told me that he s started taking the bus because he loses GPS signal on the train  and gets off a stop or two early in order to get a few more steps to help him hatch his next egg  By using the unique elements of a mobile device  Nintendo is truly changing people s behaviour and adding to the experience   Visible Use  Walking through the park on Sunday  it was blindingly clear who was searching for Pikachu  who was scrolling through Facebook or Twitter  and who was texting  The mechanics of gameplay are such that yourbody language changes when you play  which has both pros and cons  There have been reports of robbers targeting players  injuries  and one second hand account of a person who had pulled her car to the side of the road to catch a rare creature   only to be dinged by a passing car  Google Glass brought on the  Glassholes  phenomenon and a whole host of stereotypes   Pokemorons  are almost as easy to identify  despite not wearing any hardware to signal their participation   The visible use contrasts sharply with my train ride into work where everyone has their heads down  each existing in their own little worlds on small screens  From an engagement standpoint  it also helps to see others playing   it s a good visual cue that you should check your phone and see if there s anything of interest in the neighborhood  This visibility allows real world players to identify each other  which leads into the third key difference  Easily and Naturally Social  I saw two men sitting on a bench playing by a fountain and watched as a woman approached them to ask if they had been able to catch the Ghastly that had just popped up in the area  One pair of friends told me that they looked up and made eye contact with others who were playing in the same area  and the entire group broke out in grins and laughter to think they could all tell what the others were doing  The majority of people I saw playing in the park on Sunday were in groups of two or three   hunting together  I talked to one person who had never played a Pok mon game before  but wanted to know what all his friends were talking about  He ended up playing with his girlfriend as an activity  and he explained   It was like going on a walk  A great date activity   I came across a group of friends out playing together  who said that they usually socialise on the weekends anyway  but normally would be at home drinking in the garden  This week  they stopped by the fountain in the park for a few minutes  and then wandered to the next stop to see what they might catch next   It s an interesting manifestation of what Sherry Turkle termed  Alone Together  in her book of the same name  Technology can allow us to have individual existences while simultaneously helping bring communities more together  The Facebook event  Boston Poke Walk  has nearly 10 000 people interested in attending  and 2 500 confirmed   the organiser had to change the plans for the event in order to avoid police having to shut the event down as an organised  unregistered gathering  People want to play this game together  despite the fact that they haven t  yet  developed any real time player to player interactions   What about Augmented Reality   I deliberately didn t mention the augmented reality  AR  experience as one of the three main lessons from Pok mon Go  When you try to capture a Pok mon  it appears on your screen superimposed on a video from your camera  with the real time world going by  The result has been a number of great photos of Pok mon  hanging out  in the real world and a lot of discussion about how AR will continue to be an important part of future games  My research indicates that the AR component draws people to try the game out if they aren t familiar with the Pok mon franchise it is very effective for attracting new users  But talk to people who have been playing the game for a few hours and the novelty of the AR fades away  while the other elements of gameplay step into focus  In order for AR to be a critical element of gameplay rather than a flashy feature  it needs to be developed further   Dystopias such as Ready Player One and WALL E portray technology as leading us to a life of indolence  obesity  and isolation  Pok mon Go presents us with a plausible alternative future  where technology enables us to better explore the world around us  increasing our interaction with familiar faces as well as strangers  Whether the game itself is just a passing fad or if it will have staying power is still to be determined  but whatever the case  this game will go down in history as moving the genre of mobile applications forward into a new era,"[594 217 472 1069 860 623 135 1166

623,training-dataset/business/1446.txt,business,The New  Must Haves  for Mobile Apps to Succeed TodayNot terribly long ago  headlines predicted that Facebook would die because it couldn t figure out mobile  Of course  we all know the ending to that story  The company invested a ton in making the switch and survived  But it wasn t without serious struggle  Ultimately  it required much more than a shift in technology   the whole culture of the company had to change  Everyone had to understand what users truly wanted from mobile and the steep costs of screwing up   In the words of SC Moatti  former Facebook product leader  founder of Products That Count and author of the new book  Mobilized  An Insider s Guide to the Business and Future of Connected Technology   Mobile has an entirely different resonance and cadence for users  which makes the development of mobile apps fundamentally different too    If she s learned one thing in her 12 years building products for mobile at companies like Trulia and Nokia  it s that people treat their phones as an extension of themselves and their capabilities  Mobile is deeply personal  On one hand  phones can leverage identity data and context like location to deliver remarkable  textured experiences  On the other  it s painfully easy to violate trust   In this exclusive interview  Moatti speaks from a wealth of experience   including running cross platform notifications at Facebook  She provides the most critical lessons for creating mobile products that not only capture people s fascination  but hold it long enough to become a part of their daily lives   MOBILE S HOLY TRINITY   When you re trying to become your best self  you think about your body  mind  and spirit   there s a similar trinity when it comes to mobile development   says Moatti   You want to look good   mobile products have to look good  You want to have a meaningful life   mobile products need to be meaningful and personalized for users  You want to keep growing and learning   mobile products have to change and grow with the people who use them too    People bring their devices with them everywhere  and no matter where we are or who we are  we expect them to work flawlessly  In short  we expect magic from mobile  This is a big part of what made the shift from web so challenging for Facebook  As a free web service  the cost of a mistake for the company had traditionally been rather low  So low that  move fast and break things  was a motto that made sense for a long time  Whenever something went wrong  a few engineers would team up to fix it   no harm  no foul  But this isn t how mobile operates   When a mobile application oversteps or breaks or isn t intuitive  the cost is very high    From a tech perspective  a lot of problems take a long time and more people to fix   she says   Native apps are not nearly as flexible and fixable as web sites  From a user perspective  because people are more emotional about their phones  you can break trust  you can turn people off  and they don t come back as easily   or ever  If the cost of an error on web is 1X  the cost of a similar error on mobile is 10X    When Facebook made the move to mobile  it had to ditch its  break a few eggs to make an omelette  mentality  a big change in the company s core values  But it was worth it in the end  Now well over 90  of Facebook s traffic comes through handheld devices  What follows are the key lessons they learned along the way  and that Moatti has seen repeat again and again at companies striving to do the same   RETHINK YOUR FUNNEL  Digital discovery is critical and terrifying  There s a lot of pressure to maximize the number of people who can find your product   i e  if you don t nail this out of the gate  you re already sunk  It comes down to 3 steps   Set a clear goal  Whether you want to get downloads  impressions  or sign ups  pick just one metric goal to track and optimize toward   Place that goal at the bottom of your funnel  Work backward to determine what has to happen each step of the way to get users to that destination   Optimize the conversion rate of that funnel  Lots has been written about the topic by growth hackers and lean startup consultants  but that doesn t mean there s no new ground to break   Sounds good  but Moatti says that this very systematic approach eventually yields diminishing returns  You may be able to improve your goal by 20   which is already an amazing accomplishment  but on mobile  you need more if you re really going to be successful  because the ecosystem is so complex    There are two tools you definitely should use to take back control and better navigate the discovery process  shortcuts and hooks   says Moatti   Shortcuts reduce the time and effort it takes for users to get to your goal  Hooks get as many people into your funnel as possible    Shortcuts  Effectively  shortcuts make your funnel less deep  by cutting out some steps  Take Amazon for instance  When you buy a book  it immediately shows you other books people who bought that book purchased  You don t need to go back and search for other books by the same author  or other books on the same topic  The list is right there in front of you  That s an example of a shortcut   Hooks  Hooks broaden the top of your funnel  Zillow is the perfect case study here  On average  people buy or sell a home every five years  Given that rate  it wouldn t make sense to only market to people who have identified as home buyers or sellers  That audience would be a tiny moving target  Instead  Zillow redefined its addressable market with its  Zestimates   an estimated value of a home  which is a general curiosity for most people   who doesn t want to know the value of the home they live in  or the one their boss lives in  It was the hook that got millions to engage with Zillow repeatedly   You need to psychologize your audience to devise the proper hook  Moatti advises starting with this question  How can I make my service interesting and fun for everyone  What data can I expose that would be addictive for people to know and share  Basically  what do they not know yet  that ideally is of popular interest and regularly changes  For Zillow  that was housing prices  Find and test your hook to maximize your app s discovery   DEMONSTRATE YOUR VALUE  IMMEDIATELY  Your onboarding process should be defined by one theme  Showing users exactly how valuable your product will be for them  What s important for them to know to recognize this value  Put it front and center   For instance  new Facebook users  yes  there are still many   are not immediately thrown into a newsfeed or asked to create a profile  The one thing they re asked to do is connect with their friends who are already on the site  From the first moment  it s clear that people you know are already using the product   which is pretty compelling    Everything you see encourages you to connect with friends  until you reach the magic threshold of 20 connections   says Moatti   That onboarding threshold is basically the line at which the product gets cool and relevant enough for people to see the value and stick with it  If you have 20  friends  you get a great  full experience    You should know what your product s onboarding threshold is  At what point  and after what actions  does your product become sticky  Why   Pandora is another example  Given all the music services out there  its challenge is to demonstrate its unique value proposition quickly  So its onboarding flow has to pull double duty   both teaching people how to use the app and showing off what it does best  Accordingly  Pandora s onboarding threshold asks users to create their own station so they can experience the power of its recommendation engine   DON T SHOW TOO MUCH  DON T ASK TOO MUCH  One of the biggest mistakes Moatti sees is apps trying to cram too much into their onboarding flows   I get it  you re passionate about the service you re creating  so you want to tell people all about it  But no  you really have to restrain yourself    It s vital that you get new users to focus on one task at a time   Helping your users focus on what to do next is value you re providing  Think of it that way   Next to your app straight out crashing  the ultimate kiss of death   an overly complicated welcome process is the biggest turn off    People don t want to hear about your service  they want to see why it s useful for them   she says   When I used to run the rental division for Trulia  we made sure the app showed rental listings immediately   as soon as someone opened the app  They were immediately reassured that they d find what they were looking for and that we wouldn t waste their time    Before asking them for any personal information  the app would very organically allow users to set criteria around the type of rentals they were looking for   whether they wanted a two bedroom  or parking  or something for less than  3 000 etc    Instead of asking people directly to sign up  demonstrate to them why they should   Moatti says   Once a user had specified their criteria  the app would ask them if they wanted to save their search so they could pick up where they left off later  and if they wanted to receive notifications of new listings that matched their preferences  Only if they said yes did the app prompt them to enter their email  And at that point  it seemed like a good exchange for something concrete    Crossing that big threshold where users give you their contact information becomes a lot easier when they perceive they ve already gotten value from your service   Moatti says   This is where the initial onboarding flow ended for many users  But when they came back  triggered by a notification of new listings  for instance  the app led them to engage even more deeply   again by focusing on the next logical  single task    When users came back to look at a rental  we d ask them if they wanted to apply  And if they said yes  we immediately showed them other rentals that also met their criteria   she says   When Trulia first started doing this  they noticed that many users would go on to apply for multiple related rentals they were shown  This made sense   renters are usually hoping to get selected instead of being overly selective themselves  So Moatti and her team took the app one step further   We decided not to ask them if they were interested in other rentals  we just went ahead and applied for them on their behalf    This was a pretty risky move  but after the change was made  they saw a spike in their net promoter score   When you think about it  renting is a pretty painful experience  No one wants to apply 25 times for 25 different places they know they re likely not to hear back from   she says   When we applied for them  we increased the likelihood they d hear back from someone  and they ended up being much more satisfied with the Trulia app    You should be looking for and testing out such shortcuts all the time  according to Moatti   By sending notifications and automatically surfacing only the listings that met user criteria  Trulia drastically cut down the amount of searching users would need to do to find what they wanted   We really evaluated all the actions we wanted users to take and got serious about cutting out as much as we could   she says   As a result  they knew we d only show them content that interested them  and we d make life easier in surprising ways    KNOW WHEN TO ASK PERMISSION  One of the top questions Moatti fields from app makers is when they should be asking permission to send push notifications  access a phone s camera or contacts  and more  There s a lot of data pointing to the right way to do this    Strive to ask permission either as early or as late as possible   she says  citing WhatsApp as a prime example   The beauty of WhatsApp is that you can message with your friends instantly  So it s critical for it to send push notifications whenever someone messages you  That s why it asks for push permission as early as possible  even before signup  If you say no  the app actually says something like   Sorry  you can t use WhatsApp because push is so critical to the experience     At the same time  WhatsApp waits as late as possible   until you want to send a picture   to ask for access to your camera roll   If they asked upfront when I first started using the app  I might be confused  it might give me pause  I might be overwhelmed  If I want to send a picture  then I have more understanding and high intent to agree with an ask  so that s the perfect time to request permission    Moatti recommends making a comprehensive list of all the permissions you might possibly need for your app to deliver a full experience  Think about all your capabilities based on platform  Android  iOS  watches  iPads  etc  all have different abilities you can bake into your product  You want to make sure you re being thoughtful about all of them   Turn your list into a matrix where you mark whether you want to ask that particular permission as early as possible or as late as possible or not at all  For example  you might want to access their location data as early as possible  but their iOS health data as late as possible  Cross out the permissions you don t need  You end up with a game plan   But don t stop there   You should always be A B testing the right moments to ask for critical permissions   says Moatti   At Facebook  we experimented with asking to send push notifications before log in and then immediately after login  You ll uncover opportunities to optimize   On top of that software updates come with changes to permissions  so you ll want to revisit this regularly   SC Moatti at a recent book signing   BUILD IT BEAUTIFUL  Design plays a major role in whether a mobile strategy succeeds or not  People have much higher expectations for the look and feel of mobile products than they do for their web based counterparts  This might be because devices themselves are sleek and high design  It might be because Apple in particular has placed such a premium of beautiful experiences  Regardless  the bar has been raised  and mobile products that look dated  unpolished  or clunky are at a drastic disadvantage   In technology  beauty isn t so much about pretty pictures and more about efficiency  Nothing is wasted  and that s beautiful    You might be building for a phone or a watch or glasses   it doesn t really matter   as long as you ve devised the most efficient experience for that platform  There should be no extra functions or buttons or text  You don t have a lot of real estate and you can t let people get distracted  You need to lead them along one clear path through your app    This explains why ads aren t nearly as effective on mobile and why the business model needs to be different  she says   You see subscription models working much better on mobile  If you want to run ads  they have to be sophisticated and organic  The cost of doing this wrong is way too high  People will see one ad and decide never to use your product again    Heed the  Thumb Test     Imaging that your user is on their phone  waiting for the bus  surrounded by distractions and your app has to hold their attention   says Moatti   It s very important that they be able to use your product using an average thumb  If they can t  you fail the Thumb Test  and will lose users    She sees so many mobile products where buttons are either too small  or placed too close together  or links are confusing  or new unwanted windows pop up   As soon as you reroute someone to a screen they didn t want or expect  they ll lift their head up and you ve lost   she says   Someone should be able to complete all critical actions quickly without ever losing focus    MINIMIZE UNPREDICTABILITY  With mobile apps  surprises are very rarely a good thing   When a user is suddenly presented with a screen  a choice  an action that doesn t seem logical or intuitive to them  there s a high chance they ll bounce and never be seen again  You want to rigorously remove any experience that could feel this way   Your navigation  in particular  can either make your app clear and pleasant to use  or be a huge source of confusion   If you look at solid apps out there  their navigation is singular and clear   says Moatti   Facebook  for example  has the five primary options across the bottom of the app  There are a limited number of ways to go  and this constraint is comforting    Too many companies try to offer too many features  she says  As a result  they end up with multiple navigation elements  They might have the few choices in the bar at the bottom  but also a hamburger menu in the top corner brimming with even more choices   My recommendation is to have a single navigation system in only one place in your app   she says   Pick the one that works best for you whether it s a hamburger  or a bottom bar  It can be whatever fits your style as long as it restricts users to the core choices that make your product great    Gestures are another area ripe for unpredictability  Many app makers get too creative with the gestures they require  and it only makes user experience worse   Right now  we re at a point with mobile where you should never be coming up with new gestures for users   Moatti says   Still  I hear developers say all the time   Instagram introduced the double tap  Tinder made swiping a thing   But we ve gone too far   Now there s a standard lexicon of gestures you should draw from to make your app accessible   Recently  she saw an app ask for a corkscrew gesture to zoom in and out  Even though it illustrated what to do  it was very unintuitive   It ruined the entire thing for me  even though it was one small part of the app  it made me question the construction of the product as a whole    This extends to making sure gestures produce the expected response within your product  If you re asking people to swipe  then that action should move elements one way or the other  If you re asking people to tap on an image  that should probably take you to a screen with more details  Invest the time to think about what people expect from the actions you want them to take in your product  As often as possible  you want them to get exactly what they expect   IT COMES DOWN TO CULTURE  There s a reason Facebook had to dramatically alter its mindset to become a great mobile company  More important than having the talent to build something smart and high quality  it needed this talent to have the time  space and inclination to think through these challenges  After all  Facebook was instrumental in defining the gestures  look and feel  and expectations people now have across the board for mobile experiences   Each of the lessons above boils down to being mindful about users  goals  how human attention naturally travels through an experience  how to present clear and logical choices  and how to make a service feel incredibly personal without overstepping   Beyond that  each of these areas requires constant  methodical experimentation  None of this is possible without refactoring your culture to invest in and prioritize these behaviors   many of which are not immediately productive   Connected devices have forever changed tech s  move fast and break things mentality   Moatti says  When you re designing a product to extend a person s identity and capabilities in the world the way that mobile does  it s better to move slow and deliver delight,"[623 450 1318 127 1321 1201 840 411 252 647 217]"
647,training-dataset/product/268.txt,product,Is Your App Idea Really an App In this guest blog post  Designli CEO Co Founder and friend of the Founder Institute Keith Shields outlines the concerns founders must consider before diving into building an app   It s a big decision to go from a basic responsive website to a native app  On one hand  mobile responsive websites are quicker and easier   and  thus  cheaper   to build  On the other hand  a native app can be a boon to your business growth  Not every idea needs a native app  but it s difficult for startup owners to identify when it s time to make the leap  As custom software developers that spend our time building both mobile responsive websites and native mobile apps at Designli  we thought we d take the time to lay out some clear  actionable differences in this article  Here are some differences and benefits to take into consideration when you re looking to make the call   So  What s the Difference   Unless you re technically savvy  you probably think any app that displays on a mobile device is the same  They look the same  show similar content  and you don t need to add extra overhead to your development costs if you stick with a responsive web app  It s true that there are many cost efficient reasons to stick with web applications  They are relatively easy to maintain and don t cost a lot to build   Cost efficiency isn t always a good reason to stick with web applications  and in many ways they can limit your growth  Your other option  A native app  Native applications are those that run directly on the mobile device rather than the device s internal browser   Most of the differences are technical  but there are some clear marketing and sales potential benefits from a native app  You do need to maintain a different code based than your web app  which will require some additional overhead  but the sales potential negates this investment as your customers are able to have your branded logo directly on their tablets or smartphones  Native apps aren t going anywhere  with app revenue expected to top  100 billion by 2020  It also eliminates much of the data connection requirements that are needed with a web application   Responsive web apps are compatible with any mobile device that has a browser  which is nearly all of them in today s smartphone laden world  You don t need to consider operating system aside from basic browser differences  Native apps  on the other hand  must be built specifically for the target platform  Developers can build apps that target both Android and iOS  but remember that they are both uploaded and built for their respective operating systems and thus require essentially being built two separate times from the ground up   Overall  a native mobile app is more to maintain  but it s also more potential and earnings for the business  These apps can help your business scale online and improve growth potential  but you also need to know when it s time  When do you make the leap from mobile responsive website to a more expensive but fine tuned mobile app  Here are three specific considerations   You Need Granular Location Information  Let s say you have a website that caters to different locations around the globe  You need the user s location to customize the platform s language  location specific verbiage  and give users options based on their current GPS coordinates  You can t get precise data from a website   at least not quite yet on all mobile operating systems  that is  you only get location information based on IP addresses  which can be hundreds of miles from the user s GPS data   With a native app  you can get GPS coordinates of the user s location  which allows you to customize your app even when the user is traveling  If precise geolocation data is an issue for you  it s time to convert your web application to a native mobile app   You Want to Notify Users Immediately Without Using Email  Push notifications are one of the biggest benefits of native applications  Push notifications are those messages you see on your smartphone or tablet specific to an application you ve installed on your device  The user must give the application permission to send push notifications  but most users willingly allow them   For instance  suppose you offer sales at different times of the day based on location  You can use the GPS location you get from the previous section s benefit in order to send push notifications to the mobile device based on the user s time zone  Some clever app owners even send push notifications to mobile devices when the user is close to their business location  These advantages can t be used with a basic web application   Another example is found in gaming apps  Most of them notify users when they reach a certain state in the game  think  your Clash of Clans village is being raided    These notifications have been shown to keep users coming back for more  They keep interest in the app  and they engage users more than allowing the app to sit stale on the device   These are just a few examples of the benefits of push notifications  If you stick to a mobile responsive website  you are limited to simple email notifications that aren t quite as effective  You have spam filters to fight  non working emails  and complaints from people who no longer want your emails  With push notifications  you have direct access to messages that display on the device  and the user can remove access if they no longer want them   Cross Platform Concerns  Several platforms allow developers to build apps that work cross platform  PhoneGap and Sencha Touch are just two examples  Your developer can use one of these solutions to ensure that the app is compatible with the two major mobile platforms  Android and iOS   When you choose a development team  they might prefer to use these cross platform tools  They have their advantages such as speeding up development time  providing one source for your app s code base  i e  build it once  deploy it in two stores   and they are easier to use when the team wants to present multi platform prototypes to you   These tools have their limitations  however  They can create sluggish code and you re limited to the same interface across platforms  Each platform has its own distinguishable characteristics  and they should be taken into consideration when you think through your app s design   So  Is It Time   If you need a simple solution  a responsive website is probably enough but eventually it s prudent to review your application needs  marketing and sales potential and consider a native app  Native apps give you several benefits that web apps just can t offer   When you need better visitor options  better details of your users  demographics  and you need to customize text and images based on this information  you should consider an investment into native mobile apps  Ask your team or your chosen software development company for advice  as those who live in this world day to day are best equipped to determine which platforms would be best for your particular product   Creatively Bold  Humbly Priced  Designli

648,training-dataset/business/1274.txt,business,A Tale of 2 API Platforms   GGV Capital   MediumA Tale of 2 API Platforms  Opening up an API is a big commitment  one that needs to be managed well over time in order to ensure a healthy and thriving ecosystem  If a company is still in the throes of developing a product strategy and business model  it s worth waiting to offer a highly accessible  external API  It s better to understand first where you re going as a company  and then enable a massive network of partnerships to accelerate your product in that direction  with complementary experiences  If your company is thinking about offering a public API  this post is for your consideration  Let s take a look at Twitter and Slack to illustrate the ways this can play out   The Twitter API   Ecosystem Misalignment  In the summer of 2012  Twitter made significant changes to their API  sunsetting version 1 and introducing 1 1  with limited access and a host of new usage policies  Of all the changes to the API  the most controversial was Twitter limiting how many users a third party client app could have  This ensured that these client apps  which largely replicated the core Twitter experience  could not grow too big and thus  not competitive  Prior to this  Twitter s API offered largely unfettered access with little applied policy  Early on  Twitter was extremely busy just trying to maintain the service   remember the fail whale  When the API was published  the only first party Twitter client was the website  The API enabled an incredible flood of mobile third party clients spanning all major mobile platforms of the day  iOS  Android  Blackberry  and so on   The early days were magical  with apps such as Tweetbot  Twitterlator  Twitterific  UberTwitter  Seesmic  Brizzly  Falcon  and many others driving meaningful feature development  At this time  the API already had 900k apps registered from 600k developers  and it was processing an insane 13 billion requests a day  The  Twitterverse  was massive  It was undoubtedly one of the most exciting APIs to build with in recent memory   However  as Twitter increasingly felt that their most scalable business model would be advertising  it became crucial that Twitter own the direct UI relationship with users  This became particularly pronounced when Twitter purchased Tweetie  the iOS client  and in that moment this new first party app suddenly became indistinguishable from the service itself  Additionally  for every great client out there  there were many poorly made clients with bad user experiences  This was toxic for users trying the service for the first time  causing high churn and further forcing Twitter to offer a first party mobile app   But most important  it was around this time that a bomb went off in the ecosystem  Bill Gross  company UberMedia began buying up several third party Twitter clients  Echofon  UberTwitter  Twidroyd  and was looking to buy Tweetdeck  Had UberMedia successfully bought Tweetdeck  they d have controlled a significant base of clients  dictating how many users would create and consume Tweets  There was an acute awareness within Twitter of what an existential threat this posed   if UberMedia created a shadow network  siphoned off users  and dropped Twitter out of the equation entirely  it would have been disastrous   In a sense  this meant that all of the consumer facing third party clients and aggregation apps were suddenly competitive   leading to misaligned incentives  and a major tightening of policies  Below is the infamous  API quadrant   illustrating where it was and wasn t safe to play   This was largely the end of Twitter s API  golden age   An API is a contract with external developers  and once it s out there taking it away is like trying to put toothpaste back in the tube  it s hard  Are there other ways this v1 1 transition could have been managed  like continued unfettered access without user limits but with an ad syndication model for third party clients  Yes  absolutely   but that s for another post  Even though only a small subset of developers was actually affected by the v1 1 changes  remember  the ecosystem was huge and there were many different classes of apps   the impact of v1 1 sent shockwaves through the developer community and resulted in an erosion of trust  paramount to a flourishing platform   Slack s API   Aligned Incentives  Contrast Twitter s approach with the way Slack manages their API ecosystem  Slack has deliberately aligned incentives with their ecosystem  focusing on complimentary apps that are weaved into their service  For instance  some of the top apps on Slack s API cover functions such as project management  calendar control  expense accounting  and more  These Slack apps that utilize a subset of scopes   permissions  via OAuth  are featured in an app directory after a review is conducted  This directory helps increase discoverability and distribution  crucial to removing friction and providing apps with the user liquidity they need to thrive   These third party apps enrich the core Slack experience in complementary ways  This is good for all participants  users get a better experience  developers acquire more users  and Slack gets far more functionality than it could have developed in house  The incentives are aligned  Slack is taking a proactive approach to guiding and managing their ecosystem  Despite the dangers of publishing a roadmap that s certain to change  Slack has done so in the spirit of setting expectations  Furthermore  they ve provisioned an  Ideaboard  to relay market feedback they get from customers  giving developers a sense of the problems that customers need solved   Perhaps most impressive  Slack assembled an  80M fund to directly invest in third party apps  This is putting money where Slack s mouth is  provisioning capital to the developer community and allowing them to sustain operations while they build a business  Slack has invested almost  2M into 14 apps  with a particular focus on bot style apps  This is a fantastic approach to ensuring that the best apps are rewarded and encouraged to maintain a high quality experience   Managing an Ecosystem  So we return to a common question many companies face today  whether they should open an API to become a data service or platform  Opening an API is a huge commitment  and it s easy to underestimate the amount of work that goes along with enabling a healthy ecosystem  To be entirely fair to Twitter the API was launched incredibly early  well before the business model was figured out and obviously before there was an existential threat of client consolidation by a single external player  This made it extremely difficult for the company to continue pursuing a wide open API and spin up a healthy ad business in parallel  Remember that there are huge expectations of a company in its hyper growth stages  in particular on when said company is going to make a lot of money  It s important to note here too  that the third party developers who built clients in the early days benefited greatly  they got users of their own  a subset of Twitter users   positive social regard in the developer community  and many of them made varying amounts of money  some of them made a lot of money    Healthy APIs should drive reciprocal benefits to the provider  third party app developers  and users  If your company is going to offer an API and you want to facilitate a strong ecosystem  you must invest heavily  You must constantly be working to set your developer community up for success  It s not enough to just publish the API and hope things works out  It requires a lot of forethought to properly orchestrate the right set of incentives  access  and policies for developers  Think through the types of experiences that you want your ecosystem to enable  and which experiences you want to directly own   then build out the APIs to enable such functionality  Configure your APIs  documentation  and policies to guide developers higher up the value chain  And make your core product experience great  so that there s not demand for alternative core experiences   Conversely  don t offer APIs for functionality that you must own in house  If you offer an API that powers the core facets of your product  then you re effectively guiding your developer base to build the same service or some close derivative thereof  imagine if Twitter had never publicly offered the home timeline API  Lastly  when you find those keystone integrations in the ecosystem that illustrate watermark use cases you d like to see tackled by the developer community   bang the drum for these apps  Let the ecosystem know this is the level of quality all other apps should aspire to  Demonstrate how you take care of players who hit this watermark with increased distribution  co marketing opportunities  increased API access  and more  At the end of the day  if there s trust  clear lines of communication  well set expectations  and reciprocal benefit being driven across all participants in a platform   an incredible ecosystem can flourish

744,training-dataset/product/731.txt,product,The ethics of digital designWithin five years  80  of adults will own a smartphone  Never before has the world embraced a technology so quickly  Digital designers now have a medium that can reach not just local markets but an instant global audience  Tech companies already boast userbases of hundreds of millions  even billions  virtual populations in their own right   Although these millions usually spend longer in their favourite apps than their favourite urban spaces  users have little say in how digital space is made  Mass public consultation is rare  Instead  roadmaps are devised and built according to the strategies of private enterprise  If a user is unhappy with the outcome  their only recourse may be to abandon the service  a significant renunciation in the case of global utilities like Google search or Facebook   It therefore falls to designers and their colleagues at these tech giants to ensure their products are beneficial to the world   Disruption is Silicon Valley s current watchword  Start ups are optimised for shaking up vulnerable industries rather than assessing the resulting social  legal and ethical impact  Progress itself is the yardstick  whether that progress is in a worthwhile direction is sometimes secondary   This attitude is partly to be expected given the infancy of many tech companies  with leadership teams that show talent but lack big game experience  It s also clear that the industry has a big diversity problem  At some Silicon Valley companies  just 1  of engineers are black  Female representation in technical roles often hovers around 20   Growing tech companies have too frequently hired for a  culture fit  mould of 20 something  educated white men  intelligent people  yes  but hardly worldly wise   There s no doubt tech innovation has improved the world in many ways  But the industry s revolutionary mindset  combined with the narrow perspective of a homogeneous workforce  means companies sometimes act with questionable ethics   A 2012 Facebook research study attempted to analyse  emotional contagion  by prioritising happy or unhappy Newsfeed stories  The company did not ask the 689 000 participants for informed consent  relying instead on existing terms of service   and appeared not to have considered the potential effect on users with depression   An FCC inquiry revealed that Google Street View cars secretly collected data from domestic WiFi networks for two years   Transport service Uber has faced multiple lawsuits about its obligations  or otherwise  under the Americans with Disabilities Act  after allegations Uber drivers refused to serve disabled users   We might attribute these issues to na ve oversight  the sort of lapse we d expect from a booming  excitable industry  But sometimes it s harder to advocate leeway   The so called dark pattern is a creeping trend on the web and in apps alike  an interface intended to trick users into disadvantageous behaviour  The double negative obfuscation of marketing checkboxes is a familiar example  but more serious examples abound  Some e commerce sites sneak in additional items to a user s shopping basket without consent  and it s regrettably common for online services to offer a painless setup process but bury cancellation inside a tortuous call centre menu   Regulation is starting to constrain some of the worst offences but  sadly  in an industry changing so quickly  there s ample opportunity for wrongdoing before regulators catch up   The Internet of Things   the coming wave of hyper connectivity that embeds technology into everyday objects   presents a fresh set of ethical challenges  Our public spaces and homes will soon be dotted with connected devices that can listen to our every word  or gather sensitive data about our weight  our sex lives  our possessions  The benefit could be phenomenal   but so is the risk of abuse   Designers as such have a central role in safeguarding digital products so they not only empower but also protect users   This responsibility starts with designers  own output  Design teams should demand high ethical standards from themselves and their colleagues  Internal product development conversations are where key ethical questions are answered  whether intentionally or not  Designers should be active in these conversations  advocating for user needs  identifying areas for deeper research and highlighting ethical concerns even at the risk of short term unpopularity   Designers should also strive to give digital products a healthy balance of seamlessness and interrogability  While it s appealing to create technology that needs little human intervention  this sort of black box can be a breeding ground for dishonest behaviour  High risk systems should be interrogable  so that a sufficiently motivated user can learn about what a system is doing  what data it s gathering and where that data goes  The success of connected technologies is largely predicated on trust   allowing users to lift the bonnet will hopefully make this trust easier to earn   Digital designers are  furthermore  well placed to push for increased team diversity  As ambassadors for global userbases  designers know well the range of mentalities and approaches people bring to technology  Homogenous teams are too easily swept up in camaraderie  seeing only exciting gains for people like them  yet blind to potential harm for people not like them  The broad perspective of diverse teams offers better insight on tough choices  early warning of ethical issues that may disadvantage particular groups   Underpinning everything is a need to communicate  Digital designers should help users understand what s happening inside the products they rely on  Only then can customers make truly informed choices  Designers should also educate lawmakers on the consequences of bad ethical practice and advocate for regulation where appropriate  To this end  our industry has a duty to highlight damaging practice wherever it is found  and to continue to educate the public about misleading or harmful aspects of digital products  Our global audience deserves technology that works in its very best interests   Cennydd Bowles is a digital product designer  recently design manager at Twitter  He is the author of the book

764,training-dataset/business/442.txt,business,THE PLATFORM REVOLUTION  WHY NOW AND WHAT NEXTNote  A variation of this article appeared as an op ed on The Wall Street Journal s MarketWatch  This was co authored with Geoffrey Parker   g2parker  Tulane Univ   and Marshall Van Alstyne   infoecon  Boston Univ    They currently serve as research scientists at the MIT Sloan School of Management   Nokia just sold to Microsoft  Blackberry announced that it was considering putting itself up for sale  Google s Android  meanwhile  grows stronger and is moving beyond smartphones to power cars  home electronics  and wearable accessories  Twitter s heading for a strong IPO with the world s strongest platform for influence and dissemination  While Barnes Noble is parting company with the Nook and struggling to survive  a thriving Amazon and Kindle continue to transform publishing  most recently with the launch of a fan fiction platform  In the hotel industry  Airbnb poses a serious threat to the revenues of established players and is disrupting the housing market   Platform Disruption  We used to live in a world where commerce flowed linearly  Firms added value to products  shipped them out and sold them to consumers  Producers and consumers held very distinct roles  Value was created upstream and flowed downstream   Now  market upstarts are displacing market leaders faster than ever before as entire industries transform  We are in the midst of a seismic shift in business models  powered by the Internet and a generation of connected users   Business leaders  today  develop platforms that connect diverse participants with one another and enable them to interact and transact  On the Internet  anyone can be a producer  Today s network platforms aid the creation of entirely new markets by connecting producers and consumers with each other   Three forces are powering the rise of platforms  ubiquitous network access with ever increasing mobile penetration  reputation systems that enable trust among distributed strangers  and access to low cost shared infrastructure with tools and data to capture and coordinate interactions   Three factors driving disruption  We predict three factors will drive this disruption   Platforms will displace high cost gatekeepers with meritocratic crowds 2 YouTube and eBay flip the gatekeeping process used in media and retail  In lieu of professional editors and buyers  anyone can produce and the market itself decides what the market wants   Platforms will aggregate disconnected players in fragmented industries  OpenTable is rolling up unconnected and unaffiliated restaurants  RedBus  the world s largest bus reservation platform  gathers India s fragmented bus schedules and reshapes the travel landscape   Platforms will unlock new value from spare resources and user generated content 1 Airbnb hosts and RelayRides  cars are the spare rooms and idle rides of thousands of individuals  Much of Facebook s appeal is the newsfeed produced from constant user activity  Instagram s  1 billion sale was a consequence of the work  not of 13 employees  but of more than 30 million contributors   The new rules of a platformed world  Ultimately  this transformation redefines competition  Firms that once sought advantage based on the strength of their internal resources and channel access now face competitors that harness armies of connected users and ecosystems of resources  Apple s App Store  hosting nearly a million applications  offers a compelling testimony to the power of ecosystems  More buyers on eBay attract more sellers  which in turn attracts more buyers  More freelancers on Upwork attract more job postings and vice versa  Such feedback loops enable these businesses to grow into massive juggernauts  Businesses win based on their ability to captivate third parties and connect them to each other through creative interactions   The rise of ecosystems also means that old linear rules no longer work given new platform realities  In operations  just in time inventory gets trumped by just not mine inventory  The IT function transforms from client server support to cloud service solution  In marketing  the profit maximizing price is often at or below zero  Charging every user can destroy network effects  yet data and network effects create critical competitive advantage   Platforms aren t merely a Silicon Valley obsession  Walmart continues to invest in big data and is leading a retail evolution to the store as platform model  Nike  is showing how the shoe can become a connected platform  Car manufacturers are building connected cars  And GE is forging ahead with its smart grid platform   Threats to Platform Innovation  But  for every GE moving forward  there is an incumbent resisting change  often relying on regulators to stave off emerging platforms  Uber s disruption of public transportation has had to contend with many regulatory hurdles  Airbnb has run afoul of housing laws  And Kickstarter crowdfunding has been caught by public securities laws  Since regulation often lags innovation  this can succeed for a time   So what should you do to thrive in a Platformed world   Will you be the disrupter or the disrupted  To act on platform opportunities  consider the three factors transforming industry and embrace them   Remake the role that experts play inside your business to leverage user capabilities outside your business  Build social curation and reputation systems to employ the collective intelligence and judgment of your users   Connect consumers to their best product options  regardless of source  through data driven matchmaking  The firm that builds an OpenTable for consumer finance  considering appetites for risk and reputations of products that deliver on promises  would help buyers make sense of the dizzying array of complex and disconnected products  The value would be enormous   Finally  solve a consumer problem in your industry by marshaling spare resources  If you re in transportation  build systems that employ other people s trucks before expanding your own fleet   Platform opportunities are all around us  Industries like Education  HealthCare  Insurance  and Legal Services  are ripe for disruption  In an increasingly connected future  platforms will only grow in importance  We need to construct the frameworks and rules to allow everyone a fair shot at success in this new world   In 2011  Nokia s CEO Stephen Elop sent out the  Burning Platform  manifesto to his employees  It was too late  the rules had already changed  What happened to Nokia and Blackberry can happen to any business that doesn t leverage the power of platforms  But  for those willing to open their ecosystems and aid their consumers  the future looks bright indeed,"[764 874 402 346 1367 412 1296 1170 55 285 780]"
765,training-dataset/business/197.txt,business,The State of Technology at the End of 2016   Stratechery by Ben ThompsonThis is the third year I have written an article summarizing the state of technology  In 2014 I described the three historical epochs of consumer technology   the PC  the browser  and mobile   and the outline of the fourth  which I suggested was messaging  in 2015 I refined the fourth to be Facebook specifically  it is clearly WeChat in China  and wondered if Slack could form a similar foundation for the enterprise   Each of these epochs laid the ground work for what followed  PCs were where browsers ran  and browsers enabled the build out of cloud services that made mobile so compelling  Then  the omnipresence of mobile devices created the conditions for social media  specifically Facebook  to dominate a staggering amount of attention  What  then  has Facebook wrought   Well  Donald Trump  for one   From Startup to Establishment  For most of its existence Silicon Valley has been synonymous with startups  even during the rise of the PC it was Redmond based Microsoft that became the establishment  The scrappy underdogs were clustered alongside the San Francisco Bay  and disruption was their mantra  And disrupt they have  while the IT era was about making existing companies more efficient  the Internet era has shaken the very foundations on which those companies rest  The media is the starkest example  Google and Facebook didn t create better newspapers  but rather reduced newspapers   and all other forms of media   to just another piece of content no better or worse than cat GIFs or baby pictures jostling for attention in their carefully manicured gardens   The pervasiveness of those gardens   not just Facebook and Google  but Apple and Amazon as well  and Microsoft at work   can at times seem overwhelming  these companies are anything but scrappy startups  and their relative market caps   five of the top eight  and the top five at the end of last quarter    confirm that Silicon Valley is very much the establishment  That establishment  though  is of a far different nature than what came before   Facebook  the Media  and Trump  The dispute about Facebook and fake news is the most obvious example  while previous claims of bias were about sins of commission   editors and journalists fitting the news to their preconceived notions   Facebook and Google both are being accused of a sin of omission  not actively removing purposeful mistruths from their platform  Critics contend that Facebook in particular bears some responsibility for recent election results  that absent  fake news  Donald Trump would not be the president elect   In fact  Facebook is responsible for Trump s election  but not because of fake news  at least not directly  Rather  as I explained in the spring  the devolution of traditional media driven by Facebook s commodification of content was not an isolated event  the power of America s political parties stemmed directly from the fact that media  and its paid advertising model  was the gatekeeper of information  From that piece    Facebook has created  a curious dynamic in politics in particular  there is no one dominant force when it comes to the dispersal of political information  and that includes the parties described in the previous section  Remember  in a Facebook world  information suppliers are modularized and commoditized as most people get their news from their feed  This has two implications  All news sources are competing on an equal footing  those controlled or bought by a party are not inherently privileged  The likelihood any particular message will  break out  is based not on who is propagating said message but on how many users are receptive to hearing it  The power has shifted from the supply side to the demand side This is a big problem for the parties as described in The Party Decides  Remember  in Noel and company s description party actors care more about their policy preferences than they do voter preferences  but in an aggregated world it is voters aka users who decide which issues get traction and which don t  And  by extension  the most successful politicians in an aggregated world are not those who serve the party but rather those who tell voters what they most want to hear   Telling users what they want to hear is  of course  the real reason fake news gains traction  Facebook has monetized confirmation bias with its singular focus on engagement  and while I count that as a lesser evil than active political censorship  the broader point is that everyone and everyone   mainstream media  Macedonian teens  even political parties   are competing on a playing field where by default no one has a louder megaphone than anyone else   The Rise of E Commerce  This leveling of the playing field is not limited to media  I wrote this summer about the rise of Dollar Shave Club which leveraged YouTube  social media marketing  and e commerce to challenge P G s Gillette in the market for U S  razors  It didn t matter that P G had the money to build brand affinity with endless advertising and the leverage with retailers to ensure that Gillette dominated shelf space  virality is free  targeted advertising excels at niches  and when it comes to e commerce  shelf space is effectively infinite   Amazon is seeking to do the same thing for all physical goods  and the potential effects are massive  Just consider Amazon Prime s two headline features   free shipping and Prime Video   and then consider three of the primary industries in the consumer economy  consumer packaged goods companies leverage their size to secure shelf space in big box retailers  both are reached by people driving their cars  These three industries are the largest TV advertisers  and Prime is taking aim at all three  Prime Video and its competitors are increasingly dominating non live television viewing  and there are no commercials  while Amazon Prime obviates the need to visit retailers  and its infinite shelf space means niche products are much more viable   This transformation echoes the impact of Facebook on the media  a dramatic leveling of the playing field  The advantages of scale that guaranteed success in the post war era just don t matter very much when advertising is cheap  shelf space is infinite  and shipping is free  And  just as Facebook s breakdown of the media broke down the political parties  Amazon s break down of physical retail will have its own knock on effects  carrying household supplies is a major reason to own a car  for example  which means Amazon is a laying the foundation for a service like Uber to shift from being a car supplement to a full on substitute   New Opportunities  There is a certain symmetry to Dollar Shave Club and Donald Trump  both began by targeting niches and leveraging social media  but more importantly  the companies and institutions most invested in stopping them found themselves powerless to do so because their point of leverage had been circumvented by the Internet  That certainly ought to strike fear into the heart of any executive or politician whose institution is predicated on the old world order  but it is also an unprecedented opportunity to build something new   To that end the most exciting companies in technology are those enabling just that  new companies for a new world without gatekeepers  Companies like Square  making it easy to accept payments offline  and Stripe doing the same online  both are expanding into adjacent services that make it easier to get a business off the ground  It has been encouraging to see Zenefits get its act together  the HR company and its competitors make it far easier and cheaper to grow a new business  And today s giants play a role as well  AWS has made it dramatically cheaper to start any sort of company with an Internet component  and Amazon com s marketplace model means small companies can leverage the billions of dollars the company has invested in fulfillment   or they can go to Etsy  holding off the giants  with a share price that is up 50  on the year  Facebook has a role to play as well  a Facebook page is much easier for a small business to set up and is much more discoverable than a web page  and its advertising products are approachable and measurable in a way that even newspaper ads never were   Who is Being Disrupted   One of the ironies of The Innovator s Dilemma being Silicon Valley s favorite business book is that Clayton Christensen was writing for a completely different audience than your stereotypical techie  With his theory of disruption Christensen offered a compelling explanation for how it was big company managers  equipped with the best education and aided by the best consultants armed with the latest in best practices  fell prey again and again to upstart competitors with seemingly inferior products  technologists took it as a manual   What remains so compelling about Christensen s work is not its analysis of disk drives or steel mills but rather the focus on incentives  and how managers failed precisely because they did what they were supposed to do  meet the needs of their best customers in a way that ensured the viability and continued growth of their business   at least in the short term  The problem came when new technologies that were inferior for current customers  needs made it possible to serve completely new customers at lower prices  rational managers at incumbent companies dismissed those technologies  allowing new entrants to serve those markets  but given that inferior technologies improve far more quickly than user needs grow  those new entrants eventually threaten incumbents with cheaper technology that is just as good  if not better   The risk for the technology industry is that we are now the incumbents  we have a stake in keeping things exactly as they are  and we build products for ourselves   we re our own best customers  That  though  cedes the future to the powerless   those with nothing to lose under the current system will by sheer necessity build the new   That is why we need more companies like those above  ones that work for everyone  enabling the application of human creativity and ingenuity to the creation of a new world order  I know at this moment in history that seems optimistic  but the truth is that a new world order is inevitable  the question now is who will shape it,"[765 1074 162 1256 926 947 217 1166 1004 764 239]"

780,training-dataset/business/804.txt,business,Understanding Network EffectsI am a big fan of A16Z podcasts  and they just released a terrific episode on Network Effect   Network effect is an important  and somewhat confusing topic   The reason network effect is important is that the businesses with a true network effect are highly defensible  have strong retention and engagement  exhibit characteristics of a monopoly  and tend to last for a long time   Definition of Network Effect  A network effect is achieved when adding new users creates value for existing users   That is  the overall experience and value of being inside the network increase with the addition of new users   How exactly does it work   Users want something from each other  Each user in such a network is both a producer and a consumer   For example  I write blog posts  and I also read them  I post tweets  and I read other people s tweets  I check traffic on Waze and I also contribute to traffic reports on Waze   In other words  I am both producer and consumer  I am both a reader and a writer   Businesses with Strong Network Effects  Let s consider three different types of businesses with a strong network effect   social networks  multiplayer games  and sensor networks   Lets start with a canonical example   Facebook  It is famous for its network effect and organic growth  Facebook started at Harvard  and grew deliberately and slowly to ensure strong connectivity  The more friends and family that joined  the more value existing users derived   The core network effect is that basic activity on Facebook is sharing or posting to your network  Posts are the glue and the trigger   Each Facebook user is both producer and consumer  both the writer and the reader   Next  let s look at Twitter  which  much like Facebook  has a strong network effect  The interesting thing about Twitter is that because it is based on a unidirectional follow relationship  it has stronger virality  News spreads a lot faster on Twitter  yet Facebook is a stronger network because of family and friendship ties with personal photos acting as a super glue   Other kinds of businesses that have strong network effects are multiplayer games   By definition  these kinds of games are designed to be played with others  When new players join  existing players are better off  Much like on Facebook  where we see the formation of cliques of friends  in the multiplayer games we see cliques of players   The glue  and the trigger for the network effect in games is the game itself  and objects inside the game   They provide touch points  and the opportunities to co create the game world for the players  The games are highly sticky because the players need to level up  and starting from scratch in these co created worlds is very costly   Lastly  consider Waze  a traffic app acquired by Google  Cleverly  Waze creators realized that people in traffic would be willing to share their location in exchange for being informed about the overall traffic patterns and alternative routes   Each app writes data points and reads back the traffic  Each app is both a producer and consumer of information   Network Effects and Virality  Next  let s look at the difference between network effect and virality  marketplaces and economies of scale   terms often confused with network effect   Virality is about something spreading quickly over an existing network  Network effect  on the other hand  is about creation of a brand new network   For example  word of mouth is an example of virality   news about an attack in Paris travels quickly through Twitter  Pokemon Go is another example of virality   millions of people raced to play the game  And of course  funny cat videos on YouTube are known to be viral   Virality is great  and is really important in successful business  but it doesn t always last  All of the examples above are examples of short phenomenons that spike up  and then go away  We don t think of these events as sustainable over time  They are hits  or outliers  and not considered a solid foundation for the business   To put it differently  virality doesn t guarantee network effect  but network effect does guarantee virality   Network Effect and Marketplaces  Next  let s look at the relationship between marketplaces and network effect   It would seem that businesses like Uber or Airbnb would have built in network effects  And they do  to an extent  for some subset of the users for some time  but it doesn t appear to be true at scale   Marketplaces have two sides   supply and demand  producers and consumers   In the case of Uber and Airbnb  some producers happen to be consumers  but not all  Not all Uber drivers take Uber rides  and not all Uber riders are the drivers  Not all Airbnb hosts are also guests and not all Airbnb guests are hosts   These and other marketplaces have strong virality via word of mouth  but weak network effect   Some people argue that  for example  in case of AirBnB  more guests lead to more hosts  and more hosts lead to more guests  creating a virtuous cycle  creating more inventory and more value for guests  While this is true  there are two dynamics that are worth pointing out   a  There is not much loyalty or lock in between hosts and guests   most guests would book different hosts as they travel  Hosts are a substitutable goods  and thats the point  b  Abundance of guests and choice is really hard to build for AirBnB but is taken for granted by all of us  Imagine we would go to Amazon and be surprised that there is every book in the world available   Abundance is expected  so for this reason  guests don t distinguish between AirBnB in early days  when less hosts where available and AirBnB today which has a lot more choices   That said  the network effect in Marketplaces is stronger  if it involves UNIQUE value exchange  Part of the reason that eBay became a defensible business is because some sellers where selling unique items  Etsy took that concept to a new level  where all the items listed are very unique  thus creating strong network effect   Economies of Scale vs  Network Effects  In addition  marketplaces and other businesses at scale achieve supply efficiency or economies of scale   For example  UberPool becomes cheaper at scale  That is  once enough people want it  your rides get cheaper  so in a way  there is a network effect by virtue of more users joining   Another example would be a delivery service like Postmates  If the volume of the orders is low  then each delivery is a one off  and is expensive  As the volume increases and gets clustered  then deliveries become cheaper because you can aggregate deliveries together along the same route   In general  economies of scale are achieved as a business grows  For example  the business can negotiate with suppliers and get a discount in exchange for buying in bulk   This has nothing to do with the network effect of the business  but it is related to monopoly and a business  defensibility   In general  the businesses with bigger margins at scale become more powerful and more defensible   Network Effects in Nature  Before we dive into the mechanics of network effects  let s turn to nature  which is full of network effects   In science they are called self organizing networks  If you aren t familiar with this concept  I highly recommend you read Complexity  which is one of my favorite science books   To start with  carbon based life  the entire living world around us  is based on DNA and RNA  both of which have the fundamental ability to copy themselves  More importantly  DNA and RNA likely emerged as a result of a process called auto catalysis   This may sound like a bunch of scientific gibberish  but it is actually really easy to understand and plays a key role in understanding network effects   Imagine that the basic blocks of life are called A and B  One day they got together and created a new block called AB  Next  A and B blocks can be mixed with AB to form AAB or ABB  Next  you can make AAAB  AABB  BAAB  BABB and so on   That is  simple combinations of basic blocks can create more and more complex blocks and chains  In other words  a virtuous cycle  or feedback loop   How to Engineer the Network Effects  Now we are ready to understand how you may engineer  or at least check for network effects in a business   Each node needs to be part of a simple feedback loop   On Facebook  the users are readers and writers  Reading and writing create a strong feedback loop  It is this loop that pulls the users back to the service  And much like with the basic building blocks of life  it is not the one to one interactions that are so precious  it is the one to many interactions   Groups of Facebook users friends and family are constantly creating and consuming information  referencing each other  creating basic feedback loops and pulling each other back   Facebook is a massively successful business because it is a self organizing network fueled by network effects   The defensibility of Facebook is in the network structure as well as the ongoing network effects   support and formation of new parts of the network  Users who try to leave are constantly being pulled back by their friends and families   Additional reading   Economic Moats  by Brian Laung Aoaeh

810,training-dataset/product/1215.txt,product,UX design tips for your app  part 1Editor s note  We ve republished this article enjoy  And don t forget to read the second part We ve republished this article enjoy  And don t forget to read the second part here  A gorgeous app with poor UX isn t a gorgeous app it s an invitation to frustration  Your users deserve better than that   The UX design tips in this article aren t groundbreaking  Hopefully  you will already be familiar with most  if not all  of them  But for some reason or other maybe due to oversight or perhaps we were given unrealistic project deadlines we sometimes neglect these crucial UX design considerations   Here are a few tips that will help enhance your app s UX  You will also see a few examples of apps that demonstrate each UX design tip   The UX should adapt to the user  Everybody s different  so why should the UX be one size fits all   Your app should be aware of my personal condition  Take advantage of all data you have on me  Use it to give me a customized experience   My favorite travel apps  for example  present the right information before I even ask because they have learned my preferences through data such as geolocation  usage  and app settings   Digging through a bunch of content to find something I ve seen before is a waste of time   Adaptive UX examples  OpenTable is a restaurant reservation app  It also knows a lot about the user  such as what they like to eat   When I make a reservation using OpenTable  it s presented in the main menu area I can t miss it  The app s UI adapts to me  making it easy for me to see crucial  time sensitive content   And when I m thinking about making a reservation  OpenTable suggests places it thinks I ll like based on my previous restaurant reviews and my current geolocation   When you search for a restaurant only by its name  Google Search determines your geolocation and then shows you results that are nearby  That way it s not showing you a Burger King in Thailand when you re in San Francisco   To the user  it s quick and seamless and that s what good user experience design is all about but behind the scenes the app needs to determine that my search query is a restaurant  even though I didn t say it was a restaurant   determine if I m near a location  and then present the relevant info on a map  Magic   Network awareness means good UX in any context  Imagine setting your mobile device to Airplane mode  If your phone doesn t have this feature  just imagine switching off its internet connection   Which of your apps would still be useful   And which ones would be completely useless   For me  maybe a couple out of hundreds of apps have offline functionality worth a dang   And beyond simply knowing if an internet connection is available or not  the app should also sense the context of the connection   Am I on wifi  Am I out roaming  Am I anywhere near the event your app is about to send me a notification for   Some of the worst offenders send down egregious amounts of images and assets for relatively simple experiences  I don t need 39 photos to load as soon as I enter an image gallery screen  thank you very much  Please wait until I actually browse to them  We ve learned that user satisfaction is inversely tied to loading time  Why waste precious seconds loading those huge retina photos no one s going to look at   Microsoft Research has done several studies on network aware applications  Here s one of them  opens PDF   Network Aware Applications   Network aware UX example  Pocket is a save for later Web content manager  But the app is just as   if not more   useful offline   When I add an article to Pocket  it s automatically downloaded to my device so I can read it later without an Internet connection   Downloading web content onto my device seems like it would be a task  and bandwidth intensive process  But Pocket pulls it off so slickly that I hardly even notice what it s doing  It just works   We re all used to music  and video syncing  but seeing it done so seamlessly with Web content is a treat   Out of the box  Pocket makes some default choices for you  then gives specific  granular control over how your articles are saved  how your data is used  and more   Google apps fine tune a lot of its bandwidth and network usage  For example  when using Google Photos as a photo backup service  bandwidth heavy uploads only happen on wifi by default   Don t assault your users with notifications  Being frivolous with your app notifications makes your app seem needy   Notification abusive apps are like that annoying friend who just can t take a hint that we re too busy right now to meet up for coffee to talk about their  revolutionary business opportunity  which  by doing the design coding work for them with no pay  will grant us a  once in a lifetime opportunity  to be a part of something that will  change the world    And even when your notification UX is good  things can go south fast when they aren t kept in sync across the user s devices  No one wants to see the same notification over and over  Just like in software programming  a good principle to live by is to keep your notifications DRY   Even worse  Using notifications to deliver useless things like ads  or other unwanted blasts  Only in very few situations do I want to know your iOS game added 3 new characters available for micro purchase   I take it back  I never want to know that   Notification UX example  Twitter is my favorite way to communicate online  due in part to its commendable notification UX   Twitter has some of the most granular notification settings around  Even the individual options have sub options of their own  This way  the user can tailor their Twitter notifications based on their personal needs and priorities   To top it off  there s a master toggle for silencing all notifications at once  without mussing up each setting    Outside of the app  their notification emails feature easy  one click unsubscribe  with no questions asked  You d think that would be commonplace by now  but here we are   You need a search interface  Having no content is lame   But a ton of content with no way to navigate to them can be just as lame   Content that isn t surfaced is content that doesn t exist   Without a solid search interface  as a user  I m left with little defense against the horde of status updates  user profiles  and new uploads   All search interfaces are not created equal  however  Sometimes a page filled with low quality search results and a lack of filters is just as bad as not having search at all   Your customizable  groundbreaking app needs a customizable  groundbreaking search feature   Search UX examples  Etsy is a marketplace that lets anyone sell just about anything  That means they have a lot of content on the site   Just to give you a scale of how many products Etsy has on the site  My recent search for  wedding invites  yielded over 200 000 results   Good thing Etsy has a killer faceted search navigation interface  With a few taps  you can drill down into their search results with categories  product trait filters  like price or style   and sort the results to your heart s content   Imagine sorting through 200 000  results for the term  wedding invites  with zero search customization  Page after page of plain listings  hundreds of thousands deep  You will never be able to send out your wedding invitations because you were too busy looking for a wedding invitation template   When I search for images that ve been backed up by Google Photos  something magical happens   All my photos are automatically organized by keywords that I didn t have to enter manually  Google just sniffs out what s being shown in each photo somehow   Big brother concerns aside  that makes for an awesome UX design while searching your photos  Even when it s several years  worth of photos   Flickr recently launched a similar search interface  and I can only imagine our image searches will continue to get smarter from here on out   Create a good user onboarding experience  Roll out the red carpet for your new users   User onboarding is the process of getting users using your app as soon as possible   The user onboarding experience should start as soon as the app is launched for the first time  This is often referred to as the first run experience   Presenting new users with an empty screen and scant direction creates a terrible first impression  And  first impressions are the most lasting   Imagine Instagram with no photos when you launch it  or Twitter with no tweets to read   Some of the big offenders when it comes to poor user onboarding include empty content wells  friends lists with 0 friends  and a sea of confusing  equally weighted app options settings   The solution is straightforward  take the time needed to design for the blank slate   It sounds simple  but so many apps stumble with user onboarding  So much so there s even a website for collecting and critiquing onboarding processes from popular apps   Onboarding UX examples  Pinterest is a place to collect all the things you love   When a new user joins  Pinterest asks questions and learns the best types of content to present   After picking topics  a user can connect with friends from other social networks and start viewing their friends  content  Progress bars and cheeky messages cheer new users to the finish line   In seconds  a new user is transformed into a Pinterest pro through a totally decked out user experience   Slack is a communication platform designed for teams  When a new user joins  they immediately get a message from a playfully helpful  robot  named Slackbot   Slackbot introduces the key parts of the platform  via the platform itself  The hands on onboarding process gets users using the app instantly   Not only is the Slack onboarding hands on  answering questions from a robot somehow carries a lot more charm than filling in an old school web form for your name  location  etc  Slack s onboarding UX helps new users get engaged and enthralled with the platform quickly   Slack has a fantastic guided tour which trickles out over time  Instead of dumping a 14 step instructional manual on you  Slack presents just 2 3 key tips per session  spacing things out for your sanity   Is there room to improve your app s UX design   There s no shame in overlooking anything on this list  And if you feel you can enhance a certain aspect of your app  look at those areas as potential opportunities for growth   And even when things are humming right along  it s not a terrible idea to find time to take real stock of your app s user experience   Want even more UX design tips  Read

822,training-dataset/product/1136.txt,product,How to Manufacture DesireType the name of almost any successful consumer web company into your search bar and add the word  addict  after it  Go ahead  I ll wait  Try  Facebook addict  or  Instagram addict  or even  Pinterest addict  and you ll soon get a slew of results from hooked users and observers deriding the narcotic like properties of these web sites  How is it that these companies  producing little more than bits of code displayed on a screen  can seemingly control users  minds  Why are these sites so addictive and what does their power mean for the future of the web   We re on the precipice of a new era of the web  As infinite distractions compete for our attention  companies are learning to master new tactics to stay relevant in users  minds and lives  Today  just amassing millions of users is no longer good enough  Companies increasingly find that their economic value is a function of the strength of the habits they create  But as some companies are just waking up to this new reality  others are already cashing in   First to Mind Wins  A company that forms strong user habits enjoys several benefits to its bottom line  For one  this type of company creates associations with  internal triggers  in users  minds  That is to say  users come to the site without any external prompting  Instead of relying on expensive marketing or worrying about differentiation  habit forming companies get users to cue themselves to action by attaching their services to the users  daily routines and emotions  A cemented habit is when users subconsciously think   I m bored   and instantly Facebook comes to mind  They think   I wonder what s going on in the world   and before rationale thought occurs  Twitter is the answer  The first to mind solution wins   Manufacturing Desire  But how do companies create a connection with the internal cues needed to form habits  The answer  they manufacture desire  While fans of Mad Men are familiar with how the ad industry once created consumer desire during Madison Avenue s golden era  those days are long gone  A multi screen world  with ad wary consumers and a lack of ROI metrics  has rendered Don Draper s big budget brainwashing useless to all but the biggest brands  Instead  startups manufacture desire by guiding users through a series of experiences designed to create habits  I call these experiences  Hooks   and the more often users run through them  the more likely they are to self trigger   I wrote Hooked  How to Build Habit Forming Products to help others understand what is at the heart of habit forming technology and I m hosting a conference on the topic called the Habit Summit   The book highlights common patterns I observed in my career in the video gaming and online advertising industries  While my model is generic enough for a broad explanation of habit formation  I ll focus on applications in consumer Internet for this post   Trigger  The trigger is the actuator of a behavior the spark plug in the Hook Model  Triggers come in two types  external and internal  Habit forming technologies start by alerting users with external triggers like an email  a link on a web site  or the app icon on a phone  By cycling continuously through these hooks  users begin to form associations with internal triggers  which become attached to existing behaviors and emotions  Soon users are internally triggered every time they feel a certain way  The internal trigger becomes part of their routine behavior and the habit is formed   For example  suppose Barbra  a young lady in Pennsylvania  happens to see a photo in her Facebook newsfeed taken by a family member from a rural part of the State  It s a lovely photo and since she s planning a trip there with her brother Johnny  the trigger intrigues her   Action  After the trigger comes the intended action  Here  companies leverage two pulleys of human behavior   motivation and ability  To increase the odds of a user taking the intended action  the behavior designer makes the action as easy as possible  while simultaneously boosting the user s motivation  This phase of the Hook draws upon the art and science of usability design to ensure that the user acts the way the designer intends   Using the example of Barbra  with a click on the interesting picture in her newsfeed she s taken to a website she s never been to before called Pinterest  Once she s done the intended action  in this case  clicking on the photo   she s dazzled by what she sees next   Variable Reward  What separates Hooks from a plain vanilla feedback loop is their ability to create wanting in the user  Feedback loops are all around us  but predictable ones don t create desire  The predictable response of your fridge light turning on when you open the door doesn t drive you to keep opening it again and again  However  add some variability to the mix say a different treat magically appears in your fridge every time you open it and voila  intrigue is created  You ll be opening that door like a lab animal in a Skinner box   Variable schedules of reward are one of the most powerful tools that companies use to hook users  Research shows that levels of dopamine surge when the brain is expecting a reward  Introducing variability multiplies the effect  creating a frenzied hunting state  activating the parts associated with wanting and desire  Although classic examples include slot machines and lotteries  variable rewards are prevalent in habit forming technologies as well   When Barbra lands on Pinterest  not only does she see the image she intended to find  but she s also served a multitude of other glittering objects  The images are associated with what she s generally interested in   namely things to see during a trip to rural Pennsylvania   but there are some others that catch her eye also  The exciting juxtaposition of relevant and irrelevant  tantalizing and plain  beautiful and common sets her brain s dopamine system aflutter with the promise of reward  Now she s spending more time on the site  hunting for the next wonderful thing to find  Before she knows it  she s spent 45 minutes scrolling in search of her next hit   Investment  The last phase of the Hook is where the user is asked to do bit of work  This phase has two goals as far as the behavior engineer is concerned  The first is to increase the odds that the user will make another pass through the Hook when presented with the next trigger  Second  now that the user s brain is swimming in dopamine from the anticipation of reward in the previous phase  it s time to pay some bills  The investment generally comes in the form of asking the user to give some combination of time  data  effort  social capital or money   But unlike a sales funnel  which has a set endpoint  the investment phase isn t about consumers opening up their wallets and moving on with their day  The investment implies an action that improves the service for the next go around  Inviting friends  stating preferences  building virtual assets  and learning to use new features are all commitments that improve the service for the user  These investments can be leveraged to make the trigger more engaging  the action easier  and the reward more exciting with every pass through the Hook   As Barbra enjoys endlessly scrolling the Pinterest cornucopia  she builds a desire to keep the things that delight her  By collecting items  she ll be giving the site data about her preferences  Soon she will follow  pin  re pin  and make other investments  which serve to increase her ties to the site and prime her for future loops through the Hook   Super Power  A reader recently wrote to me   If it can t be used for evil  it s not a super power   He s right  And under this definition  habit design is indeed a super power  If used for good  habits can enhance people s lives with entertaining and even healthful routines  If used to exploit  habits can turn into wasteful addictions   But  like it or not  habit forming technology is already here  The fact that we have greater access to the web through our various devices also gives companies greater access to us  As companies combine this greater access with the ability to collect and process our data at higher speeds than ever before  we re faced with a future where everything becomes potentially more addictive  This trinity of access  data  and speed creates new opportunities for habit forming technologies to hook users  Companies need to know how to harness the power of Hooks to improve peoples  lives  while consumers need to understand the mechanics of behavior engineering to protect themselves from unwanted manipulation   What do you think  Hooks are all around us  Where do you see them manufacturing desire in your life   Here s the gist   The degree to which a company can utilize habit forming technologies will increasingly decide which products and services succeed or fail   Habit forming technology creates associations with  internal triggers  which cue users without the need for marketing  messaging or other external stimuli   Creating associations with internal triggers comes from building the four components of a  Hook    a trigger  action  variable reward  and investment   Consumers must understand how habit forming technology works to prevent unwanted manipulation while still enjoying the benefits of these innovations   Companies must understand the mechanics of habit formation to increase engagement with their products and services and ultimately help users create beneficial routines   Nir Eyal is a best selling author and entrepreneur  His new LinkedIn Learning course on creating habit forming products is free to

840,training-dataset/product/1118.txt,product,How to Attract and Keep Your App s UsersIn this guest blog post  Shawn Parrotte  Marketing Manager at Designli and friend of the Founder Institute  explains how to make your app more attractive to users  as well as how to keep them coming back   Customers are using apps now more than ever  and mobile usage will only continue to grow  And while building an app may seem like a smart move for aspiring entrepreneurs  keep in mind that there is still the considerable challenge of getting users to regularly use your app   The Reality Of Mobile Apps  Let s look at the facts about people s mobile usage  The average smartphone user spends about 90  of their time in apps  while the other 10  they re surfing the mobile web  This sounds like great news for app developers  doesn t it   Collectively  we know we re all pretty much glued to our phones  so apps must be getting a huge chunk of the action  right  Well  yes and no   Unfortunately  our habits don t necessarily translate to a large number of apps  Think about how many apps you use on a regular basis  If you re like most people  you have between five and seven that you spend most of your time in   But let s dig into the numbers even further  Did you know that 23  of apps downloaded are never used again after the first open  And even more shocking  a whopping 25  of apps are never even opened at all  Not even once   We know that mobile use is on the rise and the app economy continues to grow   And it s projecting to the a  100billion  industry in 2020   But by understanding how people natively use apps  you can make sure your users will love yours  Because you don t want to be lumped into either of those statistics   So how can you make people come back to your app again and again   Before we ask that question  you now know there are two barriers that lie ahead  The barrier of first open and the barrier of second open  If you can get past them  then you ll have a good chance of making your app stick  Let s looks at some strategies to overcome these barriers   Why Open an App in the First Place   Let s consider the first open  What would make someone download an app but not use it  You ve probably done this at least once  Maybe you read about a particular app in a blog you follow  Maybe a friend told you about one they use all the time  Maybe you downloaded one while you were just browsing the app store  Why did you let it rot on the 3rd  4th  or 5th page on your phone   There s a very real possibility is that an unopened app just isn t compelling enough to invest the time and mental energy into  If a user is confused about what value an app has for them  why would they go through the trouble of trying to figure it out by themselves   Here are some strategies for getting the first open   Don t be Everything to Everyone  Successful apps do one thing and do it well  They may pick up other features as they grow  but that s they start simple  Be extremely focused about what kind of value your app brings to your audience  No one want to have to figure it out for themselves   Express your Value as Vibrantly and as Often as Possible  This means creating enticing copy on the app stores  a website that conveys the value your app creates  and even an entire brand that represents how you want to impact people s lives through your app  These just remove any doubt or confusion from your potential users   Create a Unique Experience  Highlight how you re creating a unique experience that users can only get through your app  This is important for B2B or ecommerce apps  Can you add unique discovery elements or social sharing  For an added nudge  maybe consider offering a discount on the first purchase made through the app   First Impressions Lead to Second Opens  Now that you ve gotten your user  through the door  so to speak  why wouldn t you want them to come back  For the return journey  getting your users to make that second open relies on the first going exceptionally well  For this barrier  you need to create a seamless and engaging first impression   If signing up  connecting all relevant information  and learning how to use your app is intuitive  then your users will know that you truly understand their needs  They can then feel safe and confident that it s worth investing the time to use your app  They may even save space on their home screen for you   Here are some strategies for a solid first impression   Get to the features fast  The more ways you block someone from getting to try out what your app really does  the higher chance they ll get annoyed and leave  Spend the time to craft a quick and enjoyable sign up process and a fun and simple on boarding experience  Don t bombard them with required forms or force them to create a lengthy profile right at the beginning  Get to the good stuff   Reward them for performing the right actions  Once your user is engaged  you want them to see magic that your app creates  and reward them for it  Consider adding subtle elements of gamification to your app  it could be as simple as a congratulatory message or as complex as a point system or rankings   A Little Push Maybe   Another  more abrupt way of encouraging a second open is to use push notifications to draw interest back into the app  You have to be careful with these because they can be annoying and off putting if they re not tastefully executed   If there s a way to personalize a notification based on the information you ve gleaned from the first interaction  while also sharing very relevant and engaging information  it might be the right kind of nudge that incentivizes your user to come back and engage with your app the second time   Why Not Test   A common way for overcoming these barriers is to do extensive user testing on your app before releasing the final  first  version   Many companies start out with an MVP of their app  a way of testing out the absolute minimum functionality app  to get it into the hands of the people who are going to use it so you can test the assumptions of how the app works and if those using it can figure out the functions of the app in the way that you intended   If you have the budget to build out an MVP before the final version  it can be a huge asset for your mobile development strategy   Creatively Bold  Humbly Priced

860,training-dataset/business/491.txt,business,Thoughts on Pokemon Go   True VenturesAfter hearing about Pokemon Go  I spent a good part of the weekend playing it  then watching my family play it  In just a few short days  Pokemon has gone from being an old card game for little kids to the hottest app digital experience for all ages  It s transformed how we experience reality through our phones  and it did so smoothly and with alacrity  in a matter of days   What s so special about it  There are many impressive compute and game dynamics at play here  but I m most impacted by three aspects of the app   1  The third person  avatar  view is just real enough to be believed  but it s not meant to be perfect  I m fond of saying that  perfect is the enemy of great   and this is an example of great UI  Our brains are extremely harsh judges of things that try to be realistic but fall slightly short  I think this is a big challenge for the VR and AR revolution of which we are on the verge  If something is represented to us as  real  then we judge  but when presented with something that is clearly not  real  our brains are incredibly adept at accepting representations and  smoothing the lines  or  filling in  the gaps cognitively  I think this is what s going on with the walking avatar view of yourself  Your street town map is just close enough to be accurate  but it s not perfect  So instead of trying to  judge it  we accept it  admire it  I find myself  amazed  that it s as accurate as it is  versus complaining or being confused that it s not accurate  This is a subtle but incredibly challenging line to walk for UI developers   2  Camera integration it s just a  wow  to discover a Pokemon in your hallway  It looks amazing  it  feels real  and the tiny little screen seems like just a small square of virtual sewn into reality  It s just that good   3  The integration with the real world  in the form of artifacts  and the need for movement   actually walking around the real world to progress the game   creates a connection to what s around you  Yes  this past weekend people were walking around even MORE zombified by their phones  but something is different  because they are actually watching the real world  I know  bear with me   and along the way learning more about that world through the artifacts and Easter eggs of the app  Knowing that the LA artist painted the piece in the Virgin terminal is additive to your real world experience  Far from distancing you from your surroundings  this app connects you more deeply with it   We re on the edge of an enormous revolution in user interface design due to the emergence of virtual and augmented reality systems and computing  These platform shifts are never easy to predict  and technology has a funny way of leaping forward in unexpected ways  Surprises happen all the time  and I m most struck that Pokemon Go might be one of these enormous surprises for the AR movement  What if Pokemon Go surpasses the other  heavier attempts to bring AR to the world   What if it s to MagicLeap what Facebook was to SecondLife the swifter  lighter  more intuitive solution to an advanced computing and cognitive UX problem  SecondLife and MagicLeap are moonshots and that is what makes them so unique  I have a TON of respect for those teams and ambitions  and  full disclosure  we at True have invested behind Philip and the SL team twice  they are brilliant  But what if this swifter  faster  cleaner way of augmenting reality leaps over the heavier attempts that we all see now  The result could be a dramatically faster adoption of AR   Facebook trumped heavier social interaction systems like SecondLife  Friendster and others for lots of reasons  And  while it s not a perfect analogy  its light weight platform solved an unmet need for virtual social relationships  Pokemon Go appears and suddenly a Pokemon is in your house  your yard  your town  The app is fast  intuitive  and indeed it augments reality beautifully  with cartoony characters and beings  No headset required  no VR setup  no fancy retinal painting technology needed  Just you  your phone  the world   This is the new interface and experience for so many applications  and my prediction is we will soon see augmented mixed reality boom in simple ways  Recall the earlier AR demos of a few years ago  Perhaps now they become reality  Yelp reviews while holding your camera up to a menu  We weren t ready for that a few years back  but we are now  thanks to all of the user training happening now on PokemonGo  Within three years  I predict we ll watch feature length films  set in our house  perhaps with  selfie cameos  of us with the talent  Don t get me wrong I love the Vive and Oculus experience  and True is investing heavily in this space   but I think this weekend we witnessed the birth of the  big  AR and VR boom  The proliferation and power of the smartphone puts augmented reality in the hands of billions  instantly  No clunky gear and no wired connection required  Look out real world  the virtuals are on the way,"[860 472 135 294 217 594 1302 840 810 1233 1296]"
874,training-dataset/business/1060.txt,business,Platform Strategy   by Sangeet Paul ChoudaryThis article was originally published on the Harvard Business Review  This article was co authored with Marshall Van Alstyne and Geoffrey Parker   The success of platform businesses like Alibaba  Airbnb  and Uber is so remarkable that discussion about them often misses just how hard they are to build  For every successful platform  there are many more that struggle or simply don t make it  Apple and Google  two of the world s most valuable companies  have had their share of platform failures as we ll show  Studying these successes and failures  we ve identified half a dozen key reasons platforms fail  all of which boil down to managers  misunderstanding of how platforms operate and compete   Platform businesses bring together producers and users in efficient exchanges of value   Uber  for example  connects drivers and passengers just as YouTube connects videographers and viewers  And  they leverage network effects   the more participants on the platform  the greater the value produced  Managerial mistakes that inhibit value exchange or network effects can kill a platform  Let s look at the key errors   1 Failure to optimize  openness   Because platforms depend on the value created by participants  it s critical to carefully manage the platform s  openness    the degree of access that consumers  producers  and others have to a platform  and what they re allowed to do there  If platforms are too closed  keeping potentially desirable participants out  network effects stall  if they re too open there can be other value destroying effects  such as poor quality contributions or misbehavior of some participants that causes others to defect   Steve Jobs failed miserably at managing openness at Apple in the 1980s  He charged developers for toolkits   inhibiting the very software producers he should have wanted on Apple s platform  The result was that Apple struggled to create a robust platform connecting Apple customers and software producers  For years Apple s market penetration hung in the single digits  Apple has since figured out this balance  of course  by opening the iOS platforms to app developers  By contrast  Bill Gates opened Windows to both software and hardware developers  making Windows the dominant desktop platform by virtue of its superior ability to connect software and hardware producers with consumers   Yet platforms can become too open  They must retain enough control over core assets to maintain control of the ecosystem and to make money  Google learned this lesson when Amazon and Samsung fragmented   forked  in tech lingo  the open Android platform to create their own open source versions  Google Android quickly lost market share to the new versions  Reacting quickly  Google regained control of the Android system by restricting access to difficult to replicate services such as mapping and by shifting important application programming interfaces  APIs  to the proprietary Google Play Store  Android s story demonstrates that platform openness is one of the key managerial decisions that can determine platform success or failure   2  Failure to engage developers  Opening platforms the right amount is necessary but not sufficient  The platform owner must also show software developers what s in it for them if they contribute  In 2013  Johnson Controls invited developers to help them build Panoptix  an energy efficiency platform for buildings and office space  But by early 2015 they stopped accepting new submissions to their open market and discontinued their API support for external developers  Panoptix had not attracted enough new apps to justify pouring resources into supporting this limited external development   It s not enough to open the door and set the table  Successful platforms engage in platform evangelism  providing developers with resources to innovate  feedback on design and performance  and rewards for participation  Think of it this way  To host a successful event you must plan carefully  invite the right people  have the right food  and manage competition with the party next door  If Android throws a Hawaiian luau with a five course feast  free travel  and attendees get to meet Robert Downey Jr  and Sandra Bullock the same night that Johnson Controls offers crackers in Cleveland and asks attendees to cover their own costs  which party will developers attend   3  Failure to share the surplus  Having valuable interactions is the reason to participate on a platform  The consumer  the producer  and the platform all win if the division of value works for everyone  But if one party gets insufficient value  then they have no reason to participate  Back in 2000  several automakers including Daimler Chrysler  Ford  GM  Nissan and others invested in Covisint  an online marketplace intended to match buyers and suppliers of auto parts  Unfortunately  Covisint s ownership structure and auction format heavily favored auto companies  the consumers on the platform  while forcing suppliers into fierce price competition  leaving them with little or no residual value  As a result  parts suppliers left the platform and the market never became sustainably profitable  In 2004  the residual assets were sold off for a mere  7 million  a tiny fraction of the  500 million auto manufacturers had invested   A simple rule for platform managers is to take less value than you make  and share value fairly with all participants   4  Failure to launch the right side  Platform managers have to carefully determine which side of the platform market to emphasize  and when  Sometimes at launch it s important to focus on attracting consumers over producers  sometimes it s the reverse  and sometime both sides need equal attention from the outset   Despite huge fanfare and an experienced platform leader  Google Health failed  Google Health was intended to be the premier place for consumers to consolidate their health information  Google tried its preferred strategy of focusing first on the consumer side of the market  an approach that worked beautifully for search  email  and maps  But this time  Google needed to focus first on providers   the other side of the market  Consumers might have used the service if the doctors and insurers who held their information were willing to engage  But they didn t welcome the scrutiny or the loss of control over data they already possessed  Securing their participation will be critical if health information platforms are to succeed   5  Failure to put critical mass ahead of money  Do you remember Billpoint  It was the digital payment system eBay pushed before it gave up and acquired PayPal  As the insider on an established platform  Billpoint should have won  But where Billpoint emphasized fraud prevention  PayPal emphasized ease of use  While Billpoint charged higher transaction fees  PayPal gave away  5 and  10 payments to users who signed up other users  Fraud prevention can keep platform costs down over the long term but puts friction on user transactions  which dissuades value creating activity  PayPal ate the costs of fraud and emphasized rapid growth by simplifying transactions and incenting participants to attract others  As a result  PayPal rapidly surpassed Billpoint as the payment system of choice on eBay  Conceding defeat in 2002  eBay bought PayPal for  1 4 billion and phased out Billpoint a year later  Billpoint made the mistake of emphasizing revenue generation at the start rather than  first  attracting a critical mass of participants   Even after the subsidies end  platform monetization that comes at the expense of building network effects is rarely sustainable in the long run as it works against the core mechanism by which platforms create value at scale   6  Failure of imagination  Perhaps the most egregious platform failure is to simply not see the platform play at all  It is also one of the hardest for traditional firms to avoid  Firms guilty of this oversight never get past the idea that they sell products when they could be building ecosystems  Sony  Hewlett Packard  HP   and Garmin all made the mistake of emphasizing products over platforms  Before the iPhone launched in 2007  HP dominated the handheld calculator space for science and finance  Yet today  consumers can purchase near perfect calculator apps on iTunes or on Google Play and at a fraction of the cost of a physical calculator  Apple and Google did not create these emulators  they merely enabled them by providing the platform that connects app producers and consumers who need calculators   Sony has sold some of the best electronic products ever made  It once dominated the personal portable music space with the Walkman  It had the world s first and best compact disc players  By 2011  its PlayStation had become the best selling game console of all time  Yet  for all its technological prowess Sony focused too much on products and not enough on creating platforms   What became of Sony s players  A platform   iOS   ate them for lunch   Garmin  as a tailored mapping device  suffered a similar fate  As of 2012  Garmin had sold 100 million units after 23 years in the market  By contrast  iPhone sold 700 million units after just eight years in the market  More people get directions from an iPhone than from a Garmin  not only because of Apple maps but also because of Google Maps and Waze  As platforms  iOS and Android have ecosystems of producers  consumers  and others that have helped them triumph over such products as the Cisco Flip camera  the Sony PSP  the Flickr photo service  the Olympus voice recorder  the Microsoft Zune  the Magnus flashlight  and the Fitbit fitness tracker   When a platform enters the market  product managers who focus on features are not just measuring the wrong things  they re thinking the wrong thoughts   TWEETABLE TAKEAWAYS  Platform failure  why the mighty fail Share this  6 lessons in platform failure Share this  Factors that lead to failure of network effects Share

882,training-dataset/product/11.txt,product,You Have an App Idea  What Now Everyone loves apps  And since it s easier than ever to build an app that people will love  turning an app into a lucrative startup is an attractive career choice for aspiring founders  However  the challenge that every founder must face is how to turn an idea into something tangible  And that s why Keith Shields of Designli has written this blog post that outlines the next steps founders should take to bring their app ideas to life   The blog post   I Have An App Idea  Where Do I Start   Part 1    originally appeared on the Designli blog and has been republished with permission   So  you have an app idea   What do you do now   Some people do a quick Google search  see something relatively similar  and give up  Others research the process that creating an app entails  realize it s not as easy as it sounds  and   again   give up  So   since you re already this far  congratulations on being farther along in the process than most  We re here to help get you off the ground   Step 1  Get the Lay of the Land  The first thing that should be on your radar is  if you haven t already  to hit the ground Googlin   Over 1 000 new apps hit the App Store each and every day   so  odds are there is something relatively similar already out there  If not  than you re in luck  And if so  that s not a dealbreaker either  It s all about the execution  and if you can execute on that concept better than the last person  then you ll still be ahead of the game   Think about it this way  Facebook wasn t the first social network  Friendster and Myspace came before it  But  which platform do you use today   So  rather than worrying about if there is anyone else doing what you want to do  think about how you can improve off of those existing apps  Learn from them and see which features people like and which ones they don t   Step 2  Brainstorm Full Functionality   Specs  You know your competitors and what is already out there  and can now bring that back to the drawing board and think about exactly what your app will do  What functionality will it have   Many first time entrepreneurs go crazy here  They come out the other side of this step with a 30 page document explaining all of their product s nice to have s  Although this is tempting  maintain some discipline here   Focus on your Minimum Viable Product  What are the core features that will make your app stand out  It should do just a few things  and do them very well  We preach to our clients  perhaps counter intuitively for an app development company  to have as simple of a  V1  as possible  this lets our clients release their app  gather feedback  and pivot as necessary   This is called a  Specifications Document   and is the best way to portray your idea to any app designers or developers that you may be working with in the future  That s why it s best to get this stuff written down now  in advance  prior to moving forward   Step 3  Understand your Development Options  You know your competitors  You know what your app will do  Now  it s time to figure out how this thing will be built   Is it something that is simple   like an app that will help your restaurant put its menu on an app  Or a simple data app  that shows text to users within certain pages  If so  a out of the box app builder platform is definitely your best bet  There are many  many options out there that let you create simple  canned functionality  apps for a minimal cost  like   What happens if your app needs more than the limited amount of features that an app builder like these can provide  As an example  when SnapChat first came out  there wasn t a templated  app builder  that could make photos disappear  This requires custom coding  where a development shop like Designli is needed  If your app needs custom functionality  it s time to start thinking about how the full app development process works   First and foremost  pursuing the paid app development course will require a budget  Apps typically start at  10 000  depending on the company that you ll hire to develop your idea  and their location   and work their way up from there  Do you have access to capital to invest in your new business  If not  it may be time to start thinking about raising some money from Friends and Family  or entering a business plan competition that will give you a cash prize if you bring home the win   Our company  Designli  specializes in this realm  As an agency that develops apps for startups and entrepreneurs  we work with people in your shoes all the time  In order to ease the pain of raising investment and getting others to  buy in  to your brilliant idea  we provide services that can help   One thing you may notice right away is that it s hard to convince others to give you money in order to build your app  It s even harder if you are a first time entrepreneur  and have nothing to show potential investors other than a few written paragraphs describing your idea  You may  and should  have a business plan  or at the very least a Specification Document as outlined in Step 2 above   Our company focuses on helping with this upfront challenge by providing a fixed price Graphic Design package for our clients  We ll take your Specification Document and wireframe out   and complete the entire design for   every screen of your app  At the conclusion of this package  you ll know exactly what every screen of your app will look like and what features it will have  You ll also have a click through prototype showing exactly how the app will work  Put this on a potential investor s phone and they ll think you re already halfway to the finish line  and they ll have no problem understanding what your app will do and how it ll do it   Step 4 and Beyond  Development   Now that you have your app designed and your functionality written both in plain English and displayed visually  there ll be no confusion when it comes time to develop the app  Now s the time to shop for a development team  How do you do that  you ask  There are tens of thousands of app development companies after all   This is a conversation for another day  and a lengthy one at that   so  we ll see you soon for Part 2 of this post  In the meantime  you have your marching orders   let s get your functionality solidified and a decision made as far as paths for design and development    Apps concept with person holding a smartphone image by Shutterstock,"[882 1233 840 38 647 1318 810 1181 411 623 217]"
885,training-dataset/engineering/1134.txt,engineering,Instagram in 2015   Instagram EngineeringUnder the Hood  Instagram in 2015  2015 was a big year for Instagram   between reimagining the discovery experience with Search and Explore and trending content  launching new stand alone creative apps  rebuilding Direct  and scaling our infrastructure across data centers  a lot was happening under the hood  As the year winds down  we wanted to recap some of our biggest product  design  and engineering moments from the year  what we learned  and what we imagine for the next run around the sun  We ve made a lot of progress on creative tools  discovery  and communication this year  and as we look to 2016  we re excited to apply what we ve learned   Creativity  When Instagram was built in 2010  phone cameras weren t great  and filters were built to make sure you could share beautiful photos you were proud of  Since then  our cameras have improved  but the desire for creative control and personalization has grown and expanded past anything we initially conceived  Here s a look at some of our biggest creative tools moments this year   Layout  In March  we launched Layout  our second standalone app  Like with all of our features  the inspiration for Layout came from how the community was using Instagram  We were increasingly seeing that people wanted flexibility   they were overlaying  mirroring  resizing  and flipping duplicates of the same photo or multiple photos to create new looks  In fact  one in five of our monthly active users were sharing images that combined multiple photos   We decided to zero in on this behavior and see if we could make it a simple  easy  and native experience within Instagram  Working with our UEX team  we built a set of features that responded directly to user research and feedback  For example  the majority of collage apps require you to select your format first  and your photos second  This kind of felt like having to choose your filter before taking your photo  so we decided to show you photos first  and then offer different Layout previews  We also created a  Faces  tab because we saw that the vast majority of collage type photos on Instagram were of people  and wanted to make the photos with people easily accessible   Portrait and Landscape Support  The Instagram square is iconic   it s simple  aesthetically pleasing  and part of our DNA  But over the past few years  the creativity from our community has inspired us and opened our eyes to what s possible when you experiment with image formats  As we watched our feeds  it looked like portrait and landscape formats were becoming increasingly popular   and the data backed it up  We found that one in five impressions in feed weren t squares  and we knew we had to take the leap to enable the flexibility and creative freedom to share any moment  in any format   Boomerang  Boomerang was our second creative app of the year  and started as a hackathon project this summer with a designer and small group of Instagram s Android engineers  It takes a burst of photos and stitches them together into a high quality mini video that plays forward and back  helping you turn everyday moments into something fun and unexpected  We ve been inspired by the creativity of the video community on Instagram over the past two years and with looping videos and Hyperlapse  people are experimenting with motion in new and exciting ways  Boomerang unlocks additional ways to experiment with motion  Boomerang was also the first app we ve been able to launch on iOS and Android at the same time   Boomerang on iPhone uses the same technology that made Hyperlapse possible  When recording on the phone  we store camera rotation data alongside the video  At playback time  we align the rotations to the video frames in real time and create a synthetic camera that has a cinematic feel   Discovery  With over 400 million people using Instagram every month  and uploading an average of 80M photos a day  the amount of content on Instagram is constantly growing and evolving  Before this year  there wasn t always a consistent way to find and parse this content  and we wanted to create a way to surface the best and most relevant content in a personalized way  Early this year we launched search  hashtag and location pages on web  and later launched a reimagined Search and Explore with trending  Now  we re experimenting with live curations around major events like Halloween and New Years  We re just getting started  and as we move into next year  discovery will continue to be a core focus  But first  let s take a deeper look at what we launched this year   Search and Explore  Instagram s Datagram team builds the systems that power Search  Explore  Trending  Ranking  and Account Suggestions  The team works end to end  organized around the lifecycle of data  This year  the datagram team built Instagram s search infrastructure and trending system that can parse over 70m new photos each day from over 200m people  In early 2015 we migrated our search infrastructure to Facebook s unicorn  creating a 65  increase in search traffic as a result of both user growth and a 12  jump in the number of people who are using search every time they use Instagram  This move  which allowed us to rank queries using social features and second order connections  made it possible for us to index every part of the Instagram graph and power the ability to search for anything you want   people  places  hashtags  media   faster and more easily in Search and Explore   And in order to show all this content in a timely  relevant way  we also built a system to define  identify  and rank trends For example  people don t usually post about the Aurora Borealis  but on the day we launched  a significant group of people was sharing amazing photos using the hashtag  northernlights  We also built a way to group trends so that you re not seeing duplicates  For example  the figure below illustrates all the hashtags that were used in media together with  equality  It shows that  equality was trending together with related hashtags  such as  lovewins   love   pride   lgbt and many others  By grouping these tags together  we can show  equality as the trend  and save the need to sift through all the different tags until reaching other interesting trends   Read more about our search infrastructure here and ranking here   Integrating with Apple s 3D Touch  This year Apple released the iPhone 6s  which added a new hardware feature called 3D Touch  We were able to integrate this new technology into Instagram early on and were excited by how natural the shortcuts and peeking on photos and videos felt  For example  you might use 3D Touch when you are interested in a piece of content but aren t committed to navigating there yet  With this in mind  Peek and Pop gives you a glimpse of what lies ahead and lets you quickly back out to continue browsing  And Quick Actions allow you to jump straight to creating a new post or look at what s been happening in your Instagram without having to wait for everything to load up first  These APIs were seamless to use  and helped us create new ways for people to find and interact with content  Read more about what we learned from building 3D Touch here   Improved Image Resolution  When we re building features for Instagram  we prioritize simplicity  utility  and performance  Until recently  we kept all photos at a 640x640 resolution to ensure consistent quality  but now that there is such a variety of device resolutions  it didn t make sense to limit resolution anymore  This summer we improved the resolution of photos on Instagram  keeping all images between 320 and 1080 at their original resolution  upscaling small images to 320x320  or downscaling large images to 1080x1080 as necessary  We revisited our production and distribution pipeline to optimize for quality and payload so that the vast majority of images will now look as good or better  while being as small as possible  and most often smaller   at all resolutions  We were able to do this thanks to progressive jpeg  which was designed to allow people see  something  before an image is fully received  Now every time we find a new way to surface content  we can make sure it looks its best  Look out for more information on photo resolution on the engineering blogin the coming months   Communication  Part of Instagram s mission is to give people a visual voice   as phone cameras become better and more ubiquitous  images are emerging as a new form of language  We want to make sure the community has the freedom to express this voice however they want   whether it s publicly or 1 1  We also want to make sure that people are able to communicate whenever or wherever they are  This year was big for communication on Instagram   we launched a new version of Direct  built an app on the Apple Watch  and made major improvements to our infrastructure to ensure people can connect reliably   Direct  We launched Instagram Direct in 2013 as a way to share moments with one person or a smaller group  Since then  tens of millions of people were using it to connect to their community  but wanted to be able to keep conversations going  and more easily share what they were finding on Instagram  This year  we completely rebuilt Direct s infrastructure to make it easier to start and have visual conversations  and support threaded messages  more fully featured groups  and sharing posts from feed  When we launched  instead of releasing to a percentage of users  one country  or everyone at once  we decided to do a unique rollout that would utilize the network effect of messaging and allow people to have the feature as soon as they heard about it  We started with a few countries  and anyone those people messaged had the new version of Direct turned on instantly   Instagram for Apple Watch  When Apple launched the Watch  we were excited to try out a new platform and reimagine Instagram for a quick  on the go experience  Instagram s existing iPhone app wasn t exactly transferable   the Watch didn t have a camera  and wasn t suited for an infinite scrolling feed  So we decided to focus in on immediacy and personalization   how could we alert you to the most important moments posted by the people you care most about  We built notifications that allowed you to see when your friends posted photos  and quick like and emoji responses so you can participate in their moment quickly and easily   Firestorm  In 2013  we had 200 million monthly active users and it was clear that we needed to make some infrastructure changes to continue to support our growing community  At that point we began  Instagration    moving our infrastructure from AWS to Facebook s servers  This year  with 400 million monthly active users  we decided to scale our infrastructure geographically to three data centers to make sure the community continues to have a reliable experience no matter where they are   Just a few months later  we put it to the test  Facebook regularly tests its data centers by shutting them down during peak hours  and a couple months ago  right as we had finished migrated our data to a new data center  Facebook ran a test and took it down  And we passed the test without users noticing  To learn more about how our data center migration has helped give us more flexible capacity planning and acquisition  higher reliability  and better preparedness for disasters here   Cheers   Over the last year we ve made a step change in the quality of how and when you discover what s happening  improved how the community connects and communicates  and opened up new ways for people to show what s happening in their world and share their visual voices  In 2016 we ll continue improving these experiences and features  as well as create some brand new experiences that we hope will inspire and connect our community  and be fun to build   Happy New Year,"[885 217 1023 810 623 1318 467 1210 1358 1242 476]"
913,training-dataset/business/675.txt,business,Google and the Limits of Strategy   Stratechery by Ben ThompsonJohn Gruber is not impressed by the suggestion that Google s new Pixel phone  which the company introduced at a keynote yesterday  is the first time the company has competed head to head with the iPhone   Google has been going head to head against the iPhone ever since the first Android phone debuted  You can t say the Nexus phones don t count just because they never succeeded  Google then VP of engineering Vic Gundotra devoted his 2010 I O keynote to ripping into the iPhone and iPad  pedal to the metal on  open beats closed  and how an ecosystem of over 60 different Android devices  a drop in the pond compared to today  was winning  saving the world from a future where  one man  one company  one device  controls mobile   Gundotra tossed in  one carrier   which was true at the time  but looks foolish in hindsight   He even compared the iPhone to Orwell s 1984  Really  The only thing Orwellian here is Google s attempt to flush down the memory hole their previous attempts to go head to head against the iPhone  Watch the first 10 minutes of Gundotra s 2010 keynote   the whole thing is about beating the iPhone   Gruber is both right and wrong  yes  Gundotra s rhetoric was stridently anti Apple  but at the end of that keynote everyone in attendance received an HTC EVO 4G  when it came to the zero sum game of actually putting phones in people s pockets  Apple s competitors  then  were companies like HTC  Motorola  and especially Samsung  Granted  those manufacturers  phones ran Google s Android software  but then again Google s software ran on the iPhone  too  in fact  at the time of Gundotra s speech  Google Maps  YouTube  and Google Search were all built into iOS   As we know today that wouldn t be the case for long  two years later iOS 6 dumped the YouTube app and  more famously  changed the default mapping application from one based on Google to Apple s own  The proximate cause was not Gundotra s speech  though  in fact  Apple had purchased a mapping company called Placebase in 2009  and a few months later Google had introduced turn by turn navigation  it was Android only   Google Versus Android  Very few people know for sure who exactly is to blame for the Google Apple breakup  Yes  Steve Jobs was livid that Android phones looked a lot like iPhones  but remember  Google purchased Android two years before the iPhone came out  and a year before Eric Schmidt joined Apple s board  as a hedge against Microsoft  once the iPhone came out  why but for pride would you build a phone any differently   Where Google went wrong was with that maps decision  making turn by turn directions an Android exclusive differentiated Android as a platform  but to what end  So that HTC et al could sell a few more phones  and pay Google nothing for the privilege   The truth is that when it came to making money Google and Apple were not competitors in the slightest  Apple was a vertical company that expended R D and capital investment to design and build devices that included significant material costs  and then sold those devices in a zero sum competition against other manufacturers  Yes  marketshare was important  but so was profitability  Apple traded off reaching the entire market in favor of creating a differentiated experience that customers would pay a premium for that far exceeded the  significant  marginal costs of each iPhone   Google  meanwhile  has always been a completely different kind of company   a horizontal one  Nearly all of Google s costs are fixed   R D and data centers   which means profitability goes hand in hand with marketshare  which by extension means advertising is the perfect business model  The more people using Google the more that those fixed costs can be spread out  and the more attractive Google is to advertisers   This is why favoring Android in any way was such a strategic error by Google  everything about the company was predicated on serving all customers  but Android by definition would only ever be on a percentage of smartphones  Again  it s possible Apple would have built its own Maps product regardless  but Google s short sighted favoring of Android ensured that for hundreds of millions of potential Google users the default mapping experience and the treasure trove of data that came with it would belong to someone else   This is where that infamous Gundotra speech matters  I m not convinced that anyone at Google fully thought through the implication of favoring Android with their services  Rather  the Android team was fully committed to competing with iOS   as they should have been    and human nature ensured that the rest of Google came along for the ride  Remember  given Google s business model  winning marketshare was perfectly correlated with reaping outsized profits  it is easy to see how the thinking and culture that developed around Google s core business failed to adjust to the zero sum world of physical devices  And so  as that Gundotra speech exemplified  Android winning became synonymous with Google winning  when in fact Android was as much ouroboros as asset   Google s Assistant Problem  In yesterday s keynote  Google CEO Sundar Pichai  after a recounting of tech history that emphasized the PC Web Mobile epochs I described in late 2014  declared that we are moving from a mobile first world to an AI first one  that was the context for the introduction of the Google Assistant   It was a year prior to the aforementioned iOS 6 that Apple first introduced the idea of an assistant in the guise of Siri  for the first time you could  theoretically  compute by voice  It didn t work very well at first  arguably it still doesn t   but the implications for computing generally and Google specifically were profound  voice interaction both expanded where computing could be done  from situations in which you could devote your eyes and hands to your device to effectively everywhere  even as it constrained what you could do  An assistant has to be far more proactive than  for example  a search results page  it s not enough to present possible answers  rather  an assistant needs to give the right answer   This is a welcome shift for Google the technology  from the beginning the search engine has included an  I m Feeling Lucky  button  so confident was Google founder Larry Page that the search engine could deliver you the exact result you wanted  and while yesterday s Google Assistant demos were canned  the results  particularly when it came to contextual awareness  were far more impressive than the other assistants on the market  More broadly  few dispute that Google is a clear leader when it comes to the artificial intelligence and machine learning that underlie their assistant   A business  though  is about more than technology  and Google has two significant shortcomings when it comes to assistants in particular  First  as I explained after this year s Google I O  the company has a go to market gap  assistants are only useful if they are available  which in the case of hundreds of millions of iOS users means downloading and using a separate app  or building the sort of experience that  like Facebook  users will willingly spend extensive amounts of time in    Secondly  though  Google has a business model problem  the  I m Feeling Lucky Button  guaranteed that the search in question would not make Google any money  After all  if a user doesn t have to choose from search results  said user also doesn t have the opportunity to click an ad  thus choosing the winner of the competition Google created between its advertisers for user attention  Google Assistant has the exact same problem  where do the ads go   Google s Shift  Yesterday s announcements from Google seem designed to take on the company s challenges in an assistant centric world head on  For good reason the presentation opened with the Google Assistant itself  pure technology has always been the foundation of Google s power in the marketplace   Today s world  though  is not one of  somewhat  standards based browsers that treat every web page the same  creating the conditions for Google s superior technology to become the door to the Internet  it is one of closed ecosystems centered around hardware or social networks  and having failed at the latter  Google is having a go at the former  To put it more generously  Google has adopted Alan Kay s maxim that  People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware   To that end the company introduced multiple hardware devices  including a new phone  the previously announced Google Home device  new Chromecasts  and a new VR headset  Needless to say  all make it far easier to use Google services than any 3rd party OEM does  much less Apple s iPhone   What is even more interesting is that Google has also introduced a new business model  the Pixel phone starts at  649  the same as an iPhone  and while it will take time for Google to achieve the level of scale and expertise to match Apple s profit margins  the fact there is unquestionably a big margin built in is a profound new direction for the company   The most fascinating point of all  though  is how Google intends to sell the Pixel  the Google Assistant is  at least for now  exclusive to the first true Google phone  delivering a differentiated experience that  at least theoretically  justifies that margin   It is a strategy that certainly sounds familiar  raising the question of whether this is a replay of the turn by turn navigation disaster  Is Google forgetting that they are a horizontal company  one whose business model is designed to maximize reach  not limit it   I don t think so  In fact  I think this profound strategy shift springs from a depth of thinking that is the polar opposite of the hot headedness of the former Android leadership  It is not that Google is artificially constraining its horizontal business model  it is that its business model is being constrained by the reality of a world where  as Pichai noted  artificial intelligence comes first  In that world you must own the interaction point  and there is no room for ads  rendering both Google s distribution and business model moot  Both must change for the company s technological advantage to come to the fore   In this respect Google is like the bizarro Apple  the iPhone maker has the distribution channel and business model to make Siri the dominant assistant in its users  lives  but there are open questions about its technology prowess when it comes to artificial intelligence specifically and services generally  moreover  efforts to improve are fundamentally stymied by the company s device centric culture and organizational structure   Google s culture and organizational structure  meanwhile  are attuned to its old business model  the one that equated marketshare with profitability  and which achieved that market share with a product development approach predicated on iteration and experimentation on top of the positive feedback loop that comes from massive amounts of data   Phones couldn t be more different  the Pixel is what it is  which means it has to be great on day one  and it has to be sold  The first means an organizational structure that delivers on the promise of focused integration  not willy nilly experimentation and iteration  the second means partnerships  and outbound marketing  and a whole bunch of other things that Google has traditionally not valued  Indeed  you could see the disconnect in yesterday s presentation  while Pichai was extremely clear about the company s new direction  the actual product demonstrations quickly devolved into droning technical mumbo jumbo that never bothered to explain why users should care   This is why  much like Apple  I can be both impressed by Google s strategic thinking and yes  courage in facing this new epoch  even as I am a bit bearish about their prospects  technology alone is rarely enough  and the only thing more difficult than changing business models is changing cultures,"[913 476 947 926 173 402 874 791 765 127 412]"

to make a news app experience work  and despite great reviews  I ve failed   So  we re giving up on the Inside com App and focusing 100  of our efforts on a medium that s resulting in much better engagement   email     Click to Tweet  can edit before sending   http   ctt ec 99b4f    Why News Apps Failed  Very few people seem to want a dedicated news app  and while my team poured their heart and soul into building what I think was one of the two or three best news app experiences ever  we couldn t get traction   We got exceptional reviews  great press  featured by Apple  and tons of glorious feedback from users   but we didn t have breakout success   Neither did Circa  Zite  Trov  or Pulse   Some readers that are part of big companies are still chugging along  like Facebook s Paper and Yahoo News Digest  but even those well constructed products are solid but not breakout hits   News apps failed because social networks succeeded   People want to get their news filtered through their social network  It s just easier and more fun to click on news links your friends are sharing than to open a separate app   Intellectually  you would think that people would have a unique app for each experience in their life  photo sharing  news  shopping  socializing  watching video  emailing  chatting  etc  It turns out that with these social platforms surging  many things are consolidating into them   Lesson Learned  Social is eating the world  Photos  video  news  and messaging have folded into social  and we all know that Facebook and Twitter desperately want to pull ecommerce into their platforms  but have failed thus far  even though it has worked in Asia    The App Business is Hard  To build a truly modern app startup at  reasonable scale  you need to have about a dozen folks  two developers for each platform  iOS  Android  and web   a product manager  designer  a CTO  growth marketing  and a couple of business folks  CEO  COO    A dozen people means you re spending around two or three million a year in San Francisco  My back of the envelope math in guessing how much a startup spends is  12k a month  all in  per person in the Bay Area   10k outside the Bay Area   A great hack is to start on just one platform  like most of us do   and spend half that amount  No reason to replicate a product across three platforms before you have one dialed in  That s one thing I would change if doing an App company again  do just one platform until you re growing wildly   Lesson Learned  Master wild growth on just one platform before you launch a second   How to Pivot  A couple of months ago  I looked at everything we were doing and said  what s working best   It turned out that people were opening our email alerts but not our app  So  we looked at the 180 000 emails we had grown over the past couple of years and decided to take the Inside com App experience and put it in an email  essentially  what we did with launchticker com    We segmented our list into people interested in this product and the top 10  of the audience seemed really excited about it  Those people have been opening 50  of the emails we send   and we re sending two summaries a day   In month one of the experiment  January   we added 800 emails to our list   We are almost halfway through month two and we have added 3 900 emails to our list   My thesis is that  while people like to get news through their social network  a significant portion of people would like to have someone write them a high quality  top level summary like the Presidential Daily Brief  which is why we re calling it the Inside Daily Brief    The insane thing about this business is that it takes three people to run  not 12  a writer  a CEO  and a growth marketing hacker   I ve got the first two of those positions filled and I m looking for a growth marketing person right now   If you know someone who wants to help me build the Inside Daily Brief to 1m emails  ping me  They need to understand how to do contests  Mailchimp  social media  metrics  and perhaps some paid marketing   We re thinking of doing Facebook signups    Email me at jason inside com and answer the subject line  How I would grow Inside com   When to Pivot  If everyone trying to do what you re doing dies  and you re still alive  that means one of two things  you figured it out and they didn t  or you re about to die   When examining the market  it became clear to me that  while we were proud of our product  we  like our fellow news apps  were not growing   In startups  if you re not growing  you re dying   It s really that simple   So  we were not growing and our competitors were dying   it was time to get out of Dodge   In Summary  If you re not growing  you re dying  If your competitors are all dying  and you re not growing  you re about to die  If your competitors are all dying  and you re growing  congratulations   you won  If you re going to pivot  look at everything you ve learned and put everything into the most promising  simple piece of your failed business  in our case  our email list   Don t try to do more than one platform at a time  make one work and then go to the next platform

1023,training-dataset/product/1462.txt,product,Want to design a habit forming product  Keep these 5 things in mindYou re in front of your computer with nothing to do  or a lot to do  and you re procrastinating   So you open a new browser tab  type in a single letter  and voila the URL of your favorite website  coughRedditcough  pops up   After reading all the stories on the front page  we started thinking about what makes Reddit and the other products we love so distractingly addictive  While the sources of  addiction  varied  the symptoms and behaviors we observed were startlingly similar across different sites and apps   Related  Picking Nir Eyal s brain about habit forming products  So we asked the team and a couple of other people to tell us the apps and websites they interact with every day  or multiple times a day  And then we listed out all the things about each product that kept people coming back   We rearranged all the common reasons together to figure out the features most of them had in common  Below is what we found to be the 5 secrets to designing an addictive product   1  Everyone wants to feel liked and important  We ve all felt it  and we can t deny that we love it  We re social creatures  and we seek out self validation through social affirmation it s human instinct   Getting a nod of approval  even if it s from strangers through platforms like Reddit  Twitter  Instagram  Facebook  or Pinterest  makes people feel like they matter   And it turns out there s some neuroscience involved  Your brain has a region called the nucleus accumbens that processes the feeling of being rewarded  and it s activated when you receive social acceptance and praise   While some users battle to earn upvotes  Reddit   some are busy composing an impeccable photo to get likes  Instagram   and others are spending their time writing the perfect 140 characters to gain retweets and followers  Twitter    The quest for self validation through social media  2  We get addicted to the anticipation of a potential reward  With each post you make  every notification you receive becomes rich with the promise of possible self validation  This makes getting a new notification more exciting than you d otherwise assume   When you don t know what s behind that notification  you re more excited to find out  It could be a simple but appreciated act  like a friend retweeting your tweet  or it could be a job opportunity through LinkedIn  In many cases  this notification is displayed through a tiny app icon on the top of your phone screen  Life teaches us that it s the little things that matter the most     And the reason for that eagerness is because a lack of a guaranteed reward is far more addictive than one that s assured  The brain is complacent when things are predictable  but the lure of a potential reward will drive it to keep going until it finds one   Based on this behavior  if the reward comes randomly from a variety of sources  the quest for a reward  likely of self validation via likes or retweets  will carry on   3  Our brain loves new things  Ah  dopamine  Dopamine is what our brain releases when it sees something new  and positive   In the  novelty center  of our brain  a region in our midbrain called the substantia nigra ventral segmental area   this neurotransmitter plays a big role in reward motivated behavior which is why we find ourselves constantly refreshing our favorite websites looking for something new   You can see this in the form of news feeds  Facebook   timelines  Twitter  Instagram   front pages  Reddit   and on Tinder   Tinder is the epitome of  new new new   With just a simple swipe  you can browse through what feels like an infinite amount of new profiles  Add to that the first point of self validation  through getting a match   and the second point about the variability of rewards  anticipating what the next swipe will bring you   and Tinder is a perfect example of the combination of all 3 qualities   But if you don t believe us  trust the numbers  Tinder receives 1 4 billion swipes a day   4  It s tough to walk away when you ve invested so much   With the pursuit of self validation  point 1  and the anticipation of a potential reward  point 2   we end up adding photos  posts  and connections into these apps slowly over time  And before we know it  so much has gone into these apps that it becomes something we default to continue using   Facebook is the perfect example of something that s hard for us to walk away from because we ve invested so much time and history into it from years of photos to hundreds of friends  to thousands of posts   Other social media platforms work similarly  Leaving LinkedIn would mean leaving behind the professional network and connections you ve grown  And while Snapchat revolves around snaps with a 24 hour expiration date  why it s addictive needs its own article   Instagram  Twitter  and Pinterest are centered around your photo and tweet history  Again  a compilation of your contributions over time you don t want to lose   And to take it even further  sometimes it s not just about the things you might be leaving behind  but about how

aspiration   We all know the phrase  Instagram worthy   You work to capture the magic of where you re at so you can post it on Instagram after  Why  Because you post inspiring and interesting photos

based on a topic   These groups are typically created  contributed and moderated by the community  Meaning you don t have the standard categories often found elsewhere   Once you re on Reddit  you re shown a curated wall of content based on subreddits you ve subscribed to  And through their upvote downvote system  they ve put the power of keeping high quality content into the hands of their vast

1059,training-dataset/engineering/836.txt,engineering,Mobile web performance anti patternsFor more on optimizing mobile performance  download your free copy of Mobile Performance Tips  Measure and Optimize by Maximiliano Firtman   When it comes to optimizing web performance  mobile devices need a lot of attention  There are several misconceptions among web professionals  from designers to developers and operations staff  that contribute to a diminished user experience  I ll detail these anti patterns below and offer some tips for overcoming the most common mistakes    1 Waiting too long to apply performance optimizations  The first big issue is that teams don t sufficiently prioritize performance from the very early design stages  Performance considerations should be incorporated throughout the whole process by the entire team  not just executed by a small team after the project is done  When you don t think about performance for mobile devices from the start you end up working towards the wrong goals  like using a client side only solution  compared to a server side or mixed side solution  or using client side responsive web design techniques only  Those aren t really goals  they re solutions to problems  When you make performance the goal  you can properly analyze the situation  determine what problems you re facing  and come up with the right solutions to solve them  Stop applying optimizations at the end because often by the end  it s too late    2 Assuming users have 4G  4G users are still a minority worldwide  And about 25  of the time  those minority 4G user connections are being downgraded to 3G  Most people don t understand that even 4G networks have at least 5 times more latency than a home wired connection  This misconception leads companies to ignore network performance as unimportant and to focus instead on mobile screen size and design but to the detriment of most of their customers  actual user experience    3 Using the wrong measurement tools  How do you measure mobile device web performance  It is common just to use a desktop browser  perhaps in mobile emulation mode  with your high speed network connection at home  But this is not enough  For accurate results and useful conclusions  you need to use real devices  not the latest smartphone  and real network data  or at least CPU throttling  to measure mobile performance    4 Misunderstanding the mobile web ecosystem  Most people assume that Android users are on Chrome  and iOS users are on Safari  I m sorry to tell you that is not completely true  and that misconception might be affecting how your users perceive your performance optimizations  According to StatCounter  20  of Android users are on UC Browser  10  are on Opera  9  are on Samsung Internet  and 6  are still on the old Android browser  And the MOVR Report states that 38  of iOS users are browsing within webviews  such as Facebook s or Twitter s in app browser  which is not exactly Safari  When you don t understand the ecosystem  you don t test  measure and optimize for the real targets out there  and you might be making the wrong conclusions about performance goal achievements    5 Poor image optimization  Typical problems you ll encounter when delivering resources to mobile devices have to do with responsive images  not optimizing images enough  and sending more bytes than necessary  If a device has a 4K screen  should you send a 4K image over a cellular network  Is it worth it  It s incredible how poor the typical image optimization is today  Take advantage of new compression algorithms and formats  Client Hints  visual appearance  and compression    6 Underestimating JavaScript  third party scripts  and web fonts  Just because it renders properly on desktop doesn t mean it s okay for a cheap Android phone on a 3G network  This goes for JavaScript  third party scripts  and web fonts  Most designers are underestimating the effect that web fonts have on the above the fold content  and are not optimizing the files  Removing unused characters or reducing glyphs  for example  can go a long way towards improvement    7 Misunderstanding HTTP 1 1 vs HTTP 2 performance  Some tricks that were suggested in the HTTP 1 1 era to reduce requests  such as using image sprites  become anti patterns when you start serving on HTTP 2  However  saying that every trick on HTTP 2 is now an anti pattern  is also an anti pattern  For example  Khan Academy found that bundling JavaScript files is still a good idea on HTTP 2  If you ve recently made the jump to HTTP 2  or are planning to soon  be sure you investigate and address the potential mobile performance implications   Mobile needs special attention  Knowing that 55  of web traffic comes from a mobile device or tablet should motivate you to pay special attention to these devices and make mobile web performance a priority  Your goal is not to be responsive  or to use the latest client side framework  your real goal is positive user perception  and for that you need to make performance optimization part of the whole process from design to development for the whole team  To

1069,training-dataset/product/1117.txt,product,Understanding User Psychology  Thinking Like a Game DesignerAchievers  Explorers  Socializers  Killers  Achievement  Envy  Ownership  Progression  Status  Collection  Blissful Productivity  Appointment  Cascading Information  Epic Meaning   This is the third post in myseries  If you haven t already  make sure to check out Meet Your Happy Chemicals and The Psychology of Persuasion   When looking to understand user psychology to design better product experiences  one of the richest sources of knowledge exists within the game design world  Game designers have been refining their techniques for decades to build ever more engaging and enjoyable experiences that drive specific player behavior  Their techniques are rooted in a deep understanding of player psychology and have built an incredible set of mechanics that they repeatably leverage to design addicting games Today I wanted to provide an overview of some of the tenants of game design and particular game mechanics that can be leveraged to drive user behavior in any digital product Game design always starts with an understanding of player motivation  Motivation ultimately breaks down into two categories  intrinsic and extrinsic motivation  Intrinsic motivation drives someone to perform a task for the enjoyment of the task itself  Daniel Pink is the leading expert on intrinsic motivation  who breaks it down to autonomy  mastery  and purpose  Everyone agrees intrinsic motivation is the better kind of motivation and one needs to ensure that there is some intrinsic motivation in the first place for why someone is using your game or app Extrinsic motivation  on the other hand  drives someone to perform a task simply for an external reward or to avoid punishment  Extrinsic motivation is what game designers take advantage of to design enjoyable games and we ll see exactly how they do so through a variety of game mechanics Beyond simple motivation  game designers recognize that players come to a game with their own personality types seeking different kinds of enjoyment  It s important to recognize this and creates experiences that allow each of the player types to thrive in the game  Player types are classically divided into four categories enjoy gaining points  levels  equipment and other concrete measurements of succeeding in a game  They will go to great lengths to achieve rewards that confer minimal gameplay benefit simply for the prestige of having it enjoy discovering areas  creating maps and learning about hidden places  They love to take their time to explore new areas and look around at their own pace enjoy interacting with other players  and on some occasions  computer controlled characters with personality  The game is merely a tool they use to meet others in game or outside of it enjoy competition with other players and are there to win against their peers By understanding the different player types within your game  a game designer can build experiences that create extrinsic motivation for each of these player types  Game designers have established a set of best practices for doing so  which manifest in individual game mechanics they choose to leverage to drive enjoyment and desired behavior out of their users Let s take a look at ten popular game mechanics The achievement mechanic enables players to earn achievements  which are virtual or physical representations of having accomplished something  These are often viewed by players as rewards in and of themselves Games with badges  levels  rewards  and points are all examples of the achievement mechanic  We equally see such badges and levels used in apps like Foursquare  fitness apps  and more The envy mechanic creates an experience where a player desires to have something that another player already has  In order for this to be effective  a player needs to be able to see what other players have  voyeurism  Allowing players to showcase their badges  levels to other players  allowing players to visit each other s farms in FarmVille  and leaderboards in general are all examples of experiences that create envy  The reality is all social products with profile and status updates inevitably create some level of envy with others through voyeurism The ownership mechanic allows players to control something or have it as their property  which they take pride in having Controlling parts of a game board or owning a vast army are game examples of this mechanic  Simply  owning  popularity by having a large digital representation of many friends is the equivalent of this on social products The progression mechanic displays success granularly and is measured through the process of completing itemized tasks Leveling up your player from 1 to 60 is the classic example of the progression mechanic  Any kind of progress bar you create in an product or service is how this often manifests outside of games The status mechanic enables you to have a rank or level in a game that confers status in the eyes of the player and others Being able to brag to your friends about your white paladin level 20 in WOW is the status mechanic at play  Github conveys the status of developers on their developer profiles by visualizing and summarizing their contributions across various open source projects The collection mechanic enables players to create a collection of items  whether they are achievements  resources  or anything else in the game Collecting resources and badges are the classic game examples of this  The central action on Pinterest of pinning various visuals into your pin board is also a great example of the collection mechanic at work The blissful productivity mechanic takes advantage of the idea that playing a game can make you happier working hard  than you would be relaxing  Essentially  we re optimized as human beings by working hard  and doing meaningful and rewarding work Grinding in WoW is the classic example of blissful productivity  Oftentimes when we are building app experiences we try to make things as easy as possible to avoid our users having to do work  But what s equally important is enabling experiences that get them in a state of blissful productivity  encouraging them to do work in our apps quite willingly  It still amazes me the relatively small set of contributors that maintain all of Wikipedia  a great example of blissful productivity The appointment mechanic requires that to succeed  one must return at a predefined time to take some action  Appointment mechanics are often deeply related to interval based reward schedules Farmville requires you to come back to the game at a set time to water your plants or they will wither away  Happy Hours are a real world example of the appointment mechanic at work The cascading information mechanic releases information in the minimum possible snippets in order to allow players to gain the appropriate level of understanding at each point during a game narrative Games typically show basic actions first  unlocking more as you progress through levels  Well designed app on boarding experiences follow this same mechanic as opposed to putting all product education up front The epic meaning mechanic takes advantage of the idea that players will be highly motivated if they believe they are working to achieve something great  something awe inspiring  something bigger than themselves Warcraft s ongoing story line has epic meaning to many of it s players  creating such deep engagement with players both inside and outside of the game  When you can tie the usage of your product or service to such an epic meaning  you ll find significantly higher motivation  May open source developers contribute to open source projects for this very reason I hope this gives you a glimpse of how game designers think through driving extrinsic motivation for their various player types through a variety of established game mechanics  Next time you design a product experience  take a moment to think through whether there are applicable game mechanics that might enable you to accelerate your desired behavior from your user For those interested  I d encourage you to read more from a thought leader and expert in game design  Amy Jo Kim,"[1069 594 1286 294 135 780 822 1318 411 252 1302]"
1074,training-dataset/business/1327.txt,business,Manifestos and Monopolies   Stratechery by Ben ThompsonIt is certainly possible that  as per recent speculation  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is preparing to run for President  It is also possible that Facebook is on the verge of failing  just like MySpace   And while I m here  it s possible that UFOs exist  I doubt it  though   The reality is that Facebook is one of the most powerful companies the tech industry   and arguably  the world   has ever seen  True  everything posted on Facebook is put there for free  either by individuals or professional content creators  and true  Facebook isn t really irreplaceable when it comes to the generation of economic value  and it is also true that there are all kinds of alternatives when it comes to communication  However  to take these truths as evidence that Facebook is fragile requires a view of the world that is increasingly archaic   Start with production  there certainly was a point in human history when economic power was derived through the control of resources and the production of scarce goods   However  for most products this has not been the case for well over a century  first the industrial revolution and then the advent of the assembly line method of manufacturing resulted in an abundance of products  The new source of economic power became distribution  the ability to get those mass produced products in front of customers who were inclined to buy them   Today the fundamental impact of the Internet is to make distribution itself a cheap commodity   or in the case of digital content  completely free  And that  by extension  is why I have long argued that the Internet Revolution is as momentous as the Industrial Revolution  it is transforming how and where economic value is generated  and thus where power resides   In this brave new world  power comes not from production  not from distribution  but from controlling consumption  all markets will be demand driven  the extent to which they already are is a function of how digitized they have become   This is why most Facebook fail fundamentalists so badly miss the point  that the company pays nothing for its content is not a weakness  it is a reflection of the fundamental reality that the supply of content  and increasingly goods  is infinite  and thus worthless  that the company is not essential to the distribution of products is not a measure of its economic importance  or lack thereof  but a reflection that distribution is no longer a differentiator  And last of all  the fact that communication is possible on other platforms is to ignore the fact that communication will always be easiest on Facebook  because they own the social graph  Combine that with the fact that controlling consumption is about controlling billions of individual consumers  all of whom will  all things being equal  choose the easy option  and you start to appreciate just how dominant Facebook is   Given this reality  why would Zuckerberg want to be President  He is not only the CEO of Facebook  he is the dominant shareholder as well  answerable to no one  His power and ability to influence is greater than any President subject to political reality and check and balances  and besides  as Zuckerberg made clear last week  his concern is not a mere country but rather the entire world   Facebook Unease  The argument that Facebook is more powerful than most realize is not a new one on Stratechery  in 2015 I wrote The Facebook Epoch that made similar points about just how underrated Facebook was  particularly in Silicon Valley  In my role as an analyst I can t help but be impressed  I have probably written more positive pieces about Facebook than just about any other company  and frankly  still will   And yet  if you were to take a military type approach to analysis   evaluating Facebook based on capabilities  not intent   the company is  for the exact same reasons  rather terrifying  Last year in The Voters Decide I wrote   Given their power over what users see Facebook could  if it chose  be the most potent political force in the world  Until  of course  said meddling was uncovered  at which point the service  having so significantly betrayed trust  would lose a substantial number of users and thus its lucrative and privileged place in advertising  leading to a plunge in market value  In short  there are no incentives for Facebook to explicitly favor any type of content beyond that which drives deeper engagement  all evidence suggests that is exactly what the service does   The furor last May over Facebook s alleged tampering with the Trending Topics box   and Facebook s overwrought reaction to even the suggestion of explicit bias   seemed to confirm that Facebook s incentives were such that the company would never become overtly political  To be sure  algorithms are written by humans  which means they will always have implicit bias  and the focus on engagement has its own harms  particularly the creation of filter bubbles and fake news  but I have long viewed Facebook s use for explicit political ends to be the greatest danger of all   This is why I read Zuckerberg s manifesto  Building a Global Community  with such alarm  Zuckerberg not only gives his perspective on how the world is changing   and  at least in passing  some small admission that Facebook s focus on engagement may have driven things like filter bubbles and fake news   but for the first time explicitly commits Facebook to playing a central role in effecting that change in a manner that aligns with Zuckerberg s personal views on the world  Zuckerberg writes   This is a time when many of us around the world are reflecting on how we can have the most positive impact  I am reminded of my favorite saying about technology   We always overestimate what we can do in two years  and we underestimate what we can do in ten years   We may not have the power to create the world we want immediately  but we can all start working on the long term today  In times like these  the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us  For the past decade  Facebook has focused on connecting friends and families  With that foundation  our next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community   for supporting us  for keeping us safe  for informing us  for civic engagement  and for inclusion of all   It all sounds so benign  and given Zuckerberg s framing of the disintegration of institutions that held society together  helpful  even  And one can even argue that just as the industrial revolution shifted political power from localized fiefdoms and cities to centralized nation states  the Internet revolution will  perhaps  require a shift in political power to global entities  That seems to be Zuckerberg s position   Our greatest opportunities are now global   like spreading prosperity and freedom  promoting peace and understanding  lifting people out of poverty  and accelerating science  Our greatest challenges also need global responses   like ending terrorism  fighting climate change  and preventing pandemics  Progress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations  but also as a global community   There s just one problem  first  Zuckerberg may be wrong  it s just as plausible to argue that the ultimate end state of the Internet Revolution is a devolution of power to smaller more responsive self selected entities  And  even if Zuckerberg is right  is there anyone who believes that a private company run by an unaccountable all powerful person that tracks your every move for the purpose of selling advertising is the best possible form said global governance should take   The Cost of Monopoly  My deep rooted suspicion of Zuckerberg s manifesto has nothing to do with Facebook or Zuckerberg  I suspect that we agree on more political goals than not  Rather  my discomfort arises from my strong belief that centralized power is both inefficient and dangerous  no one person  or company  can figure out optimal solutions for everyone on their own  and history is riddled with examples of central planners ostensibly acting with the best of intentions   at least in their own minds   resulting in the most horrific of consequences  those consequences sometimes take the form of overt costs  both economic and humanitarian  and sometimes those costs are foregone opportunities and innovations  Usually it s both   Facebook is already problematic for society when it comes to opportunity costs  While the Internet   specifically  the removal of distribution as a bottleneck   is the cause of journalism s woes  it is Facebook that has gobbled up all of the profits in publishing  Twitter  a service I believe is both unique and essential  was squashed by Facebook  I suspect the company s struggles for viability are at the root of the service s inability to evolve or deal with abuse  Even Snapchat  led by the most visionary product person tech has seen in years  has serious questions about its long term viability  Facebook is too dominant  its network effects are too strong  and its data on every user on the Internet too compelling to the advertisers other consumer serving businesses need to be viable entities   I don t necessarily begrudge Facebook this dominance  as I alluded to above I myself have benefited from chronicling it  Zuckerberg identified a market opportunity  ruthlessly exploited it with superior execution  had the humility to buy when necessary and the audacity to copy well  and has deservedly profited in the face of continual skepticism  And further  as I noted  as long as Facebook was governed by the profit maximization incentive  I was willing to tolerate the company s unintended consequences  whatever steps would be necessary to undo the company s dominance  particularly if initiated by governments  would have their own unintended consequences  And besides  as we saw with IBM and Windows  markets are far more effective than governments at tearing down the ecosystem based monopolies they enable   in part because the pursuit of profit maximizing strategies is a key ingredient of disruption   That  though  is why for me this manifesto crosses the line  contra Spider Man  Facebook s great power does not entail great responsibility  said power ought to entail the refusal to apply it  no matter how altruistic the aims  and barring that  it is on the rest of us to act in opposition   Limiting Facebook  Of course it is one thing to point out the problems with Facebook s dominance  but it s quite another to come up with a strategy for dealing with it  too many of the solutions   including demands that Zuckerberg use Facebook for political ends   are less concerned with the abuse of power and more with securing said power for the  right  causes  And  from the opposite side  it s not clear that a traditional antitrust is even possible for companies governed by Aggregation Theory  as I explained last year in Antitrust and Aggregation   To briefly recap  Aggregation Theory is about how business works in a world with zero distribution costs and zero transaction costs  consumers are attracted to an aggregator through the delivery of a superior experience  which attracts modular suppliers  which improves the experience and thus attracts more consumers  and thus more suppliers in the aforementioned virtuous cycle  The first key antitrust implication of Aggregation Theory is that  thanks to these virtuous cycles  the big get bigger  indeed  all things being equal the equilibrium state in a market covered by Aggregation Theory is monopoly  one aggregator that has captured all of the consumers and all of the suppliers  This monopoly  though  is a lot different than the monopolies of yesteryear  aggregators aren t limiting consumer choice by controlling supply  like oil  or distribution  like railroads  or infrastructure  like telephone wires   rather  consumers are self selecting onto the Aggregator s platform because it s a better experience   Facebook is a particularly thorny case  because the company has multiple lock ins  on one hand  as per Aggregation Theory  Facebook has completely modularized and commoditized content suppliers desperate to reach Facebook s massive user base  it s a two sided market in which suppliers are completely powerless  But so are users  thanks to Facebook s network effects  the number one feature of any social network is whether or not your friends or family are using it  and everyone uses Facebook  even if they also use another social network as well    To that end  Facebook should not be allowed to buy another network based app  I would go further and make it prima facie anticompetitive for one social network to buy another  Network effects are just too powerful to allow them to be combined  For example  the current environment would look a lot different if Facebook didn t own Instagram or WhatsApp  and  should Facebook ever lose an antitrust lawsuit  the remedy would almost certainly be spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp    Secondly  all social networks should be required to enable social graph portability   the ability to export your lists of friends from one network to another  Again Instagram is the perfect example  the one time photo filtering app launched its network off the back of Twitter by enabling the wholesale import of your Twitter social graph  And  after it was acquired by Facebook  Instagram has only accelerated its growth by continually importing your Facebook network  Today all social networks have long since made this impossible  making it that much more difficult for competitors to arise   Third  serious attention should be given to Facebook s data collection on individuals  As a rule I don t have any problem with advertising  or even data collection  but Facebook is so pervasive that it is all but impossible for individuals to opt out in any meaningful way  which further solidifies Facebook s growing dominance of digital advertising   Anyone who has read Stratechery for any length of time knows I have great reservations about regulation  the benefits are easy to measure  but the opportunity costs are both invisible and often far greater  That  though  is why I am also concerned about Facebook s dominance  there are significant opportunity costs to the social network s dominance  Even then  my trepidation about any sort of intervention is vast  and that leads me back to Zuckerberg s manifesto  it s bad enough for Facebook to have so much power  but the very suggestion that Zuckerberg might utilize it for political ends raises the costs of inaction from not just opportunity costs to overt ones   Moreover  my proposals are in line with Zuckerberg s proclaimed goals  if the Facebook CEO truly wants to foster new kinds of communities  then he ought to unleash the force that can best build the tools those disparate communities might need  That  of course  is the market  and Facebook s social graph is the key  That Zuckerberg believes Facebook can do it alone is evidence enough that for Zuckerberg  saving the world is at best a close second to saving Facebook  the last thing we need are unaccountable leaders who put their personal interests above those they purport to govern,"[1074 765 1375 146 1256 780 1166 1023 217 1383 462]"

Google s Design Ethicist  Estimated reading time  12 minutes    It s easier to fool people than to convince them that they ve been fooled     Unknown   I m an expert on how technology hijacks our psychological vulnerabilities  That s why I spent the last three years as a Design Ethicist at Google caring about how to design things in a way that defends a billion people s minds from getting hijacked   When using technology  we often focus optimistically on all the things it does for us  But I want to show you where it might do the opposite   Where does technology exploit our minds  weaknesses   I learned to think this way when I was a magician  Magicians start by looking for blind spots  edges  vulnerabilities and limits of people s perception  so they can influence what people do without them even realizing it  Once you know how to push people s buttons  you can play them like a piano   That s me performing sleight of hand magic at my mother s birthday party  And this is exactly what product designers do to your mind  They play your psychological vulnerabilities  consciously and unconsciously  against you in the race to grab your attention   I want to show you how they do it   Hijack  1  If You Control the Menu  You Control the Choices  Western Culture is built around ideals of individual choice and freedom  Millions of us fiercely defend our right to make  free  choices  while we ignore how those choices are manipulated upstream by menus we didn t choose in the first place   This is exactly what magicians do  They give people the illusion of free choice while architecting the menu so that they win  no matter what you choose  I can t emphasize enough how deep this insight is   When people are given a menu of choices  they rarely ask    what s not on the menu     why am I being given these options and not others     do I know the menu provider s goals     is this menu empowering for my original need  or are the choices actually a distraction    e g  an overwhelmingly array of toothpastes   How empowering is this menu of choices for the need   I ran out of toothpaste    For example  imagine you re out with friends on a Tuesday night and want to keep the conversation going  You open Yelp to find nearby recommendations and see a list of bars  The group turns into a huddle of faces staring down at their phones comparing bars  They scrutinize the photos of each  comparing cocktail drinks  Is this menu still relevant to the original desire of the group   It s not that bars aren t a good choice  it s that Yelp substituted the group s original question   where can we go to keep talking    with a different question   what s a bar with good photos of cocktails    all by shaping the menu   Moreover  the group falls for the illusion that Yelp s menu represents a complete set of choices for where to go  While looking down at their phones  they don t see the park across the street with a band playing live music  They miss the pop up gallery on the other side of the street serving crepes and coffee  Neither of those show up on Yelp s menu   Yelp subtly reframes the group s need  where can we go to keep talking   in terms of photos of cocktails served   The more choices technology gives us in nearly every domain of our lives  information  events  places to go  friends  dating  jobs    the more we assume that our phone is always the most empowering and useful menu to pick from  Is it   The  most empowering  menu is different than the menu that has the most choices  But when we blindly surrender to the menus we re given  it s easy to lose track of the difference    Who s free tonight to hang out   becomes a menu of most recent people who texted us  who we could ping     What s happening in the world   becomes a menu of news feed stories    Who s single to go on a date   becomes a menu of faces to swipe on Tinder  instead of local events with friends  or urban adventures nearby     I have to respond to this email   becomes a menu of keys to type a response  instead of empowering ways to communicate with a person    All user interfaces are menus  What if your email client gave you empowering choices of ways to respond  instead of  what message do you want to type back    Design by Tristan Harris   When we wake up in the morning and turn our phone over to see a list of notifications   it frames the experience of  waking up in the morning  around a menu of  all the things I ve missed since yesterday    for more examples  see Joe Edelman s Empowering Design talk   A list of notifications when we wake up in the morning   how empowering is this menu of choices when we wake up  Does it reflect what we care about   from Joe Edelman s Empowering Design Talk   By shaping the menus we pick from  technology hijacks the way we perceive our choices and replaces them with new ones  But the closer we pay attention to the options we re given  the more we ll notice when they don t actually align with our true needs   Hijack  2  Put a Slot Machine In a Billion Pockets  If you re an app  how do you keep people hooked  Turn yourself into a slot machine   The average person checks their phone 150 times a day  Why do we do this  Are we making 150 conscious choices   How often do you check your email per day   One major reason why is the  1 psychological ingredient in slot machines  intermittent variable rewards   If you want to maximize addictiveness  all tech designers need to do is link a user s action  like pulling a lever  with a variable reward  You pull a lever and immediately receive either an enticing reward  a match  a prize   or nothing  Addictiveness is maximized when the rate of reward is most variable   Does this effect really work on people  Yes  Slot machines make more money in the United States than baseball  movies  and theme parks combined  Relative to other kinds of gambling  people get  problematically involved  with slot machines 3 4x faster according to NYU professor Natasha Dow Schull  author of Addiction by Design   But here s the unfortunate truth   several billion people have a slot machine their pocket   When we pull our phone out of our pocket  we re playing a slot machine to see what notifications we got   When we pull to refresh our email  we re playing a slot machine to see what new email we got   When we swipe down our finger to scroll the Instagram feed  we re playing a slot machine to see what photo comes next   When we swipe faces left right on dating apps like Tinder  we re playing a slot machine to see if we got a match   When we tap the   of red notifications  we re playing a slot machine to what s underneath   Apps and websites sprinkle intermittent variable rewards all over their products because it s good for business   But in other cases  slot machines emerge by accident  For example  there is no malicious corporation behind all of email who consciously chose to make it a slot machine  No one profits when millions check their email and nothing s there  Neither did Apple and Google s designers want phones to work like slot machines  It emerged by accident   But now companies like Apple and Google have a responsibility to reduce these effects by converting intermittent variable rewards into less addictive  more predictable ones with better design  For example  they could empower people to set predictable times during the day or week for when they want to check  slot machine  apps  and correspondingly adjust when new messages are delivered to align with those times   Hijack  3  Fear of Missing Something Important  FOMSI   Another way apps and websites hijack people s minds is by inducing a  1  chance you could be missing something important    If I convince you that I m a channel for important information  messages  friendships  or potential sexual opportunities   it will be hard for you to turn me off  unsubscribe  or remove your account   because  aha  I win  you might miss something important   This keeps us subscribed to newsletters even after they haven t delivered recent benefits   what if I miss a future announcement     This keeps us  friended  to people with whom we haven t spoke in ages   what if I miss something important from them     This keeps us swiping faces on dating apps  even when we haven t even met up with anyone in a while   what if I miss that one hot match who likes me     This keeps us using social media   what if I miss that important news story or fall behind what my friends are talking about     But if we zoom into that fear  we ll discover that it s unbounded  we ll always miss something important at any point when we stop using something   There are magic moments on Facebook we ll miss by not using it for the 6th hour  e g  an old friend who s visiting town right now    There are magic moments we ll miss on Tinder  e g  our dream romantic partner  by not swiping our 700th match   There are emergency phone calls we ll miss if we re not connected 24 7   But living moment to moment with the fear of missing something isn t how we re built to live   And it s amazing how quickly  once we let go of that fear  we wake up from the illusion  When we unplug for more than a day  unsubscribe from those notifications  or go to Camp Grounded   the concerns we thought we d have don t actually happen   We don t miss what we don t see   The thought   what if I miss something important   is generated in advance of unplugging  unsubscribing  or turning off   not after  Imagine if tech companies recognized that  and helped us proactively tune our relationships with friends and businesses in terms of what we define as  time well spent  for our lives  instead of in terms of what we might miss   Hijack  4  Social Approval  Easily one of the most persuasive things a human being can receive   We re all vulnerable to social approval  The need to belong  to be approved or appreciated by our peers is among the highest human motivations  But now our social approval is in the hands of tech companies   When I get tagged by my friend Marc  I imagine him making a conscious choice to tag me  But I don t see how a company like Facebook orchestrated his doing that in the first place   Facebook  Instagram or SnapChat can manipulate how often people get tagged in photos by automatically suggesting all the faces people should tag  e g  by showing a box with a 1 click confirmation   Tag Tristan in this photo      So when Marc tags me  he s actually responding to Facebook s suggestion  not making an independent choice  But through design choices like this  Facebook controls the multiplier for how often millions of people experience their social approval on the line   Facebook uses automatic suggestions like this to get people to tag more people  creating more social externalities and interruptions   The same happens when we change our main profile photo   Facebook knows that s a moment when we re vulnerable to social approval   what do my friends think of my new pic   Facebook can rank this higher in the news feed  so it sticks around for longer and more friends will like or comment on it  Each time they like or comment on it  we ll get pulled right back   Everyone innately responds to social approval  but some demographics  teenagers  are more vulnerable to it than others  That s why it s so important to recognize how powerful designers are when they exploit this vulnerability   Hijack  5  Social Reciprocity  Tit for tat   You do me a favor   I owe you one next time   You say   thank you   I have to say  you re welcome    You send me an email  it s rude not to get back to you   You follow me   it s rude not to follow you back   especially for teenagers   We are vulnerable to needing to reciprocate others  gestures  But as with Social Approval  tech companies now manipulate how often we experience it   In some cases  it s by accident  Email  texting and messaging apps are social reciprocity factories  But in other cases  companies exploit this vulnerability on purpose   LinkedIn is the most obvious offender  LinkedIn wants as many people creating social obligations for each other as possible  because each time they reciprocate  by accepting a connection  responding to a message  or endorsing someone back for a skill  they have to come back to linkedin com where they can get people to spend more time   Like Facebook  LinkedIn exploits an asymmetry in perception  When you receive an invitation from someone to connect  you imagine that person making a conscious choice to invite you  when in reality  they likely unconsciously responded to LinkedIn s list of suggested contacts  In other words  LinkedIn turns your unconscious impulses  to  add  a person  into new social obligations that millions of people feel obligated to repay  All while they profit from the time people spend doing it   Imagine millions of people getting interrupted like this throughout their day  running around like chickens with their heads cut off  reciprocating each other   all designed by companies who profit from it   Welcome to social media   After accepting an endorsement  LinkedIn takes advantage of your bias to reciprocate by offering  four  additional people for you to endorse in return   Imagine if technology companies had a responsibility to minimize social reciprocity  Or if there was an independent organization that represented the public s interests   an industry consortium or an FDA for tech   that monitored when technology companies abused these biases   Hijack  6  Bottomless bowls  Infinite Feeds  and Autoplay  YouTube autoplays the next video after a countdown  Another way to hijack people is to keep them consuming things  even when they aren t hungry anymore   How  Easy  Take an experience that was bounded and finite  and turn it into a bottomless flow that keeps going   Cornell professor Brian Wansink demonstrated this in his study showing you can trick people into keep eating soup by giving them a bottomless bowl that automatically refills as they eat  With bottomless bowls  people eat 73  more calories than those with normal bowls and underestimate how many calories they ate by 140 calories   Tech companies exploit the same principle  News feeds are purposely designed to auto refill with reasons to keep you scrolling  and purposely eliminate any reason for you to pause  reconsider or leave   It s also why video and social media sites like Netflix  YouTube or Facebook autoplay the next video after a countdown instead of waiting for you to make a conscious choice  in case you won t   A huge portion of traffic on these websites is driven by autoplaying the next thing   Facebook autoplays the next video after a countdown  Tech companies often claim that  we re just making it easier for users to see the video they want to watch  when they are actually serving their business interests  And you can t blame them  because increasing  time spent  is the currency they compete for   Instead  imagine if technology companies empowered you to consciously bound your experience to align with what would be  time well spent  for you  Not just bounding the quantity of time you spend  but the qualities of what would be  time well spent    Hijack  7  Instant Interruption vs   Respectful  Delivery  Companies know that messages that interrupt people immediately are more persuasive at getting people to respond than messages delivered asynchronously  like email or any deferred inbox    Given the choice  Facebook Messenger  or WhatsApp  WeChat or SnapChat for that matter  would prefer to design their messaging system to interrupt recipients immediately  and show a chat box  instead of helping users respect each other s attention   In other words  interruption is good for business   It s also in their interest to heighten the feeling of urgency and social reciprocity  For example  Facebook automatically tells the sender when you  saw  their message  instead of letting you avoid disclosing whether you read it   now that you know I ve seen the message  I feel even more obligated to respond     By contrast  Apple more respectfully lets users toggle  Read Receipts  on or off   The problem is  maximizing interruptions in the name of business creates a tragedy of the commons  ruining global attention spans and causing billions of unnecessary interruptions each day  This is a huge problem we need to fix with shared design standards  potentially  as part of Time Well Spent    Hijack  8  Bundling Your Reasons with Their Reasons  Another way apps hijack you is by taking your reasons for visiting the app  to perform a task  and make them inseparable from the app s business reasons  maximizing how much we consume once we re there    For example  in the physical world of grocery stores  the  1 and  2 most popular reasons to visit are pharmacy refills and buying milk  But grocery stores want to maximize how much people buy  so they put the pharmacy and the milk at the back of the store   In other words  they make the thing customers want  milk  pharmacy  inseparable from what the business wants  If stores were truly organized to support people  they would put the most popular items in the front   Tech companies design their websites the same way  For example  when you you want to look up a Facebook event happening tonight  your reason  the Facebook app doesn t allow you to access it without first landing on the news feed  their reasons   and that s on purpose  Facebook wants to convert every reason you have for using Facebook  into their reason which is to maximize the time you spend consuming things   Instead  imagine if    Twitter gave you a separate way to post an Tweet than having to see their news feed   Facebook gave a separate way to look up Facebook Events going on tonight  without being forced to use their news feed   Facebook gave you a separate way to use Facebook Connect as a passport for creating new accounts on 3rd party apps and websites  without being forced to install Facebook s entire app  news feed and notifications   In a Time Well Spent world  there is always a direct way to get what you want separately from what businesses want  Imagine a digital  bill of rights  outlining design standards that forced the products used by billions of people to let them navigate directly to what they want without needing to go through intentionally placed distractions   Imagine if web browsers empowered you to navigate directly to what you want   especially for sites that intentionally detour you toward their reasons   Hijack  9  Inconvenient Choices  We re told that it s enough for businesses to  make choices available     If you don t like it you can always use a different product     If you don t like it  you can always unsubscribe     If you re addicted to our app  you can always uninstall it from your phone    Businesses naturally want to make the choices they want you to make easier  and the choices they don t want you to make harder  Magicians do the same thing  You make it easier for a spectator to pick the thing you want them to pick  and harder to pick the thing you don t   For example  NYTimes com lets you  make a free choice  to cancel your digital subscription  But instead of just doing it when you hit  Cancel Subscription   they send you an email with information on how to cancel your account by calling a phone number that s only open at certain times   NYTimes claims it s giving a free choice to cancel your account  Instead of viewing the world in terms of availability of choices  we should view the world in terms of friction required to enact choices  Imagine a world where choices were labeled with how difficult they were to fulfill  like coefficients of friction  and there was an independent entity   an industry consortium or non profit   that labeled these difficulties and set standards for how easy navigation should be   Hijack  10  Forecasting Errors   Foot in the Door  strategies  Facebook promises an easy choice to  See Photo   Would we still click if it gave the true price tag   Lastly  apps can exploit people s inability to forecast the consequences of a click   People don t intuitively forecast the true cost of a click when it s presented to them  Sales people use  foot in the door  techniques by asking for a small innocuous request to begin with   just one click to see which tweet got retweeted   and escalate from there   why don t you stay awhile     Virtually all engagement websites use this trick   Imagine if web browsers and smartphones  the gateways through which people make these choices  were truly watching out for people and helped them forecast the consequences of clicks  based on real data about what benefits and costs it actually had     That s why I add  Estimated reading time  to the top of my posts  When you put the  true cost  of a choice in front of people  you re treating your users or audience with dignity and respect  In a Time Well Spent internet  choices could be framed in terms of projected cost and benefit  so people were empowered to make informed choices by default  not by doing extra work   TripAdvisor uses a  foot in the door  technique by asking for a single click review   How many stars    while hiding the three page survey of questions behind the click   Summary And How We Can Fix This  Are you upset that technology hijacks your agency  I am too  I ve listed a few techniques but there are literally thousands  Imagine whole bookshelves  seminars  workshops and trainings that teach aspiring tech entrepreneurs techniques like these  Imagine hundreds of engineers whose job every day is to invent new ways to keep you hooked   The ultimate freedom is a free mind  and we need technology that s on our team to help us live  feel  think and act freely   We need our smartphones  notifications screens and web browsers to be exoskeletons for our minds and interpersonal relationships that put our values  not our impulses  first  People s time is valuable  And we should protect it with the same rigor as privacy and other digital rights   Tristan Harris was a Product Philosopher at Google until 2016 where he studied how technology affects a billion people s attention  wellbeing and

1170,training-dataset/business/803.txt,business,Platform Strategy   by Sangeet Paul ChoudaryThe title of this post may sound contradictory to a lot of my work that focuses on creating a playbook to identify structural patterns for planning  strategy  and policy for platforms  While platforms require careful strategy and planning  a lot of platform evolution defies best laid plans by virtue of the fact that user behavior on platforms is emergent  After writing a detailed section  Section 2  Platform Scale  on the design and planning of platforms in my first book  Platform Scale  I had caveated  in the final chapter of the section  that much of platform evolution depends on emergence  Much like Lego  you can lay out the building blocks  but the configurations that emerge can take the platform in new directions  If you d like to read more about it  you should refer my earlier article on the TRIE framework which essentially posits that the platform manager can define the tools of interaction and the rules of engagement but the definition of the end user experience is owned by the users  unlike a product or a service where the owner defines the end user experience    In anticipation of my upcoming book Platform Revolution in March  I was recently interviewed by Brook Manville on Forbes  Brook pushed on certain aspects of my thinking on platforms and brought back the topic of emergence from another angle  While this is an issue I explore in more detail in my upcoming book  the key issue that we discussed was the difference between three terms that are often used interchangeably  markets  ecosystems  and communities   The following is a relevant extract from the interview    Platforms create an exchange of value enabled by technology  and the market is comprised of participants making the exchange  The ecosystem is something larger  The overall value of a platform usually requires other players too  e g   developers who build tools to operationalize the exchange  For Twitter  the platform market is comprised of tweet creators  tweet readers  and advertisers  Its ecosystem would also include developers working on  say  the search function for the platform     Value exchange based on markets depends on incentives  and we think about it in economic terms  But there are two additional elements to the model  Platforms also have codes and cultures  these ultimately shape what becomes a community  Codes are rules of conduct that mediators enforce for operating in the market  Culture is more emergent  It grows out of values and practice as the market and ecosystem mature  It s more difficult to control  and also  as seen with Reddit and Twitter   the culture of the community can sometimes turn against the platform itself    I also go on to discuss that the role of culture depends to a large extent on the type of platform you build    We ve seen that different platforms have different degrees of dependence on the community  When the market exchange is more commoditized like Uber or Lyft providing taxis to customers strategy calls for managing economic incentives  But when a business is more individualized and varied  say apartments in Airbnb or craft sales in Etsy  strategy demands more attention to culture across the markets and ecosystem    Almost all platforms require a sense of community to some extent  no matter how bloodless the actual interaction may seem  But it is important to understand how important community is to your platform and how much of it is defined code vs  emergent culture  Uber  for example  can afford to rely heavily on defined code whereas a platform like Couchsurfing  at least when it started  relied heavily on emergent culture  At an extreme are platforms like Reddit where the tools of interaction themselves are so commoditized and the emergent culture so definitive that many have launched entirely unique communities by using the same set of tools to facilitate a new type of interaction  Hacker News  Inbound org  GrowthHackers  etc  have all used the Reddit toolset to create entirely new communities  Value is defined almost entirely by culture   Further in the interview  I also point out another issue I explore in the upcoming book Platform Revolution  the idea that platforms will eventually expand to cover the end to end experience instead of playing the traditional matchmaking role only    Brand will become more important because ultimately differentiation will move beyond creating efficient market connections  towards overall end to end experience  For example  Airbnb has to compete long term on that  and not just matching people with nice apartments  That leads back to questions of culture  Over time  even for some businesses that are initially commoditized  the community will start to matter more    The problem that I see today in a lot of discussions on platforms is that the camp that understands data and economics doesn t necessarily understand emergence and community  and sometimes even refuses to acknowledge it  while the camp that talks about community tends to talk about it in very flaky terms without understanding the role played by data and systems thinking  Platform Revolution tries to take the first tentative steps towards reconciling the two viewpoints  and I will focus a lot of my upcoming work on bridging these two camps,"[1170 346 402 1296 874 412 285 764 1367 55 648]"
1181,training-dataset/engineering/643.txt,engineering,Intercom s Hugh Durkin on the future of browsers  platforms and appsWhere users want to interact with your product will inevitably change  Hugh Durkin  Senior Product Manager at Intercom  spends his time studying how products must evolve to keep up  Following several years of developer ecosystem work at Facebook  Hugh joined Intercom to launch our Developer Platform and Program  This now includes integrations with Slack  Facebook  Fullstory  Wootric and more  Hugh s latest post   Browsers  not apps  are the future of mobile   is a must read for anyone whose work directly or indirectly relates to building software  It generated a great deal of external  and internal  debate  and in response  I invited Hugh on the podcast to further explain his thinking  Our chat covers why product builders should care whether apps or browsers win out and the implications for B2B and B2C products  as well as what shopping malls and fast food chains can teach us about platform building  If you like what you hear  check out more episodes of our podcast  You can subscribe on iTunes or grab the RSS feed  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the interview  but if you re short on time  here are five key takeaways  When it s said that browsers are replacing apps  the former casts a wider net than you might think  This is because browsers are simply destinations where we discover relevant information  whether that be Google  Facebook or Slack  The fall of apps isn t because most people are consciously deciding to delete them from their phone  Rather  it s a gradual realization that to get the information they need as quickly and easily as possible  people are changing their habits  If you re going to build a brand new product  first pinpoint the problem you re trying to solve  and then the service you can provide that solves it  The customer s route in  app  browser  etc  comes later  A lot of companies fail because they try to do everything at once  A platform can solve this  but you must get comfortable partnering with and investing in people that don t work for your own company  That also means sharing risk  If your primary goal for a platform integration is to seize a distribution opportunity  you re highly unlikely to build something useful for your customers  Instead  focus on smaller opportunities that present mutual value  John Collins  Hugh  welcome to the show  You wrote a post recently   Browsers  not apps  are the future of mobile   As a product builder  why should I care whether apps or browsers win out  Hugh Durkin  If you re a consumer  you don t really care at all  you don t even notice these things  But as a product builder  you should care a lot  It s good to understand technology cycles and where we are in them  We often forget about what s happened in the past and we should never forget a lot of those things  The whole browser versus apps thing  it s rooted in the history of the internet and the way the world used to be in the  90s  when I started using computers  We forget that in 1996  if you wanted to find out who was the President of the United States in the  70s  you would probably boot up your computer and open up Microsoft Encarta  which was installed on your computer  to find that information  If you wanted to do your accounting  you would probably  again  boot up your computer and open up Sage 50  which was installed on your computer  If you wanted to write an email  you would do it in Outlook Express in offline mode with the software that was installed on your computer  dial up  and then send it  That s very different from today where if you want to find anything about anyone  you look it up in Wikipedia  If you want to do your accounting  you use something like Xero  If you want to write email  you use Gmail  The difference between those things is they re all through the browser  over the internet  The thing that s changed in between is connectivity  In the  90s we had dial up  not even very good dial up  and we spent most of our time in offline mode  We had to use these locally installed pieces of software to do anything with our computers  Fast forward to 2007 when the iPhone came out  and the same is true  We had 2G  and connectivity was really patchy  When the iPhone launched  and a lot of people forget this  Steve Jobs basically said he didn t want native apps  He wanted web apps  HTML5  but had to relent because they had this connectivity problem  Where we re going now for mobile is through the cycle of eminent 5G   we have WiFi all over the place   so those things we needed native apps for we can increasingly just do over the internet because we re connected  It s followed the exact same technology cycle and path as desktop computing  What makes a browser John  Your definition of browser is pretty broad  You re very much thinking of the full gamut of things that effectively are browsers  but they re not Safari or Chrome  We don t share apps  we share URLs  Hugh  Again  we constantly forget everything  including where we spend our time  Back in the  90s  the definition of a browser was this thing you opened up if you were dialed up to the internet  You d go into it  use a search bar to type in a URL or a web address  or search in Altavista or Lycos  and it was all about this experience of pulling content to you  You had to go and discover it yourself  All of this is just about finding information in different ways  On a mobile  we spend so many hours in messengers or on Facebook  and we re discovering information that s relevant to us based on friend recommendations  It s still browsing  We don t share apps  we share URLs  It s still browsing the internet  but it s just a different way of doing it  It s more like push versus pull  If you look at Facebook  especially on iOS  when you open one of those URLs  it has the web address at the top  it s got back buttons  all that a traditional browser would have  Those really are just a new type of browser  In traditional browsers on desktop  we ll probably see them merge even more  where they have messaging functionality built into them as well  John  So for instance  at work Slack is the browser a lot of us are using  Hugh  Yeah  same kind of thing  Back in the day  if you wanted to find a document  you d have to walk over to somebody s desk and get them to email it  You had to request it  Now  Slack pushes you the stuff that your colleagues or Slackbot think is useful   For many of us  Slack is becoming the default browser we use at work  The future  or lack thereof  for apps John  Aren t there some jobs that mobile apps are really good at  or do you think that was really just a solution for a point in time where connectivity was not as universal as it is now  Hugh  There are definitely use cases for native  locally installed apps  One is communication tools  which social networks and messengers are  A native app is useful for things you might spend hours a day doing  at least today anyway  For most other use cases  I don t see the point  Say you re searching for a flight  I don t know why you would need to go through the friction of downloading an app just to do that  Just do a search on the internet  and it s just instant  John  A lot of brands are actually killing their native apps  Hugh  Patagonia is one example  and there are a few more  Last year Burberry released a lot of information about how their mobile e commerce offering is increasing their overall sales  What they failed to mention is they don t actually have a native app  There are lots of retail brands who ve already gone down that path  I think we ll see travel go down that path too  It s becoming more of a thing all the time   Fashion brand Burberry has reported strong mobile e commerce sales but it doesn t have a mobile app  John  There s a feeling that some people are turning against apps because they feel they re being tracked and targeted with ads all the time  At least with a browser  you can employ an ad blocker  This is all about information retrieval at the end of the day  Hugh  The majority of people aren t consciously deciding to delete all the apps off their phone  It s just this gradual realization that to get the information they need   and this is all about information retrieval at the end of the day  and content curation and consumption   people are changing their habits and doing it a different way  I don t think people are consciously thinking   I don t trust this thing   There definitely is an issue  If you think about when you visit a URL  you just visit the URL and you don t worry about it too much  Whereas if you re going to download an app  you might wonder what will happen to the data after you ve downloaded this thing onto your phone  I m not too sure the majority of people consciously think that way  but it could be a factor as well  John  It s been awhile since someone has said to me   hey  have you seen this great new app   We all spend our time in a small number of apps   the big messengers  big social networks  Is that a failure of the App Store model  Is discovering new apps or new apps breaking through more difficult than  say  three years ago  Hugh  It s not very useful searching across a bunch of stuff that s defined at the OS level  If you search the App Store  you re searching through Apple s lens of the world  Whereas if you search the internet  it s this standard based thing that s pretty well defined  There s definitely an element of discovery there  but think back again   apps were this way to get more utility from a phone that was offline unless people were using the internet  Search functionality in the App Store probably had more usefulness then  because people were literally searching for stuff to do to get more value out of their phone  Today people don t really search for apps anymore  Even just thinking of apps as a thing on their own is kind of pointless  An app is literally just one interface into a service  What people want is a service  or information  or content  or whatever it is  and they don t really think too much about how they get it  Naturally  they re just doing it over the web  and I think that s probably what s driving lower installs in the App Store  John  So if Uber pops up in Facebook Messenger when you mention an address  people would be just as happy with that as they would be opening the Uber app  Hugh  Yeah  even better  you don t have to download anything  There s no friction  An app is literally just one interface into a service  John  Does this thinking apply to B2B as much as it does in the consumer world  Hugh  It s the same  I m probably oversimplifying it  but if it s all about information creation and consumption  the same thing happens in work as it does in your personal life  In your personal life  you might want to book a flight to go on holidays  but B2B  you might want to book a flight to do a work trip  At home  you might want to craft an email to send to your friends  or you re doing a Facebook message  same applies in work too  We actually share a lot of the same jobs across our personal lives and our work lives  Look at Dropbox  Dropbox scaled as a tool because they give it away for free first so people use it in their personal lives and then it kind of creeped into the enterprise  I don t think there s much of a big difference across both of those worlds  The jobs are still the same  Developer implications John  What s the opportunity here for developers  What questions should they ask about their own product in relation to this space  How should they think about it  Hugh  I still hear developers today say they re out to create something new and create a business  and they always start by saying   I m thinking about building an app   Then it s   I m thinking about building an iOS app   They ve heard that people who install apps through the Apple App Store spend more money  It s completely the wrong lens  If you re going to build a brand new product  the first lens you should think through is  first of all  what s the problem you re trying to solve  and then what s the service you can provide that solves that problem  Then after that  you kind of think about the routes in for your potential customers  I d almost guarantee that if you think in that way first you ll end up not building an app at all because you ll realize you don t need it  Think about the lightweight  small things that will add little bits of value for people and start there  Don t go super deep on something  because you d probably just end up building this really complex app where you could actually just have plugged in the service that you re going to build into multiple places at once  John  Does that involve giving up control that developers are not as used to  People said the App Store involved giving up control  but we re seeing that erosion for the independent guy  Hugh  A lot of this is defined by where people are spending their time  If you think about where people are spending their time  whether it s WhatsApp  or Facebook  or Slack  the experience that they ve designed is very thoughtful  As an example  say you want to open up a bit of functionality in your service through a card that s embedded in a messenger  like Facebook  It s okay to give up creative control of how that renders because Facebook have thought about it  Whereas some developers and designers in the past might ve been so caught up in the design detail of how an interaction should work if they re going to build the app from scratch  But it s okay to give up the creative control to the platform because they ve made all those design decisions already  Shopping centers  the original platform  John  You gave a really interesting talk on our Inside Intercom World Tour about what software companies can learn from shopping centers  Why are historical comparisons like that so important to you  Hugh  History s usually handy for a couple of reasons  It s a group of stories and if you want to try and help people understand complex subjects  usually  you relate it with stories  If you look at entrepreneurs  they tend to study history  logic  politics  etc  because they want to learn from the way that people behave and the changing environment and economics  and you can apply that anywhere  History s also useful as well because it repeats itself  If people have screwed up in the past  you can always refer to those stories and learn something  John  When it comes to platforms  what are the lessons we should take away from those formative years of retail  Hugh  A lot of people get really confused about software platforms and don t understand the dynamics  The story I use in that shopping center talk is about the company that became Target Corporation  They moved from being a small department store to actually being a landlord and opening up shopping malls  It changed the dynamics of the business and it changed how they scaled  They shared the risk with a bunch of other people  When they were moving into new markets  they partnered with local retailers   that s the partnership part of their platform strategy  By letting other people in and sharing the success and sharing the risk  everyone grew  That s typical of normal platform dynamics  Compare that story and how they changed to Facebook  before they launched Facebook platform  John  You were at Facebook when all of that was happening  For a company like that  when you re opening up  how do you make that change in mindset  How you make that transition into becoming a platform company  Hugh  The first thing is this realization that you can t do everything  A lot of companies fail because they try and do everything at once  The first part of it s just a mindset change  like literally opening up your doors  being comfortable with people partnering with you  sharing things with them  sharing the risk  investing in people that don t work for your own company  It starts there  A lot of companies fail because they try and do everything at once  It s the same thing with a shopping center  If your department store is one of the anchor tenants  you might be worried about the shops that surround you  that they might do a bad job  That fear will only slow you down from just following through and then seeing if it happens or not  The way to solve a lot of that stuff is by laying ground rules and having policies  Again  the same things apply across both  It s a mindset change thing to be okay with feeling a bit vulnerable   not worrying too much about what people might do and being more worried about how you can move quickly if they do bad things  John  Staying with history for a minute  we launched our developer program with a blog post that referenced McDonald s and their Filet O Fish  If I m not disrupting In N Out Burger  what can I learn from McDonald s about software  Hugh  The thing that a lot of people don t really know about McDonald s is that three of their products   the Big Mac  Filet O Fish  and Egg McMuffin  weren t invented by McDonald s Corporation  The franchisees invented them  The franchisees had localized problems that they needed to invent their way out of  The Filet O Fish  as an example  the franchisee who invented that was on the East Coast of the United States in a very deeply Roman Catholic area  If you re Roman Catholic  you can t eat meat on a Friday  so this guy had basically zero sales on Fridays  He was screwed  so he invented the Filet O Fish to solve that problem  The Egg McMuffin was a similar thing  Owning a restaurant is like the airline industry  If you ve got a low cost airline  you ve got loads of planes  and you want to keep them in the sky as long as possible  because you ve got all these fixed costs you want to cover  If you re a franchisee  you ve got your rent  you ve got all these fixed costs  so opening in the morning will help offset those and help you make money  McDonald s had no breakfast products  so this dude invented the Egg McMuffin  The funny thing about those stories is  at the time  McDonald s had a rule book that said   You can t bring your own products in  you can t change anything  we re McDonald s  we know everything   It took them a couple of years to realize in each case they could roll the solution out all over the US and make more money  It s a good example of being open to listening to the ecosystem  like your platform ecosystem  to get their ideas and help them refine their ideas for the benefit of everyone  Platform dynamics is one of those relatable stories where the benefits of having more people outside of your company focused on you and your success  rather than just yourself  is actually better for everyone  Building on the Intercom platform,"[1181 282 217 840

1190,training-dataset/business/271.txt,business,Strategies for Marketing in Asia   The MacroEli Schwartz is the Director of Marketing  APAC  for SurveyMonkey   After a year and a half leading SurveyMonkey s marketing efforts in Asia  I have gleaned insights about the Asian market that would ve taken me much longer to learn from a distance in the US  SurveyMonkey is the world s leading survey platform and before I arrived we already had a sizable user base across Asia  Nonetheless  the on the ground learning that individualized our marketing approach to this region has been able to accelerate growth by double digit percentages   Typically  International SEO  SEM and social media can always be conducted without the need to be embedded in a local market  however  the ramp up time for a successful campaign is significantly shortened with hands on exposure  If marketing in Asia is anywhere in your eventual roadmap  hopefully I can smooth your learning curve with what were  to me  eye opening discoveries   Dialects Matter  There are actually several Chinese languages that a Western audience simply defines as  Chinese   Even within these multiple Chinese languages  there are distinct dialects that can even confuse speakers of the same language  Mandarin is the official Chinese language of China as well as Taiwan  Singapore  which also has three other official languages of Malay  English and Tamil   and Malaysia  in addition to Malay  Tamil and English   The manufacturing hub Guangzhou  the province of Guandong  as well the special regions of Hong Kong and Macau all speak Cantonese   When marketing to a  Chinese  audience  it is critical to be mindful of your target market and contract native speakers to write for that market  A Beijinger should write for a Beijing audience  and a Taiwanese person should write for Taiwan   There is No Catch All Alphabet  Even within the Chinese language  there are two distinct different alphabets  China and Singapore  for the occasions that Chinese is used  officially use a simplified set of characters that have less strokes and are considered easier to write  Hong Kong  Macau  and Taiwan use traditional characters  While traditional Chinese readers can easily understand simplified characters  simplified readers might have a hard time understanding traditional characters  As a result  there is no catch all alphabet that can be used when creating content for Chinese speakers   Payments Methods Differ Vastly From The US  Unlike in the US or the Eurozone  there are myriad issues in Asia related to foreign currency and transacting cross border business  In addition  there are vast amounts of wealthy potential customers that just do not have credit or debit cards which makes any kind of online transaction infinitely more challenging  To accommodate this reality  many companies create options to accept cash on delivery or utilize local convenience stores as locations where customers can pay in cash  Even for those that have credit cards  their cards may not even be approved for overseas use  so essentially  credit card adoption rates don t even tell the full story of a potential customer base   Don t spend time only thinking about how to reach new customers across Asia  also consider how these customers will eventually pay for a product  Payment gateway solutions like Alipay or Paypal should be considered as these companies shoulder the burden of receiving the customer s funds  but they are not a perfect fit for everyone   Internet Access Methods Change as Income Increases  Economic standing has the greatest impact on the size of any product s addressable market  While many in the media might tout smartphone ownership in Asia as evidence of the growth of the middle class  there are still many people that don t earn enough in a month to buy even the cheapest smartphone  Furthermore  smartphone ownership in Asia is not a guarantee that there is actually a data plan attached to the phone due to affordability or cell reception  Some people never purchase data plans and just rely on WiFi while others only have limited data packages  Understanding the income levels of a target market must be an important part of building a potential buyer persona  Lower income people cannot necessarily be reached online  but may be able to utilize an online service if they discover it through other means   Build Apps For Android and Make Them Small  As most people are aware  Asia is mobile first and Android is the dominant operating system  When building campaigns and assets for Asia  always consider a mobile first experience and  when you need to choose  build apps for Android  Given the limited data plans and sometimes even small memory space on lower end phones  developers should ensure that apps use as minimal data as possible  see above point  and don t take up a lot of memory on the phone   In the US and other more developed Internet economies  Google will demote less mobile friendly websites  however  this does not seem to be the case in much of Asia  yet  Even so  it is worthwhile to optimize products and websites for a mobile user simply to have an enhanced experience for the majority of your potential user base   Conclusion  Asia is a fascinating mishmash of cultures  history  and rapid growth  While it is far more challenging to figure out how to grow an audience base in Asia than it might be in Europe or the USA  it is well worth the effort  Beneath the unpredictability and business complexities  lies a tremendous amount of opportunity and potential  With the tips above as a head start  just leap in   About Eli  Eli Schwartz is the Director of Marketing  APAC  for SurveyMonkey  the world s largest online survey platform  He oversees

1196,training-dataset/product/175.txt,product,These 5 major UI mistakes will kill your appThere s no one universal formula for a great UI app design  if you know one  please let us know   But we do know some major mistakes to avoid if you want to deliver a great app   We ve seen every one of these mistakes made by designers of all levels of experience  There s no shame in that a good UI design is a multifaceted challenge  and many aspects can be simply overlooked   At All In Mobile  we often redesign apps for clients who are not satisfied with their product and want to improve the way their app looks and feels  That s why today we want to share some major no nos we ve gathered   Of course  we re about fixing solutions  not just pointing them out  That s why we ll also show you a redesigned app view list  demonstrating all 5 of these major UI mistakes and how your team can fix them   UI mistake 1  Abusing fonts  Let s start with system font families   For example  San Francisco is a system font for iOS  and Android has Roboto  They re both easy to read and fairly similar   Related  4 tips on typography in UI design  Are system fonts okay to use  Yes  definitely  It s a safe and proven option  But remember Samsung phones allow you to change the default font  Your beautifully designed app can be killed in an instant if the phone user switches into Choco Cooky font   You can also opt for a more sophisticated solution and choose a custom font  If you go this route  though  keep in mind   Less is more  There might be plenty of awesome fonts  but be reasonable  Fonts should add to the user experience  Too many types  sizes  colors  etc  can complicate things  If you go for custom fonts  keep it simple and coherent  Add custom fonts only when needed and where it actually improves the app and using custom fonts for the sake of having custom fonts is not a good enough reason   License  A few months ago we were asked to redesign a fashion app  While reviewing the fonts we came across 2 commercial fonts  both being used without any bigger purpose and without license  This mistake could have cost the client  2 000  A font is software and always licensed  If you embed a font into a mobile app  make sure you read the license and the terms of use  Don t know the license  Then don t use the font   UI mistake 2  Too much on the screen  When phones were much smaller  designers faced issues bundling necessary things onto the screen  For example  the iPhone 4 had 640 960 resolution and 2 3 ratio  With the advent of supersized phones  or phablets   we can put more stuff on the screen bigger fonts  more buttons  and fancier design   Be wary of falling into this freedom trap  More isn t more  so be selective  Every additional item has to be processed by the user  Attract their attention wisely so they can easily navigate the app  If there s too much on the screen  users can easily get lost and wonder what to do or where to click  Use design to focus the user s eye on significant aspects  You want people to access the important content straight away and in an intuitive way   UI mistake 3  Lack of consistency  Be consistent when you design  Don t send mixed signals to users  If you use one element for a specific action  stick with it  Users learn by doing certain actions  and if they encounter unexpected or ambiguous actions  it can really ruin their experience   Also keep a consistent layout for the most part  For instance  use the same colors and elements to create a repeating pattern  Use style guides to set standards so that you can stay on the right track when designing   Consistent layouts help users learn their way through your app  but you can have some exceptions  like the login page or other screens with dedicated uses  Whenever you break out of the pattern  keep in mind that every element still needs to make up a whole   UI mistake 4  Transferring from iOS to Android 1 1  It made sense to do 1 1 transfers from iOS to Android until Android 4 0  when Holo Design appeared  It was the first sensible theme for Android  with structures  guidelines  and navigation that was incompatible with iOS   Why not transfer directly from iOS to Android  or vice versa  Doesn t it save you time and money   Well  it might  but the ultimate goal is to create the best user experience  right  And users have habits and preferences  They use their phones all the time  and they grow accustomed to how their particular one functions  So if your applications behave differently than what people are used to  they re way less likely to enjoy using it   Android and iOS have their own interaction patterns  and users might not be pleased if you serve them something else they ll have to learn from scratch  If you transfer from iOS to Android  or the other way around   you could also make consistency mistakes from device to device   There s good news  though your app doesn t have to look completely different for iOS and Android  Try to keep most of your visual style for both platforms  Take for example the case of car rental app Silvercar  They came up with their own navigation style  but at the same time they retained consistency between the mobile operating systems   UI mistake 5  Poor information hierarchy  When you design something  whatever it is a business card  a website  an app a person will interact with it in some way  You need to plan and design according to the degree of significance of the information you re presenting  based on the way someone will interact with it   Sit down and think about the most important thing you want to show  Once you know your priorities  you can distinguish significant things with the help of fonts  colors  size  location  etc  You need to think about what people do with your product in ideal and non ideal settings and design it accordingly   Mistakes and solutions in practice  Now we re going to show you what all of these mistakes look like in practice  and how to fix them  As an example  we ll redesign a view list for a food ordering app   A client with a food ordering app decided to add the option of rating restaurants  but the previous design didn t provide for such a solution  We took this opportunity to improve a few things   The previous screen was designed at a time when iPhone 5 still held a greater share of the market  It had smaller cells  a smaller restaurant logo  and more compressed text  When viewed on new devices  too many elements appeared on the screen  making it more difficult to read   That s where we stepped in and made some changes   As you can see  the cells are more distant from each other  don t fuse together anymore  and everything looks clear  The user isn t overwhelmed by the number of items on the screen  Also  the hierarchy of information has been improved  Now  the most important element is the logo  A returning user is more likely to quickly recognize the logo than to read the brand name  Previously  the name was fighting with the logo   Another element that needed work was the typography  We used the Oswald font for names and tags  We initially anticipated only one line for tags  but some restaurants have a really rich offer  and so we enabled ourselves to fit as many tags as possible   We also include visualization of the Android version with the system font and Choco Cooky on Samsung phones  We solved this issue by adding Roboto as the custom font   To add the rating portion the client wanted  we decided to use the stars  Hotels and Michelin Guides use it  so it made sense to us   But there was a problem  We d used stars in the previous design to mark favorite restaurants  We couldn t place these 2 elements together because it d be confusing  Liking a restaurant has nothing to do with its rating  and we would be left using the same symbol for those 2 actions  We didn t want to be inconsistent  nor did we want to change the meaning of a symbol from one version to another  In the end  we solved the issue with a screen informing users a new feature had been added   Even if you avoid these 5 major mistakes  what you designed might fall apart when the user comes into contact with it   You simply can t anticipate everything people might do  That s why you have to observe the behavior and needs of the users with the help of analytics and other tools  Then  react accordingly and improve your app  Design should be about changing to improve UX continuously   Never rest on your laurels  because there s always something you can design better,"[1196 477 840 252 1318 501 623 810 882 1059 647]"

1210,training-dataset/engineering/648.txt,engineering,Improving Video Playback on Android   Instagram EngineeringImproving Video Playback on Android  As Instagram has grown  and mobile network bandwidth has improved  video has become a larger part of the app experience  The time people spent watching video in the last half increased by more than 40   and yesterday  we announced longer video to give creators more flexibility and open up new ways to connect with the community  In this post  we ll share some of the things we ve done to improve video playback on Android and maintain user experience while increasing video length 4x   Instagram introduced 15 second video in 2013  One of our core engineering values is  Do the Simple Thing First   so we implemented a basic video playback mechanism on Android  When a video appears in feed  the app first downloads the whole video file to the phone storage  After the download is complete  the file is passed to the Android built in MediaPlayer to play the video   This design worked well when the maximum video length was only 15 seconds  However  we recently decided to increase the maximum video length to 60 seconds  We recognized this would stress our current design for a few reasons   Video cannot play until the whole file is downloaded  As the video becomes larger  playback would wait even longer for the video to download  People on slower network connections might need to wait for a very long time before they can play the first second of the video  Video won t play if there s a disk space issue  If there is not enough space in the disk to store the whole video file in the disk cache or if there s some failure in the I O  the video will never play   With those issues in mind  we decided to build a new video cache that could stream the video to the MediaPlayer as the video file is being downloaded  This would remove the bottleneck of waiting for the download to finish   We started to look into how to build a streaming video cache that worked with our current video player  We found that the Android MediaPlayer only supports playing a video from either a file or a URL  We wouldn t have the complete video file to give to the MediaPlayer when we are still downloading  so this leaves us with playing the video from a URL  The naive approach of passing our CDN URL to the MediaPlayer would mean that we wouldn t have any control over the bytes downloaded  so we would not be able to cache the video in case a person wanted to watch it again  Knowing this fact  we decided to have the MediaPlayer interact with a local proxy server instead  and have the proxy server serve the byte stream to the media player while also storing it into the disk cache   It turns out that this new design solves many of the problems in the previous design with some extra benefits   Playback is no longer blocked by the video download  i e  it plays as soon as there s enough content  Playback is no longer dependent on disk space  Even if the disk cache malfunctions  it would just be treated as a cache miss and streamed directly from the server  Allows more prefetching adjustments  This new mechanism allows us to explore more options in regard to prefetching video files depending on the network condition  as the prefetched content can now be directly streamed while we download the rest of the file on background   We tested our new implementation extensively across many devices and Android versions  Our testing surfaced an issue  Some Android Lollipop devices made multiple  up to 3  download requests before playing the video   they would request the beginning of the file  then make a HTTP range request for the end of the file  then request the beginning again  To figure this out  we need to understand a little about the mp4 file format  An mp4 is a container for one or more video and audio tracks  and it contains metadata that specifies where each of these tracks start  We had already reconfigured our video encoding to place this metadata at the start of the file  instead of the end  the default   to avoid the inefficient behavior of making multiple requests to play the video  We hypothesized that the MediaPlayer was not playing nice with our video encoding   Upon deeper investigation  we managed to scope the problem down to devices that use NuPlayer  which is the default implementation of MediaPlayer starting in Lollipop  replacing the older AwesomePlayer   Looking deeper into the MPEG4Extractor and NuCachedSource2 code  we deduced that NuPlayer was not handling one of the MP4 container atoms  specifically  the FREE atom  correctly and was getting confused  Removing FREE atoms solved the problem  and we modified our video transcoding tier to include this cleanup logic before we launched the new video playback  We were pretty satisfied with the result of the new implementation   Below are some of the  statistically significant  results we gathered after performing a limited A B test of streaming vs  non streaming playback with 15 second videos in the wild   The table above shows three metrics  percentage of videos played within 1 second of scrolling on screen  the average start delay to the first frame of the video  and the 95th percentile of the start delay distribution  We initially started by gathering data on the number of videos played within 1 second and the average start delay for all videos  We noticed that the new streaming cache performed worse for the number of videos that played within 1 second  0 8  fewer videos   but better for average time to play  18  lower  Since these results contradicted each other  we dug in to analyze the data further   We sliced the data to exclude videos that started playing within 200ms  The majority of the videos that play within 200ms are probably cached fully on disk  which shouldn t be affected by our new implementation  We hypothesized that removing the data  noise  from these cached videos would help us get a more accurate measurement of the impact of the streaming player  and help us to understand the discrepancy in performance between less than 1 second video play time vs  the average  Removing the lower end of the distribution gave us a more accurate view of the impact of the streaming player  the average and p95 time to play are faster by 22 28   However  this still didn t explain why the number of videos that played within 1 second was actually lower with streaming enabled  We dug in deeper still and plotted the time to play distribution of the videos   This plot shows the percentage of videos  y axis  that are played within a certain number of seconds  x axis   Looking at the distribution  we see that the streaming cache  black bars  improved the start time in general  but it seemed to regress the start time for videos that had formerly fallen into the 0 1 second bucket  To try to explain this result  we circled back to check the implementation of MediaPlayer  We discovered that using the setUrl API incurs an artificial 1 second start delay on some older versions of Android MediaPlayer  to give the streaming buffer extra time to fill   This matches the data plot above and explains the result we gathered  In general  the streaming cache has shifted the distribution to the left  you can see the long tail of only blue bars   but pushes some of the leftmost distribution slightly to the right  The impact of this artificial delay is minimal  because we wrote code to shortcut the proxy server and play the file directly if it is fully cached  the setFile API does not have a delay    We did the simple thing first when we first launched video on Instagram  and shipped a stable and robust video viewing experience to our users in a timely manner  But doing the simple thing first does not mean that we sacrifice quality or performance  On the contrary  we focus on what matters most at the time and continuously reevaluate what we have to make sure that the whole app experience is top notch  Video playback is one recent example where changing product requirements led us to rethink our initial assumptions  It also showcases the importance of collecting and analyzing data to verify that performance improvements are actually working as expected  We hope that by providing a better video playback experience we will enable more people to enjoy the moments that they have captured and shared on Instagram,"[467 1210 1358 351 885 162 571 947 926 1256 1059]"

clients get an investment  Two of the most common reasons for companies not getting an investment for their app ideas   They don t have their financial estimates ready They don t understand the specifics of pitching an app idea as opposed to anything else  So let s talk about what you need to include in your pitch when you re trying to get an investment for your app idea   Have a prototype ready  If you want someone to invest in your app  you must have a fully designed prototype  The app market is still relatively new only 8 years old  in fact  And for many investors it might be difficult to fully comprehend how the app will function if they can t see it   Having a prototype shows that you re serious  Anyone can come up with a great idea  but it s the execution that matters  If you aren t willing to put time and perhaps some money into creating a designed prototype  why should an investor be willing to put up their money   Creating a prototype is actually pretty easy   Choose 1 3 main user stories  or the sequence of screens user will see before achieving their goal  and design them If you have some funds  you can hire a professional designer or an app design and development company to help you with the design  No funds  Use UI kits they let you quickly design a user story by simply dragging and dropping design elements  Then prototype it in InVision and you re good to go   A day of work prototyping can be the difference between you getting  1 million and you struggling to pay the rent   Related  UX design tips for your app  Finally  consider how you ll make your pitch  Shark Tank is a great show  but don t expect pitching to be like that you don t always get to stand in front of investors and show your carefully prepared slides   Most pitches actually happen over coffee or lunch  not like  Shark Tank   If you re thinking you ll be able to fit your laptop and your printed slides on the table between cups and utensils  think again  Make it easier  and less awkward  by simply pulling up a prototype on your phone and walking them through your app   Have a development plan  Let s assume the investors like your idea  The next thing they want to know is what it takes to execute it   There are 3 ways you can develop an app  or any software  for that matter    Develop it yourself Hire full time developers Hire an app development company  The choice will depend largely on your skills  your budget  and the scope of work   If you re a great developer and you can finish the app on your own in less than 2 months  then you might want to do just that  However  that rarely happens because most apps will require back end coding in addition to front end app coding and very few developers are great at both   If you have a good budget and know where to hire great developers  consider assembling a full time development team  The potential downsides here include high salaries  unless you have an equity deal in place   and possibly hiring the wrong people who won t perform the way you ll expect them to   Or  you can hire an app development company  This allows you to keep your equity  avoid any long term commitment  and have access to all types of developers and designers  The main drawback company rates vary significantly  The same app can cost you between  50 000 and  500 000 to develop depending on the shop   Whichever option you choose  create a timeline broken down into feature related milestones and associated costs  Research average salaries and talk with few app development shops to fully understand your options   Having an app means having a business  Market it   The app market is very different from most other businesses once you re ready to launch  you already have a distributor ready to show your app to people  If you re selling cereal  you need pay for shelf space to get into stores  If you re a dry cleaner  you need to pay for real estate where you ll place your business   With apps  it s different  Once you ve launched  you automatically have your real estate and your shelf space at the App Store   This really messes up the way people think about apps  Many assume that just because your app is now live and visible to anyone on the app store  you can just sit and collect money   Nope   Having an app means having a business  And if no one knows about it  no one will use it  To acquire users  you need a marketing plan   Many user acquisition strategies exist  Here are a few of the most important   Do App Store optimization to make sure you rank high for important keywords  Have a website with an email signup to notify users when you re going to launch  Have a budget for  cost per install  ads that will allow you to pay only for users installing your app on their phones  Consider having public beta tests that will help you get early loyal users  Use general PR methods and reach out media to get them to write about you  By studying your competition and how they market their product  you ll be able to estimate your expenses and potential users  Also  have those numbers ready when an investor asks   Major pitching rules still apply  Though there are some differences  apps still follow the main pitching rules  Prepare a pitch deck clearly conveying the problem you re solving  how you re going to solve it  and what financial benefits are waiting should you be successful   Be a salesperson and a storyteller  Know your numbers  but don t make it a boring accounting lecture  Explain why you are passionate about the idea and show your passion  Often  it s not the idea that people invest in it s you  If the light in your eyes conveys passion  and you show you re serious about your numbers and execution  you ll double your chances of getting an investment   At the end of the day getting an investment can be tough  and it might take you quite some time before you get it   But don t give up  Keep going out there and reaching out to new investors  As long as you re prepared and have confidence in your idea  it s just a question of time until you get an investor to write you a check,"[1233 882 840 38 647 1318 411 810 623 1181 435]"
1242,training-dataset/business/1074.txt,business,Product lessons from Snap s S 1   Sam Gerstenzang   MediumProduct lessons from Snap s S 1  Snap  Inc  is the best consumer software product organization operating today  as measured by the quality and uniqueness of what they ship  which is what counts   What follows is a close reading of selected passages from their S 1 filing  that show just how unusual they are   Our strategy is to invest in product innovation and take risks to improve our camera platform   I can t state strongly enough how differentiated this is  No other company who has reached this scale works this way  Their long term differentiation is not based on a classic  moat  but instead on the velocity of product innovation  Snap operates like a toddler running head first down the gangway  Without momentum  Snap believes it will fall flat to the ground   In other words  Snap doesn t believe network effects will save them  In our current App Store mobile world  where you can launch a new social app by authenticating it against the address book  network effects are reliant on the value of aggregated historic content  of which Snapchat has very little   This is also why Facebook significantly overpaid for Whatsapp  Any additional friction or slow execution will be quickly rewarded by users leaking to cheaper or more innovative messaging apps   In a world where anyone can distribute products instantly and provide them for free  the best way to compete is by innovating to create the most engaging products  That s because it s difficult to use distribution or cost as a competitive advantage   new software is available to users immediately  and for free  We believe this means that our industry favors companies that innovate  because people will use their products   This is true  but I believe the conclusion is wrong  This effect actually favors the incumbent  Internet connected software can be retroactively bundled  meaning new features can be brought to existing userbases  Instead of requiring a new app  Snapchat can add filters that are just a swipe away   This is good for Snapchat compared to upstarts  but bad when Instagram and Facebook can do the same starting with larger numbers of users  After years of slow execution  Instagram has finally turned on their Xerox machine and aimed it at Venice Beach  copying features like the Story and the disappearing message   Instagram s best trait has always been flawless execution of other people s ideas  But Snap is good at pure invention  and they believe this is their core competitive advantage   Early on  we thought about charging our community to use additional features  For example  we saw so many people having fun with the Creative Tools we made  like drawing and captions  and we thought people might want to purchase additional ways to express themselves  To test this hypothesis  we built a Lens Store where our users could buy new Lenses  in addition to the free ones we already provided  The results were disappointing  Only a small number of people wanted to buy Lenses  and the number of people using Lenses decreased  After a few weeks  we got rid of the Lens store and made all of the Lenses available for free  Almost immediately  our community began to use Lenses more and create more Snaps to send to their friends and add to their Story   This short description of Snap s process is actually extraordinarily revealing  Snap is so good at product innovation precisely because they are okay with being wrong  They try large risky things  take feedback  and try again  They re perfectly ok with launching and then rolling back major product changes  like Auto Advance  because it taught Snap  and their users  a new way of interacting with the product  which they eventually figure out to execute well  in the form of Story Playlist    Additionally  our products often use technologies that demand a lot of processing power and don t work as well on lower end devices  like the technology behind Lenses  This means that unlike many other free mobile applications  the majority of our users tend to be located in markets with high end mobile devices and high speed cellular internet   We have found that these markets are also less expensive to serve because our cloud infrastructure partners typically have better performance and cheaper bandwidth in these countries  As such  our costs tend to be lower in these markets   This is also a rather remarkable choice  Because the features Snap wants to deliver aren t widely accessible in developing markets  Snap admits they won t be competitive there  Another company would create a low end version of their product to take global market share  But Snap would prefer to wait for these markets to come to them   This also highlights Snap s massive computing costs  Just a few days ago  Snap signed a contract with Google Compute Cloud  requiring them to pay at least  400 million a year for the next five years  There is some debate about whether building out their own infrastructure would have been more cost effective  I don t know   But it is worth noting that the ability to outsource infrastructure is precisely what enabled Snap to build so quickly and scale with a fairly junior team for so long  Snapchat was built on top of Google s App Engine  a so called  platform as a service  that abstracted many of the technology decisions a company had to make if it launched just a few years before   This point underlies Snap s fear of competition  because they are completely aware that the advantage now lays with those who innovate with a deep understanding of users rather than who rely on scale and expertise as an advantage  The next  25 billion company might have a single engineer

1256,training-dataset/business/1047.txt,business,The Great Unbundling   Stratechery by Ben ThompsonTo say that the Internet has changed the media business is so obvious it barely bears writing  the media business  though  is massive in scope  ranging from this site to The Walt Disney Company  with a multitude of formats  categories  and business models in between  And  it turns out that the impact of the Internet   and the outlook for the future   differs considerably depending on what part of the media industry you look at   The Old Media Model  Nearly all media in the pre Internet era functioned under the same general model   Note that there are two parts in this model when it comes to making money   distribution and then integration   and the order matters  Distribution required massive up front investment  whether that be printing presses  radio airplay and physical media  or broadcast licenses and cable wires  the payoff was that those that owned distribution could create money making integrations   Print  Newspapers and magazines primarily made money by integrating editorial and advertisements into a single publication   Music  Record labels primarily made money by integrating back catalogs with new acts  which over time became part of the back catalog in their own right    TV  Broadcast TV functioned similarly to print  control of distribution  via broadcast licenses  made it possible to integrate programming and advertising   Cable TV combined the broadcast TV model with bundling  a particular form of integration   The Economics of Bundling  It is important to understand the economics of bundling  Chris Dixon has written the definitive piece on the topic   Under assumptions that apply to most information based businesses  bundling benefits buyers and sellers  Consider the following simple model for the willingness to pay of two cable buyers  the  sports lover  and the  history lover   What price should the cable companies charge to maximize revenues  Note that optimal prices are always somewhere below the buyers  willingness to pay  Otherwise the buyer wouldn t benefit from the purchase  For simplicity  assume prices are set 10  lower than willingness to pay  If ESPN and the History Channel were sold individually  the revenue maximizing price would be  9   10 with a 10  discount   Sports lovers would buy ESPN and history lovers would buy the History Channel  The cable company would get  18 in revenue  By bundling channels  the cable company can charge each customer  11 70   13 discounted 10   for the bundle  yielding combined revenue of  23 40  The consumer surplus would be  2 in the non bundle and  2 60 in the bundle  Thus both buyers and sellers benefit from bundling   Dixon s article is worth reading in full  what is critical to understand  though  is that while control of distribution created the conditions for the creation of the cable bundle  there is an underlying economic logic that is independent of distribution  if customers like more than one thing  then both content creators and customers gain from a bundle   When Distribution Goes to Zero  A consistent theme on Stratechery is that perhaps the most important consequence of the Internet  at least from a business perspective  was the reduction of the cost of distribution to effectively zero   The most obvious casualty has been text based publications  and the reason should be clear  once newspapers and magazines lost their distribution based monopoly on customer attention the integration of editorial and advertising fell apart  Advertisers could go directly to end users  first via ad networks and increasingly via Google and Facebook exclusively  while end users could avail themselves of any publication on the planet   For Google and Facebook  the new integration is users and advertisers  and the new lock in is attention  it is editorial that has nowhere else to go   The music industry  meanwhile  has  at least relative to newspapers  come out of the shift to the Internet in relatively good shape  while piracy drove the music labels into the arms of Apple  which unbundled the album into the song  streaming has rewarded the integration of back catalogs and new music with bundle economics  more and more users are willing to pay  10 month for access to everything  significantly increasing the average revenue per customer  The result is an industry that looks remarkably similar to the pre Internet era   Notice how little power Spotify and Apple Music have  neither has a sufficient user base to attract suppliers  artists  based on pure economics  in part because they don t have access to back catalogs  Unlike newspapers  music labels built an integration that transcends distribution   That leaves the ever fascinating TV industry  which has resisted the effects of the Internet for a few different reasons   First  and most obviously  until the past few years the Internet did not mean zero cost distribution  streaming video takes considerable bandwidth that most people lacked  And  on the flipside  producing compelling content is difficult and expensive  in stark contrast to text in particular but also music  This meant less competition   Second  advertisers   and brand advertisers  in particular   choose TV not because it is the only option  like newspapers were   but because it delivers a superior return on investment  A television commercial is not only more compelling than a print advertisement  but it can reach a massive number of potential customers for a relatively low price and relatively low investment of resources  more on this in a moment    Third  as noted above  the cable bundle  like streaming  has its own economic rationale for not just programmers and cable providers but also customers   This first factor  particularly the lack of sufficient bandwidth  has certainly decreased in importance the last few years  what is interesting about TV  though  is that it is no more a unitary industry than is media  figuring out what will happen next requires unpacking TV into its different components   The Jobs That TV Does  In 2013 I wrote a piece called The Jobs TV Does where I posited that TV has traditionally filled multiple roles in people s lives   TV kept us informed  TV provided educational content  TV provided a live view of sporting events  TV told stories  TV offered escapism  i e  an antidote to boredom  It was already obvious then that the first two jobs had been taken over by the Internet  only old people got their news from TV  and there was better and broader educational content on YouTube or any number of websites than TV could ever deliver  even with 200 channels  The question I asked then was how long TV could maintain its advantage when it came to the last three jobs   The disruption of TV will follow a similar path  a different category will provide better live sports  better story telling  or better escapism  Said category will steal attention  and when TV no longer commands enough attention of enough people  the entire edifice will collapse  Suddenly  I d bet on escapism being the next job we give to something else  for a few reasons  The economics of live sports are completely intertwined with the pay TV model  this will be the last pillar to crumble  Networks still play a crucial role in providing  venture funding  for great story telling  Netflix is the great hope here  Escapism is in some sense indiscriminate  it doesn t matter how our mind escapes  as long as it does  Yet it s also highly personal  the more tailored the escape  the more fulfilling  This is why there are hundreds of TV channels  However  there will never be as many TV channels as there are apps   I was right about escapism being on the verge of collapse  but the mechanism wasn t so much apps as it was one app  Facebook   Facebook  Snapchat  and Escapism  I wrote in The Facebook Epoch   The use of mobile devices occupies all of the available time around intent  It is only when we re doing something specific that we aren t using our phones  and the empty spaces of our lives are far greater than anyone imagined  Into this void   this massive market  both in terms of numbers and available time   came the perfect product  a means of following  communicating  and interacting with our friends and family  And  while we use a PC with intent  what we humans most want to do with our free time is connect with other humans  as Aristotle long ago observed   Man is by nature a social animal   It turned out Facebook was most people s natural habitat  and by most people I mean those billions using mobile   Snapchat is certainly challenging Facebook in this regard  and one of the most interesting questions to watch in 2017 is if this is the year both companies finally start to steal away not just TV s attention but also TV s advertising   Facebook is laying the groundwork to do just that  the company has been pushing video for a long time now  and recently added a dedicated video tab to its app  What has been missing  though  is an advertising unit that can actually compete with TV for brand advertising dollars  Facebook s current advertising options are  both in terms of format but also in their focus on fine toothed targeting  predominantly designed for direct marketing  Direct marketing has always been well suited for digital advertising  the point of the ad is to drive conversion  and digital is very good  not only at measuring if said conversion occurred  but also at targeting customers most likely to convert in the first place   Brand advertising is different  whereas direct marketing is focused at the bottom of the marketing funnel  brand advertising is about making end users aware of your product in the first place  or just building affinity for your brand as an investment in some future payoff  The mistake Facebook made for a long time was in trying to win brand marketing dollars by delivering direct marketing results  the company invested tons of time and money in trying to detect and track the connection between a brand focused advertisement and eventual purchase  which is not only technically difficult   what if the purchase takes place months in the future  or offline    but also completely misunderstood what mattered to brand advertisers   I noted above that brand advertisers find TV to deliver a superior return on investment  with its focus on tracking Facebook was too concerned with the  return  at the expense of the  investment   Specifically  taking advantage of Facebook s targeting and tracking capabilities requires the continual time and attention of marketers  it was far more efficient to simply create a television commercial that reached a bunch of people at once and then track lift after the fact  This is why Procter   Gamble  the biggest TV advertiser in the world  scaled back its targeting efforts on Facebook   Facebook is doing two things to change its value proposition for brand advertisers   First  the company is reportedly on the verge of rolling out a new video advertising unit that will play in the middle of videos   kind of like a TV commercial   Second  Facebook is focusing much more on being an advertising platform with massive scale than can also target   kind of like cable TV  but better   as opposed to a measurement machine that targets individuals and tracks them to the grocery store register   That last point may not seem like much but it s a noticeable shift  on last quarter s earnings call COO Sheryl Sandberg focused on the fact Facebook made it possible for brand advertisers to do  big brand buys on our platform like they would do on TV  but make them much more targeted    exactly one year earlier the pitch was  personalized marketing at scale  and  measuring ROI    I think this is the right shift for Facebook  but it also highlights why Snapchat is very much its rival  thanks to Facebook s ownership of identity the latter is unlikely to mount a serious challenge for direct marketing dollars  although it is   mistakenly in my opinion   building an app install product   however  if identity is less important for brand advertising than simply scale  then Snapchat s push for attention  particularly amongst young people  is very much a threat to Facebook   Not that that is much comfort to TV  Facebook and Snapchat have peeled off the  escapism  job in terms of attention  doing the same in terms of advertising is a question of when  not if   Netflix and Story Telling  Meanwhile  Netflix is proving to be far more than a  hope   as I described last year in Netflix and the Conservation of Attractive Profits  the company leveraged the commoditization of time enabled by streaming to own end users  creating the conditions to modularize suppliers   and that s exactly what is happening   What is interesting is that scripted TV is turning out very differently than music  instead of leveraging their back catalogs to maintain exclusivity on new releases  most networks sold the former to Netflix  giving the upstart the runway to compete and increasingly dominate the market for new shows  The motivation is obvious  networks have been far more concerned with protecting their lucrative paid TV revenue than with propping up their streaming initiatives  the big difference in music is that the labels  old album based business model had already been ruined  It s a lot easier to move into the future when there is nothing to lose   The Great Unbundling  The shift of both escapism and story telling away from traditional TV are noteworthy in their own rights  equally important  though  is that they are happening at the same time  Here is what the landscape looks like once TV is broken up into the different  jobs  it has traditionally done for viewers   First  the new winners have models that look a lot like the one that destroyed the publishing industry  by owning end users these companies either capture revenue directly  Netflix  or have compelling platforms for advertisers  content producers  meanwhile  are commoditized   Secondly  all four jobs were unbundled by different services  which is another way of saying there is no more bundle  That  by extension  means that one of the most important forces holding the TV ecosystem together is being sapped of its power  Bundling only makes sense if end users can get their second and third order preferences for less  what happens  though  if there are no more second and third order preferences to be had   To put this concept in concrete terms  the vast majority of discussion about paid TV has centered around ESPN specifically and sports generally  the Disney money maker traded away its traditional 90  penetration guarantee for a higher carriage fee  and has subsequently seen its subscriber base dwindle faster than that of paid TV as a whole  leading many to question its long term prospects   The truth  though  is that in the long run ESPN remains the most stable part of the cable bundle  it is the only TV  job  that  thanks to its investment in long term rights deals  is not going anywhere  Indeed  what may ultimately happen is not that ESPN leaves the bundle to go over the top  but that a cable subscription becomes a de facto sports subscription  with ESPN at the center garnering massive carriage fees from a significantly reduced cable base  And  frankly  that may not be too bad of an outcome   To be sure  it will take time for a lot of this analysis to play out  indeed  I ve long criticized cable cutting apostles for making the same prediction for going on 20 years  It s a lot easier to predict unbundling than to say when it will happen   or how   To that end  this is my best guess at the latter  as for when  the amount of change that has happened in just the last three years  since I wrote The Jobs TV Does  is substantial   and most of that change was simply laying the groundwork for actual shifts in behavior  Once those shifts start to happen in earnest there will be feedback loops in everything from advertising to content production to consumption that will only accelerate the changes  resulting in a transformed media landscape that will impact all parts of society  I m starting to agree that the end is nearer than many think,"[1256 765 1074 947 926 162 1375 435 1181 217 285]"
1272,training-dataset/product/580.txt,product,Designing media apps for Generation ZOne of WillowTree s most common target personas is the Millennial  and for good reason  Millennials are tech savvy  or at least tech dependent   brand agnostic  and comprise America s largest living generation   While research on Millennials abounds  we know far less about America s newest generation known as Generation Z  There is no consensus on Generation Z s exact age range  but members of the generation are usually considered to be born between the mid 1990s and early 2000s   Related  The definitive guide to building apps for children  It remains unclear when this generation officially  ends   but for the purpose of this post  we ll assume Generation Z includes anyone from 3 to 18 years old  What we do know about this generation is that they are socially and racially diverse  the first true digital natives  and are mobile first even more so than their Millennial forebears   We recently created an iOS  Android  and responsive web streaming experience that would appeal to the youngest group of Gen Z those between the ages of 3 12 years old  Our 2 key challenges were to create an experience that would be   Integrated with an existing on demand TV experience Appealing and usable by both 3 year olds and 12 year olds  This post details some of our key findings  We recognize there are drawbacks to designing a tablet experience that would appeal to both a 3 year old and an 11 year old  Still  we viewed this defined scope as an opportunity to test the limits of existing UI patterns for kids   Methods  In order to design the most inclusive Gen Z experience possible  we invited 20 kids  divided by age group  opens PDF   to visit our usability lab  Each child interacted with some of the more well known media apps  including Netflix  PBS Kids  and Nick Jr  There is little existing research on best practices for usability studies with kids  so we decided to write a blog post on what we learned from the experience   A few key takeaways from that piece include   Obtain consent Have a parent in the room Make a comfortable testing space Practice patience Don t worry about the cameras  It s also important to note that there are key distinctions between research on desktop and mobile tablet experiences  which made our study ever more important  We also armed ourselves with a few key research questions during testing   Do kids in this age cohort navigate in fundamentally different ways  Do all kids understand the concept of seasons  How does a 3 year old differ from an 11 year old in searching for a particular show   Finding  1   How  kids use their hands  Surprising to us  though perhaps less surprising to all the parents out there  was that our youngest cohort was skilled at tapping  zooming  and swiping on devices  In fact  one study by researchers at the University of Iowa found that 90  of kids at age 2 have moderate ability to use an iPad  Still  watching this in practice was enlightening and taught us that you don t need to  dumb down  the experience for children to understand it   For example  we asked one 3 year old to toggle a video to full screen  she almost naturally used a pinch to zoom gesture on the video  Our findings run contrary to existing research  which states that the  youngest of users  are more comfortable with taps than pinching  We theorize that kids have learned this gesture from enlarging photos on handheld devices  again  which they ve been using since they were able to grasp objects   While more research would need to confirm this finding  we recommend keeping the pinch to zoom gesture in your toolkit for any app designed for kids under the age of 5   We also discovered that even the youngest users knew how to scroll both vertically and horizontally  For example  Nick Jr  s app  which allows panning  may be fun  creative  and fluid but might also be unnecessary   In sum  we recommend the following for designing for ages 3 12   Leveraging pinch to zoom for enlarging video  Adhering to to existing UI guidelines for scrolling  Finding  2  Not all kids understand the concept of seasons  Nearly all TV shows are organized by season  We found that younger groups of kids  those younger than age 5  do not understand the concept of seasons  rather  they simply look for a show by recognizing characters  more on that in a moment    But don t worry too much  Kids as young 5 understand the concept of seasons and they were surprisingly adept at articulating the concept to us   Related  These 5 major UI mistakes will kill your app  Seasons are most likely not going anywhere  even if they don t necessarily mean the same thing as they used to  So what type of experience should you design if you want to appeal to both age groups  We recommend the ability to toggle between seasons or showing all the episodes in a series   Finding  3  Kids search differently  Even though seasons are critical for the older ages  the ability to simply search for a particular show remains king  Obviously  searching requires the ability to read and write  The youngest of kids  ages 3 5  will search for their favorite show by looking for and tapping on recognizable characters   Nick Jr   PBS Kids  Netflix  and a slew of other media apps follow this UI pattern in their navigation bars  interestingly  no reputable research confirms this finding  but we agree that it works   But kids of reading age want to be able to simply search for a show above anything else   We also found that kids over the age of 5 understood that the magnifying glass icon indicated they could search for something to watch by name   So again  if you re designing for kids ages 3 12  what do you build  First  we strongly recommend that you include a search bar or magnifying glass icon on each page to build the best Gen Z experience  We also recommend including highly visible characters  for those under age 5  as well as show titles under the character names  for those over age 5    Final thoughts and future research  There s a bit of research out there on designing experiences specifically for the youngest of users  We sought to build an experience that would appeal to a broad stroke of Generation Z  Here are a few key takeaways  if you re ever tasked with building such an experience   Always include search preferably on every page  The magnifying glass icon is sufficient  Don t fight against seasons  but realize that not all kids will understand the concept  Instead  allow some children to view an entire series in chronological order  Don t shy away from pinch to zoom  While tapping is indeed the most primary gesture  even kids as young as 3 are able to pinch to make a show full size   Our final experience incorporated all these features  And much to our delight  all of the kid testers enjoyed the look and feel of our designs   Future research should also look into patterns by gender  something we did not systematically analyze  Are girls more likely to interact with tablets differently than boys  Or  as Gen Z research suggests  are these binaries best left behind   Let s research and find out,"[1272 1346 252 885 685 1302 810 501 1196 135 623]"

simplest behavior in anticipation of a reward   Most addictive companies start out as toys    nice to haves     and seem inconsequential  Who thought Facebook would be as big as it is today  back when it launched  But as they grow  they end up  touching 100 000 000s of users and making billions   says Nir   The hooks   now nearly infinite   of Facebook are it s news feed  and to a lesser extent  the positive surprise of messages or seeing likes on posts  The same goes for Twitter  through likes and retweets  In comparison  social networks that are more static and have less novel activities are less likely to maintain hooks on users   A great hook doesn t have to achieve anything concrete  The simpler  the better  It s an experience designed to influence a user to interact with your platform often enough to form a habit   and it s the core of any addictive company   Nir believes we re at in an era where we can help people use these habits for good  and lead happier and more productive lives  However  users and entrepreneurs should be aware that   like any addiction   great hooks work regardless of the intent  or the results   If it can t be used for evil  it s not a super power   quotes Nir   The Psychology of Addictive Products  Every hook starts with two types of triggers  external and internal   External Triggers tell you what to do next based on outside info  Think features like notifications  buttons  arrows reminding you to scroll  and more blunt techniques like the constant email reminders we love to hate   Internal Triggers are more critical   and also ignored by most product designers  These are the true reasons that prompt us to action  but the information for what to do is not obvious digitally  Rather  Internal triggers are stored as associations inside the user s brain   This isn t like the mind manipulation seen in Inception  but rather the creation of irresistible user experiences  It s knowing how people feel  and what changes those feelings on a temporary and transient basis  Internal triggers work best when there s a persistent  recurring negative emotion  the trigger gives brief relief from that emotion  creating an addiction   The simplest behaviors in anticipation of a reward   A Pinterest scroll  which might turn up an interesting photo   A Google search  which might teach us something new   A Play button on YouTube  which can capture our interest for a few minutes   All of these are simple actions tied to an immediate reward   The strongest triggers  Nir says  are when we feel  Bored  lonely  confused  fearful  lost or indecisive    These  statistically  inspire the most action  Slot machines  anyone   Is Depression the Best Teacher   Nir cited studies like those of Sriram Chellappan  who showed unique traffic patterns in how depressed people surf the web  Other studies found that social media usage creates anxiety  leading us to ask  are the platforms with the best hooks both creating the need  and giving relief   If so  that s genius  and also terrifying   Nir believes we can understand this phenomenon by what psychologists call  More valent states   They feel down more often than most of the population  They check email to get out of that state   If we re honest with ourselves  we all use products to modulate our mood  when someone s feeling lonely  they check Facebook  when someone s feeling unsure  they go to Google  when bored  people check YouTube  sports scores  news  and Pinterest   All of these solutions take us from the unpleasant situation of boredom and give us relief  Before the emotion becomes conscious  the behavior is already occurring  Indeed  the lack of conscious awareness is key to sustaining a hook   If you primarily check Pinterest when you re bored  what happens if you  through  say  meditation or therapy  reduce your overall negative emotions  Will you cut out your Pintrest use   Not likely  if Pinterest s hook is working right   When Nir consults and asks   What s the psychological need of the product   he said most founders don t know  To achieve scale scale   You need to absolutely understand the emotional trigger in your user s life    Case Study  Instagram  Instagram s external triggers are easy to spot   Check out my photo on Instagram    To help the audience understand Instagram s internal triggers  Nir asked an audience member about the last photo she took   The beach   she said   Why take that photo  The beach was so beautiful  the experience so precious  that underlying the action  Nir asserted  was an internal fear of losing the moment  Instagram catered to that fear  relieving it by capturing it   The good  Here s a clear victory behind helping people experience more positive emotions   The bad  Once you believe a digital action can make you feel better  you might ignore the bigger picture   The ugly  That bigger picture might be soaking in the experience deeply  allowing it to change you   or looking at your life and perceptions of it  getting to the deep psychological root of why the fear arose in the first place  Instagram can only help a small amount here  and the results are fleeting  While apps with great hooks can give us relief  psychologically  they only medicate a symptom   not cure it   This leads to an interesting ethical dilemma  To make a truly effective hook  we have to capitalize on users  negative emotions  To keep them using the product  their negative emotions  and thus the need relief  need to stick around   The more we use Instagram s hook  the more we attach it to other internal triggers  whether fear  boredom  or the fear of missing out  The solution to that discomfort is found with this app in our pocket  The more we use Instagram  the more we associate it with more triggers  thus inspiring us to want to use it more   This helps apps Instagram because it makes us want to find emotional release from multiple sources  If we suddenly become fearless  we d still log in to find relief   Creating the Formula for Getting Hooked  For any human behavior  Nir says  Behaviors   Motivation   Ability   Trigger  So how  as founders and product designers  increase the odds that our app becomes a behavior  By increasing the variables  naturally   Increasing Motivation  6 Tactics to Make Your App Addictive  Think about how you can introduce these motivators into your product   1  Seeking pleasure   2  Avoiding pain  3  Seeking hope  4  Avoiding fear  5  Seeking acceptance  6  Avoiding rejection  Every piece of marketing copy uses at least one of these six core motivations  thus making the triggered behavior more likely to occur   Nir revealed  Companies with great hooks often don t look to the 20th century model of advertising  Facebook and Slack didn t advertise in the Superbowl  The ads don t bring people in  the experiences themselves create habits   which are far more powerful  and far more valuable   Increasing Ability  Lowering Barriers to Addicting Behaviors  A click or scroll is incredibly easy and fast  thus more or less likely to occur   Complicated and expensive actions increase the activation cost of a behavior  and make it harder to understand  thus less likely to occur  If you can do something simply  quickly  and cheaply  without complex thought  you re more likely to do it again  and again  and again   When a user has enough motivation and ability  and is presented with the trigger when a motivation is present  it often succeeds   but it cannot be so challenging that it demands more motivation than the user has  When motivation is too low and ability requirements are too high  the trigger fails  The solution  then  is to remove obstacle in your customer s way  maybe that means eliminating the  first name  last name  fields in your email capture  taking out a step in your product purchase process  or placing a shortcut to the desired action in a more visible location    All technology is about shortening the distance between the recognition of the need and the reward    Triggers   Rewards  Make Acting Valuable  but Unpredictable  In habit forming products  there s mystery  variability and uncertainty on what you might find when you use a product  When you scroll through images on Pinterest or updates on Facebook  you know you ll get something   but you don t know exactly what  or when   Nir highlighted behavioral psychologist BF Skinner and discussed examples of pigeons pecking at a disk to get food  Instead of getting food at every single peck  predictable   Skinner found something else  the rate of response   the number of times pigeons pecked at the disk   increased when the reward happened at a variable schedule of reinforcement  That is  almost randomly   The point of variable rewards is to give users what they came for  Scratch the user s itch  and leave them wanting more   but don t reveal your hand to let them know how far between they are between rewards  like with drops of good equipment in video games   We may  as the masses  seem like easy to fool creatures  but by studying what forms and maintains habits   along with what can break them   we can often learn more about ourselves at the deepest level  Want to master your own habits  Then read Hooked deeply  and prepare yourself against the onslaught on your attention by knowing their tricks,"[1286

1296,training-dataset/business/1012.txt,business,If Snap s Strategy Is Building New Products  It Won t Live Up to Its IPO PriceIn light of Snap s IPO  there has been an immense amount of speculation about the long term viability of the company s strategy  Two elements of it have caught some attention  Snap s statement that it is a  camera company   and its intention to reinvest its revenues in developing new products that will take significant time and expense  but which it believes it can develop faster than competitors   How should you interpret the viability of Snap s strategy amid the many opinions  The cacophony of commentaries isn t unique to Snap  it also infects the general view of digital and digital transformation  The conventional wisdom holds that every industry is being disrupted and all the rules have changed  But have they  A close look at the core ideas of technology strategy suggests that beneath the sound and the fury lies a set of fundamental principles that can guide leaders in making smart choices  These same principles can help cut through some of the confusion around the viability of Snap s strategy  I ll share four of these principles here   Don t Confuse Products and Platforms  Products and platforms are fundamentally different  but easily confused  In the digital era  platforms are typically more valuable than products  This sounds simple  but most of the large companies I work with are making the mistake of focusing on products rather than platforms  A review of their strategy documents reveals that they talk about their digital transformation in terms of creating engaging digital products  not platforms  But the real value in the digital era comes from the platforms that facilitate interaction   To see why products are less valuable than platforms  ask yourself a simple question  Would you rather be one of 2 million apps  i e   products  competing in the App Store  or would you rather be the App Store  i e   a platform   You d prefer to be the App Store  because products require immense time  capital  and resources to develop and must compete through differentiation to make a one time sale  or at best a recurring subscription revenue stream  By contrast  platforms don t actually sell anything  no inventory   they simply facilitate the interactions  and by so doing take a cut of hundreds  millions  even billions of transactions  Put another way  platforms are the kings and queens of the digital era  whereas products are the serfs who work the land   Why do so many large and successful companies make this mistake  Because in the pre digital era so many of the opportunities were product opportunities  In the digital era  as products become software and the boundaries between products become data  there are more opportunities than ever to build platforms  Of course  there will be some products that are immensely valuable  and of course they are worth pursuing  But if a platform opportunity exists  leaders should focus their efforts there  By some measures  60 of the world s most valuable 100 companies are built on platforms   Snap is a perfect example  The reason the company is so valuable is it has a platform with over 150 million users  But one reason for concern is that Snap s S 1 talks about developing  products   and in terms commonly used by product companies  they will require immense time and effort  compete through differentiation  etc    Perhaps Snap means  platforms  when it says  products   or features that support the platform  But a digital strategist should know  Products are good  platforms are much better   Don t Neglect the Core Interaction  When you look at the most successful platforms today  such as LinkedIn  Facebook  iTunes  and the various app stores  you see dozens of actions and features  But the real value of a platform rests on one or two core interactions  The remaining features are frosting  added later  that should enhance or protect the core interaction  If added products and features obscure the core interaction or the core interaction loses its value  the platform will fail   To illustrate  ask yourself  what is the core interaction for Myspace  It s hard to answer because the core became obscured over time  Initially it was connecting with friends  but it soon became overtaken by music  and users started to complain that whenever they logged into Myspace they would be inundated by messages from unknown bands  The core interaction lost its value and Myspace fell behind Facebook  which provided a stronger core interaction   The questions asked about Snap s strategy should be  What is its core interaction  how sustainable is it  and how do its investments protect and multiply the value of that core interaction  Informal feedback suggests that Snapchat users value that the service makes it easier than competitors to keep in touch with friends  while the impermanence of the content  you can only view messages for a short window of time  lowers the bar for looking good  creating a more casual experience  This core interaction has value  as evidenced by the millions of members who have joined  But I am more interested in how Snap s investments will protect and multiply this core value   Software Platforms vs  Hardware Architectures  One reason Snap may have declared that it s a camera company is that it sees the immense potential in augmented reality  AR  and virtual reality  VR   But a camera is not a platform  it is an architecture  although often mislabeled a platform   What is the difference  An architecture  typically hardware  defines how components fit together and the interfaces between them  like the architecture that defines how your iPhone  laptop  or car fits together   Platforms  by contrast  can be hardware but are typically software  and facilitate interactions  The easiest way to tell the difference is the business model  Architectures are sold like products  while platforms earn money based on the cut of each interaction they facilitate  Thus the iPhone is an architecture  how the camera  chip  glass  and other features fit together  that hosts platforms  the App Store and iTunes   The platform could be separated from the hardware  as is the case for Android   The problem with defining the camera as the platform of the future is that it is really a piece of hardware  and products like a Snapchat headset sound like products with architectures  not platforms  Hardware can host platforms  just as an Xbox hosts the interaction of gamers and game producers  But the challenge of building platforms resting on hardware  like a camera  is that the most savvy technology strategists are actually trying hard to commoditize hardware based platforms in favor of software based platforms   For example  while Facebook spent  2 billion on Oculus Rift  which depends on hardware  Google has been trying to commoditize the hardware element of virtual reality with the  15 Google Cardboard  which makes software the platform for VR  Google is trying to do the same in AR  Although it is working with hardware manufacturers today  its vision is to commoditize the hardware platforms and win with software platforms   As you interpret the  camera company  strategy  the question then becomes  where will the real platform be at the end of the competition  In the hardware  camera   or in the software   Turn Products into Platforms  Finally  products can end up being valuable platform opportunities  Although platforms are the gold standard of the digital era  many companies have products  not platforms  Turning products into platforms can be one of the best strategies for creating new platforms  Doing so often requires a great product and a hybrid business model  If Snap intends to build products as a bridge to new platforms  or as an effort to create a hybrid business model more robust than its current platform business model  that may make sense  But this isn t immediately clear from the documentation   So  how should you judge the viability of Snap s strategy  If you believe the company is  1  mistakenly placing its focus on easily imitated products  rather than platforms   2  losing sight on its core interaction  and  3  building on hardware platforms that will one day be commoditized  then you might be worried about Snap  On the other hand  if you think Snap s  product  language is code for defensible  value added additions to the core platform interaction  which you believe it can deliver  and that it is building bridges to future platforms with its camera strategy  then you have cause to be optimistic about its long term viability   Either way  Snap has accomplished a great deal to this point and is an amazing example of the opportunity available in an easily overlooked core interaction and the incredible value of the platform built upon it,"[1296 1242 346 402 874 1170 55 764 1367 412 285]"
1302,training-dataset/product/955.txt,product,Intuitive Design vs  Shareable Design   Greylock PerspectivesIntuitive Design vs  Shareable Design  Snapchat s interface baffles a lot of people  Not to pick on older folks  but people over a certain age tend to have a hard time figuring out how to do the most basic things with Snapchat  like finding its face swap feature  I can t tell you how many people have whined to me about Snapchat   Oh  I can t figure it out   they cry   Why is it so complicated    I m here to tell you that the obscurity of Snapchat s design is not a bug  it s a feature  Just like Tinder  it s a design that s made to engage people and encourage them to share their experiences with others  In fact  it is a key part of what has made Snapchat so successful   Snapchat is one of the greatest examples of what I call  shareable design   For those who grew up thinking of  intuitive design  as the ultimate ideal  this new approach is a little jarring  But it makes perfect sense once you understand how it works   The Intuitive Design Revolution  I don t mean to denigrate intuitive design  In fact  when intuitive design emerged in the 1980s  it was a huge leap forward over the previous generation of computer interfaces  from the 1960s and 1970s  which were complex  unintuitive  and required a lot of training to use  Those interfaces relied on you memorizing large lists of commands and recalling the right one at the right time  People took a lot of pride in how many commands and parameters they could memorize without having to use the  man  command to look up the manual   Graphical User Interfaces  GUIs  were a huge leap forward  Unlike users of mainframes or minicomputers  who worked on teams in designated computer rooms  PC users were at home or in their own office  trying to figure out the computer and its software on their own  They didn t have time to read a manual or take a class in order to learn how to use a new piece of software  Someone would just sit at their desk  launch a piece of software like a spreadsheet program  and hopefully be able to figure it out  The software that companies made for this market had to be so intuitive that you could discover how to use it on your own   Old Microsoft Excel Toolbars  Microsoft  for instance  spent a huge amount of time figuring out how to make software more intuitively designed  We can argue about how successful they were aesthetically  but programs like Excel succeeded in the market because they had a lot of ways that users could discover their features just by clicking around  That s what led to toolbars and menu bars and the like  They were ugly  but they worked  because they were intuitive  enough   And  well  if they weren t easy enough  people would then buy books to teach them step by step  I spent one summer internship at a company named Catapult Press as a  tester  for Microsoft Step by Step books learning this in the most tedious way as I went through the books looking for errors   In that era  Apple spent a lot of time figuring out how to make its operating system as intuitive as possible  Apple published a book outlining its Human Interface Guidelines in 1987  which became hugely influential through the Macintosh era and even into the Internet era   All this work was based on research done by brilliant software and product designers of the 1980s and 1990s  Don Norman s Design of Everyday Things was very influential among software designers  even though it was focused on industrial design  the design of physical objects   Brenda Laurel s book The Art of Human Computer Interface Design was published in 1990  and it s still on my bookshelf  These books were groundbreaking works  and their influence continues to this day   Mobile Makes Everything Physical and Social  When the tech world started becoming mobile focused in 2008  everything changed  Suddenly  software designers were no longer targeting people who are sitting at a desk  working by themselves  They were making apps  whose users are on their phones  out and about in the world  often surrounded by other people  friends  family  classmates  and coworkers   Physical gestures like swiping  zooming  and tapping are natural and human   The shift to mobile has created two complementary new trends in interface design  One is the move toward more physical gestures  Because you re touching the software with your fingers instead of manipulating it with a mouse or a keyboard  it feels immediately much more human  Even children get this  Just watch this video of a baby trying to tap and zoom with magazine pages because they want it to work just like an iPad  Swiping  pinching  zooming  tapping  All of these types of direct manipulation simulate natural human body gestures  I wrote a post a couple of years ago about how  Generation Touch  connects differently with products they use because they interact directly   The second shift  and this is what many interface designers don t yet understand  is that people learn how to do things in the real world by watching others  The way most 18 year olds learn how to use a new app is by watching their friends  It s right there  on their friend s phone  so they just pull the phone out and show them something   This is actually a return to the way we ve always learned to do things in the world  You learned to throw a ball  pick up a cup  tie your shoes  and open a door by watching others  When you were older you probably learned how to ride a bike or drive a car by having someone show you how to do it  So if software is more physical now  in app form   why shouldn t we learn how to do it by watching other people   Do you want to know how to use Snapchat  Toparaphrase Groucho Marx  it s easy  Just find a teenager to show you  Someone who uses the app a lot can show you everything from how to take a picture and draw on it to using filters  getting the secret pen colors like black and white  use face swap  add friends with a QR code  and more   Enter Shareable Design  Shareable design understands this deeply social nature of how humans learn  and capitalizes on people s desires to learn and to teach   Snapchat does this brilliantly  because each of those seemingly obscure features is an opportunity for its users to show their friends how to do something cool  Showing your friends something cool can increase your social standing  or maybe it just gives you a good feeling  Either way it s something you want to do  And for Snapchat  that s great  because it s converting you into an evangelist for its product  and you don t even feel like you re evangelizing  You re just showing your friends how to do something neat   Musical ly videos are shared widely on Instagram  Facebook  and Twitter   Sharing like this doesn t have to happen in person either  Musical ly first grew in 2015 as a cool app for making fun music videos  When people shared their Musical ly videos on Instagram or Facebook  you would often see their friends asking how they made that  That gives people the opportunity to say   Oh  I used Musical ly  And as it spread from person to person  and through influencers  Musical ly grew rapidly   In addition to encouraging sharing  this kind of design has two other benefits  One  it makes features particularly memorable  If someone shows you how to use your iPhone to do a long press on a person s name so a menu pops up allowing you to save their information to your contacts  that knowledge sticks with you  It s a physical memory combined with a social memory  so it stays   The other benefit is that these features don t take up any screen space  A mobile phone has as pretty small screen  so the amount of screen real estate that you can devote to buttons or icons is very  very small  Obviously  the button filled toolbars of a 1990s Windows app are not going to work here  But  invisible  features like a long press  a 3D Touch  deep  press  or a swipe down from the top of the screen take no screen real estate at all   We don t yet have any great books on shareable design  although some designers  like Luke Wroblewski  have written a lot of smart articles on mobile design that get at some of these concepts  And  of course  there are apps and operating systems whose designers clearly get this philosophy  Snapchat  Prisma  the latest versions of iOS  and even to a certain extent Twitter   I would love to see more people researching and writing about shareable design  It s an important area and it s going to become even more important as we move forward into a world filled with wearables  augmented reality  and an even wider variety of mobile devices  If you have any great examples  please get in touch,"[1302 685 217 447 623 1166 840 252 1181

1307,training-dataset/business/1449.txt,business,Cognitive Overhead is Your Product s Overlord   Topple it With These TipsDavid Lieb knew his company Bump was going to take off when strangers dressed up as the app for Halloween  While at the University of Chicago  he built the app so he could more easily exchange contact information with new classmates by physically bumping their phones together  Bump was no blip  The app exploded  It was downloaded 150 million times and hit  2 in the App Store  Apple even featured Bump in a commercial that aired on prime time television   Five years after Bump launched  Google bought it  Lieb  now the Product Lead at Google Photos  learned a lot about what drove and deterred users at Bump  For instance  the team added photo sharing on a whim  When users began bumping photos  the team built a new app  Flock  to simplify the process  It predicted the photos users wanted to share and could transfer them without physical contact   a much more frictionless experience than Bump  But it flopped   Drawing from his talk at First Round s CEO Summit  Lieb identifies what Flock crystallized for him  the risk of cognitive overload  He defines the phenomenon  explains why it matters and shares how to test for it  To help his fellow product leads and teams suffering from it  he dispels four myths about cognitive overload   and how to keep it from holding back your products   Cognitive Simplicity vs  Cognitive Overhead  Technology aside  at the core of Bump s success was the simple act of touching two phones together  It was straightforward and repeatable   even executed without explanation   Yes  it s true that simplicity in products is not a new idea  For decades  some of the most successful products would be best described as simple   says Lieb   But simplicity comes in many dimensions  the number of buttons on an interface  number of features  steps in a flow or time it takes to complete a decision  and more  But the dimension that matters most is cognitive simplicity  how easy your product is to understand    Cognitive simplicity has its nemesis  cognitive overload   I like this definition that I found on the internet  Cognitive overhead is the number of logical connections that your brain has to make to contextualize and understand what it sees  Now I m no brain scientist  but I am pretty good at googling stuff  and I found all sorts of research around human cognition and evolution  There s a notion that the brain works by grouping objects and ideas it encounters into abstractions  and then considering those abstractions relative to things it already knows   says Lieb   Let me give you an example  early humans saw what happens when a lion runs toward something  Bad things  right  Those who were able to abstract this occurrence into an understanding that anytime an object rapidly approaches  it s probably not a good thing  well  they tended to live longer and pass this brain structure down to their descendants    So our brains are hardwired to operate this way   to abstract things and concepts relative to known things and concepts   and the more jumps we make our brains go through  the harder it is to use a product   Now  yes  for the most part  we don t have lions attacking us anymore but  consider this  A few decades ago  your users were on a desktop  looking at your website with a big dedicated screen  There was ample time to understand your complex product  No distractions  no lions attacking   says Lieb   Mobile has changed all that  Today  I m walking  dodging a car and opening your app for the first time   all while getting a text message  email alert and Twitter notification  A lot s happening on a screen that s magnitudes smaller than a desktop  This new infusion of distraction makes cognitive simplicity more critical than ever    David Lieb at First Round s CEO Summit  Root Out Cognitive Overhead From Your Products  No one intends to build a product with large cognitive overhead  but it happens if there isn t forethought and recognition for it   We saw the value being added with Flock s predictive abilities   and a small group of users really loved them   but it was a cognitive maze for the rest of the world   says Lieb   The moment you assume people understand the value you re adding   especially when it s a new concept   you dive into cognitive overhead territory    Here Lieb outlines four assumptions you re unknowingly making and how to resolve them   Assumption  1  It s best to make choices for your users whenever possible   Reality  Involve users in decisions  It increases their understanding and engagement   The rise of bots  AI  and machine learning enable products to automatically make better and more decisions for users  It s part of the quest for less friction and fewer steps in products  But according to Lieb  the opposite may be better  help your users become part of the process   it s what they want    The most successful products make people work more  It seems counterintuitive  but make your user press an extra button  or extend a flow that you can capture in a single screen into three   says Lieb   The more choices your user makes within your product  especially ones you could have made for them  the easier it is to use and understand    Users shouldn t sit on the sidelines  nor do heavy lifting in apps  Go in between  Make them roll up their sleeves   Lieb saw this play out with Bump and Flock   With Bump  people literally had to be in arm s length to share their contact information  It was incredibly high friction but it empowered them by putting them in charge of the process  They knew exactly what was going on and how to do it   Lieb recalls   In Flock  people couldn t figure out how we determined the photos they wanted to share  They were so far removed from the process that they didn t want to partake in the outcome  We learned that required action doesn t just personalize user experience  It defines it    Lieb notes the same behavior at play with Google Photos and its  Free Up Space  feature  It s designed to counter that dreaded  You don t have enough storage to take this photo  popup that emerges as you re trying to capture a special memory  The feature is essentially a button that  when pressed  deletes any photos that are already backed up to Google Photos  It s become one of Google Photos  most popular features    You don t have to be an engineer to know there s a simpler way to perform this process  The app could automatically remove images and videos from your phone that are backed up elsewhere  In fact  one of our competitors actually does this  It s called Optimized Device Storage   says Lieb   Issue is that it s way more complex cognitively because people feel like they aren t in control  They end up asking questions like  Where are my photos  Oh no  have they been deleted  How and when did they decide which to remove  What is going on  The last thing you want is for users to think you deleted a photo of their wedding or a video of their child s first steps  Most automated features leave your users confused rather than reassured    Lieb s recommendation  Map out if  when  and how you are going to automate a feature  Ask others what that feature does to get at the  why   Analyze not just each user action  but their corresponding reaction  Just because something seems simpler doesn t mean it is   Assumption  2  It s best to delight your users with first of its kind features   Reality  Familiarity is the top driver of adoption   Have you ever heard a visionary design leader calling for a product to look and feel ordinary  It might feel like the antithesis of innovation  but it s actually the underlying driver of adoption   Our brain contextualizes and abstracts new things relative to known things  So by making your product look and feel somewhat like the product it s replacing  you can actually help users understand it   Lieb says   This doesn t imply that you should replicate other products  It just means that you have to be thoughtful about how you differentiate your features and the way you reveal them  Inherit base level comprehension by positioning your product relative to a known product and then weave new features in as your users advance through the flow    Lieb s team learned the power of recognition at Flock  As a refresher  the first iteration predicted the photos you d want to send to friends and delivered them through the app   In a later  more sticky version of Flock  we were able to showcase the unique value we were adding was by starting with a familiar experience  There was no reason to burden them with understanding yet another photo app  So we showed them their photos in a gallery that replicated their native photo album   says Lieb   Then when we prompted them to deliver the photos in an unfamiliar way  it felt like a smarter continuation of something familiar  rather than a new series of actions throughout  We improved our product by better getting them to what felt new without bailing    Build products that trigger a d j  vu feeling over a  Eureka   moment  The latter soon fades  The former links and syncs with a memory or context   Lieb s recommendation  Examine how your users navigate your product  from the sign up flow to feature execution  Then ask them two questions   What is this app or product for   How do you use it    There s a twist  You need to ask these questions to a very particular group of people  those that are really sensitive to cognitive overhead   canaries in a coalmine  so to speak   says Lieb   Your best cognitive overhead detectors are the young and old  The brains of these two groups haven t developed the product pattern matching abilities that those of us designing products take for granted  If you test on these types of users  and they can understand and explain to you what your products are for and how to use it  you re in excellent shape  My star beta testers are my parents and my nephew    If you don t have older and younger users to test your products  there s one more solution   If you are short these two types of users  there is a third option  You ll find them at your local watering hole   says Lieb   I m dead serious about this one  Drunk people are great approximations for cognitively challenged people that you ll encounter in the real world  who are really distracted  busy  or fickle  At Bump  we would actually take teams to bars in Palo Alto and San Francisco  and have people use the app in front of us  Then we d ask them what Bump is for  and how to use it  It worked out really well     Look at your own products and see if they pass the young  old  and drunk test  If not  think about ways you could slow your product down  or how you can make your user do more work  or how you can make it look and feel a little more ordinary   says Lieb   Who are your best cognitive overhead detectors for your products  The young  the old and the drunk   Assumption  3  Diverse features lead to a highly engaged user base   Reality  Build for consistency   not variety   to form habits   Product teams are frequently tempted to build more functionality into a product to increase the probability of an addictive feature   one that ll keep users coming back for more  Yet a multiplicity of features increases cognitive overload and makes it more difficult to cleanly answer the question  What is this product for   Lieb analyzes features from two products that billions of people use daily to explain where they land on the cognitive overhead spectrum   so you can benchmark your own product   WhatsApp    WhatsApp prizes cognitive simplicity  I remember sitting down with founder Jan Koum in 2013 when voice and video calling were becoming prominent  Other messaging apps were rushing to build APIs and talking up cool new features   says Lieb   He was unapologetic when he said the product was built for messaging and the team would remain solely focused on delivering that experience  They didn t add voice calling for two years  You rarely see WhatsApp show up in designers  conversations on Dribbble  You can even call it the ugliest messaging app out there  but as of February 2016 it had 1 billion users who sent 42 billion messages a day  The team prioritizes cognitive simplicity and it shows    Twitter Moments   Twitter Moments is on the other side of the spectrum  When Jack Dorsey took over  he wanted to make Twitter as easy to use as looking out your window  They attempted to achieve this through Moments  curated collections of digestible tweets   including images and videos   about trending topics   says Lieb   I loved Moments and enjoyed using it  but from a cognitive perspective it clouded the water around what Twitter is and why it exists  Creating a Moment or browsing them was entirely different than drafting a tweet or scrolling through your feed  When you d click on the page as a first time user you were left with questions like  Is this website for news  Who is creating the collections  Am I supposed to create them or follow others  There are too many unknowns  As a result  visitors may never make it to the core product and discover what it has offer  In January 2017  Moments was folded into the Explore function on Twitter    Lieb s recommendation  Choose your lane and stay in it   for your users  sake  Reid Hoffman once said that most people use about 7   give or take 2   web products daily  Breaking into that cycle is supremely difficult  Especially early on  double down on consistency  so if and when you break into that rotation  you reliably deliver on your promise  meet expectations and retain users  attention   Assumption  4  Speed wins   Reality  Time instills trust and quality   App developers are often all about speed and faster performance  but adding a few seconds to your workflow can help users gain a better sense of what s happening under the hood   Research has shown how this phenomenon works on travel websites  When users can see a platform working for them  searching all of their competitors to find the very best deals  they believe the results are more exhaustive and valuable   says Lieb   After all  the site s crawling the entire web  a feat we could never achieve on our own  But the search doesn t take as long as is shown  By slowing it down  users have a chance to process the work being done for them    Take QR codes   See one  bring out your phone and scan it  They were designed for speed  but dropped the ball on cognitive simplicity   says Lieb   It doesn t matter if it can be done quickly if you don t know what it is  Users ask  Is it a barcode  No  A website  Okay  So I ll use my browser  No  Oh  I have to take a picture of it  got it  Ok  I ll take my camera  Oh wait  I can t use my camera  I have to use an app  Okay  which app  That all happens in under a minute  It s a cognitive disaster    Lieb s recommendation  Moving the user along a millisecond faster isn t always the goal  Ask yourself what choices can you make to increase user recognition  Would a few more seconds give your user time to consider the value you re adding  That may teach them how you re doing it and why it matters  A B test features and look for an uptick in repeated behavior  Optimize for your user navigating more quickly   indicating comprehension and confidence   not your app   Tying The Tactics Together  In summary  here s Lieb s three techniques to help you  help your users  reduce cognitive overhead in your products,"[1307 623 1318 252 840 885 411 810 1321 882 1023]"

1318,training-dataset/product/805.txt,product,Best Practices for Onboarding   UX PlanetCredits  chargify  Best Practices for Onboarding  by Nick Babich  Getting people to sign up for the product is tough  It requires a lot of time  energy  and money  yet many products are losing most of those hard won users immediately after their first time experience  According to the Andrew Chen research   The average app loses 77  of its daily active users within the first 3 days post install  Businesses invest so much in acquiring new users  only to lose majority of them immediately after their very first visit  You definitely don t want your company be one of them  But how can you do better  You need to make a great first impression by creating a perfect onboarding process   Onboarding is a human resources term was borrowed by UX designers as a way of getting someone  up and running  with a site  app  or service  It s the process of increasing the likelihood that first time users become full time user when adopting your product   There are a number of considerations when you are designing your onboarding to define how best to get your users familiar with your product and its value   Avoid Long Up Front Tutorials  Reduce a friction on a user s journey by following a simple rule  show less  provide more   Almost every app on the market today has a swipe through tutorial shown on the first launch  It aims to introduce what an app does to a user   Static screens suppose to demonstrate the value of the product  Credits  Min  Or educate users how to interact with app by explaining the most common actions   Clear  a to do app for iOS  asks users to read a 7 screen tutorial before they can start doing anything with the app   A number of problems exist with these long swipe through tutorial   value proposition tours that we see in many apps   A swipe through screens are momentum killers  They inject a barrier between new users and the app  Even when the tutorial beautifully designed or seemed fun  users don t have the patience to sit through it  Why  Because most users want to start exploring the app on their own  They want to first establish a relationship with the app  see what it is about   Users cannot be expected to read a manual before using your app  People do not launch an app to spend time learning how to use the interface  all they want is to complete a task in as short an amount of time as possible  So don t make your users feel like they have to study in order to use your app   Make Onboarding Contextual  Rather than asking your users to remember everything up front  you should provide guidance as they go  Up front tutorials have another usability focused problem  they require users to work upfront   users have to patiently read all the information and try to commit it to their memory  Even if they decide to read the instructions  they usually forget everything as soon as they close the overlay  unfortunately  our short term memory cannot retain very much information    Expecting users to remember every available function before they have even seen the app or site is obviously too much  New users don t sign up for your product because they are excited about learning how your UI works  They signed up because they were interested in the value that you promised to deliver   A contextual  or just in time  onboarding approach is a good alternative of static screen by screen tutorial  It s a way to provide helpful information at the point of action  the guidance you offer is specific to the user s current point in the journey and you show only the information necessary at that point in the interaction  It s a simple  yet powerful design technique which can be implemented in many different ways   Sample data  A  Welcome Board  is the first thing user sees in task management app Trello  This board includes pre populated to do list items  with each item explaining a different interaction or feature within the app  This approach allows users to learn features much more effectively than a static screen   Trello easing customers into the product quickly  It shows what using it would actually be like   Focused Tips  Contextual tips can be found in YouTube app for Android  App minimizes the amount of instructions by focusing users  attention on a single  primary action  It uses instructional overlay to explain an unfamiliar interaction  but these hints appear on the first launch for new users  one at a time  as the user reaches the relevant section of the app   Instructions in apps must be designed for optimal scannability  as users tend to dismiss them quickly   Interactive tour is a user guided tour where hints are only triggered when the user reaches the appropriate point in their experience  Thus  hints may appear in different orders for different users  Duolingo knows that learning by doing things is the best way to learn and uses an interactive way of progressive disclosure to show users how the app works  Users are encouraged to jump in and do a quick test in the selected language   Duolingo has a user guided tour which consists of a quick test  Tip  Including visuals alongside written instructions allow users to get the basic idea of what to do without reading very much   Maximize Empty States  Consider a  first use  empty state as part of a cohesive onboarding experience  Content is what provides value for most apps and websites  It s why people are using them   for the content  Thus  it s critical to consider how we design empty states  those places in the experience where a user might not have content yet   Empty state is a very natural point to inject some onboarding to continue guiding users along  Instead of leaving it blank  you should use it efficiently  to guide  educate  and prompt   Good empty turns a moment of nothing into something  Encourage users to engage with your product   Help them get comfortable by setting expectations for what ll happen   Provide an obvious way to move forward to that next step   For example  the first page users see after signing up for Instagram is empty  Other profiles have photos  likes and comments  but first time user s account is full of nothing   0 posts  0 followers  0 following  To make the activation easier  Instagram has turned this  empty state  into a learning opportunity  where you would normally see your photos  it says  No Posts Yet   Tap on the camera to share your first photo or video  with an arrow pointing to the camera option   Instagram knows that the first goal with an empty state is to teach people how to use your app  Tips  Deliver the information in a show or tell format    show  the user what the screen will look like when it s populated with sample data  or  tell  them with a written explanation   Introduce Success States  Let your users feel great when they get to their first win  The moment a user completes an important task is a great opportunity for you to create a positive emotional connection between them and your product  Let your users know that they are doing great by acknowledging their progress and   Celebrate success with the user  For example  MailChimp  a web service for creating and sending emails  rewards users for creating and scheduling their first e mails by adding unexpected humor and positivity throughout the process   Mailchimp s design communicates emotion in all its forms  Tip  Use success states as an opportunity to really let your personality shine   Measure   Constantly iterate and measure everything  Metrics are crucial when looking at whether your current user onboarding is successful and in figuring out where it needs improvement  You should define an activation metric and get serious about tracking the inputs to that metric  Before you begin any new onboarding project you should ask yourself  How does this project increase our activation metric    Get Inspired  Great resources for exploring existing onboarding experiences is UserOnboard  created by UX designer Samuel Hulick  His detailed descriptions of the user onboarding process in popular apps give designers an idea about how some of the most successful apps in the world keep you from quitting   How Virgin America onboards new users  Credits  UserOnboard  Conclusion  Your user onboarding experience can make or break your business  Before designing your onboarding  stop and think about what the experience of the first time users should be  It s best to think about the first time experience in terms of helping users improve their lives   the emphasis shouldn t be on getting new users to click tap around and familiarize themselves with the interface  but on helping them achieve their goals using your app   Thank you   Follow UX Planet

1321,training-dataset/business/1437.txt,business,What You Must Know To Build Savvy Push NotificationsSmartphones have been around for nearly a decade and yet founders still declare mobile the most underhyped technology  according to First Round s State of Startups Survey  And  within mobile  the potential of push notifications reigns supreme  Entrepreneur Ariel Seidman captures this well   It s hard to over hype the power of mobile push notifications  For the first time in human history  you can tap almost two billion people on the shoulder   That s why Slack s Noah Weiss is a true believer in a world coming closer together through smarter pings   Before Slack  Weiss worked at Foursquare when it monetized the service with native ads and boldly split into two apps in 2014  During that time  monthly active users more than quintupled  Weiss was also Google s lead product manager on structured data related search projects  Recently  Weiss joined Slack to build out its New York office and lead its new Search  Learning and Intelligence Group with a mandate to develop features that make companies more productive the more they use Slack   In this interview  Weiss maps out the dynamic evolution of push notifications   revealing critical paradigm shifts in the era of smartwatches and app filled homescreens  Here  he also shares tips for startups seeking to build out their push notification strategy and the inputs  metrics and guidelines to instate  Any startup that wants to command this high risk  high reward channel will benefit from Weiss  wisdom   A great push notification is three things  timely  personal and actionable   Evolution of Push Notifications  Before sharing tactics  Weiss summarizes the evolution of push notifications as it relates to the three qualities that make pings powerful  being timely  personal and actionable  He sees their history and progression as fundamental context to consider as you build your future strategy  Here s an abridged four stage history   Email As the Push Notification Predecessor  The push notification of the early web era was email   There are a lot of similar analogs between email and push   says Weiss   Back in the day  you gave permission for an open line of communication with a website by giving your email address  Email became the primary  reliable way to bring a person back to a website  it wasn t through a portal or bookmarks  Lastly  there s an unsubscribe option in email  The equivalent for notifications is adjusting the push settings or  more frequently  uninstalling the app    Migration to Mobile  Email started to falter as users engaged more on their mobile phones   It may be hard to recall a time before smartphones  but people didn t used to live in their inboxes  They checked email a few times a day from a computer   says Weiss   Even companies with very successful email marketing strategies hit walls with mobile  Remember Groupon offers of laser hair removal deals  Why did you receive it when you did  When did you show interest in hair removal or indicate you d make this type of purchase decision on your phone  When tied to a user  location and time of day  push notifications became more effective  While they feel abrasive if done poorly  they had the potential to be timely  personal and actionable    Competing with SMS  not Email  On mobile  push notifications are more akin to texts than emails   Push is about what is relevant to this moment  You can send an email that you may not expect to be read for a couple of days  that s okay for newsletters or digests   says Weiss   However  the timeliness or the attention required in real time with a push notification is completely different  With pings  you re effectively competing with SMS and other very personal forms of communication  How personal do you have to be if the rest of the notifications come from someone s spouse  best friend or mom  It has to be at that same level    Cutting through all the apps  When people first adopted smartphones  their apps could fit in a 4x4 grid on their home screen  Now  the average person in the U S  has around 55 apps on their phone   You get to the point where there s no way one can actually use all those apps on a regular basis  It s so hard today to develop a cadence where an app becomes a daily habit   says Weiss   The reality for developers is you re probably not going to be on someone s home screen and users likely aren t going to be in the habit of using it multiple times a day  That s where notifications become increasingly important  For most apps  a push notification can be perfect for delivering urgent information  an Uber is arriving  your flight s gate has changed or you re mentioned in Slack  If users are inundated with 50  apps  you can t rely on them to remember to use you at the right time and place  You need to proactively pull them in    Noah Weiss  Build Your Notification Strategy Around These Tenets  An in depth notification strategy can weigh and weave together several factors  such as nearby wifi  personalization  social factors and real time snapping to places to power its push notifications  But for startups that are just embarking on their push notification technology  there are fundamentals to consider  From the basics to more advanced tips  Weiss outlines the essential lessons he s learned while developing push notification systems   Boost retention outside the app   From a user retention standpoint  there are diminishing returns after your app crosses a threshold of functionality  There s only so many features you can jam into a single app and expect new users to discover them in their first few sessions   The biggest challenge in mobile is retaining new users  There are proven tactics to get them through the door  efficient app install marketing  social channels  SEM and SEO  However  what s really hard is getting new users to develop a habit   says Weiss   There comes a time when improvements to your app won t dramatically affect top line retention anywhere close to an investment in the surface area outside of your app  namely push notifications  That s because once someone closes your app  it doesn t matter if there s a magical experience they missed on the fourth tab of the app  If they never open it up again  they ll never know what they missed out on    In your quest to build the best user experience for your app  don t forget that that experience only happens if users open the app in the first place   and keep returning to it   It always amazes   and pains   me when I see the incredible time and effort put into an app with no hint of a strategy to re engage me   says Weiss   Of course most young developers aren t thinking about notifications  Don t make that mistake  It s the single biggest oversight in mobile product development today    Customer acquisition propels an app  User retention builds a business   Don t mistake a download with permission   Asking for the authority to send notifications is not only good form  but technologically necessary   If you re building on iOS  sending notifications is a permission the user must authorize  Unlike on Android  downloading the app does not give you that authority  You have to prompt users for it   says Weiss   This is the pivotal moment  If users decline permission  there s no way for the app to reach out to pull them back in  which drastically decreases the likelihood that they ll be active users down the line  Even if they accept  it is not a binding contract    If users get tired of your push notifications  the best case is that they select which notifications to keep active in app  but it s more likely that they ll navigate to their phone settings to turn off all notifications or simply uninstall the app  This is effectively irreversible  The takeaway  Deliver on users  first notification experiences or they ll shut down the channel for good    So the first step is to prompt users to agree to notifications at the start   if they say no  the rest of this advice doesn t matter  It involves user education  placing prompts after actions users find valuable or doing pre prompts to get the green light to ask permission at later dates to increase the rate of conversion  Then it s about maintaining trust and keeping an open line of communication  There s strong literature that s been written on both steps  so Weiss recommends this syllabus   Given the high stakes of getting permission to notify  the thrust of these articles is to default to being risk averse   If you re smart  you re actually very cautious when it comes to notifications  Build safety nets into all experiments  because any misfire can burn for a long time   says Weiss   For example  if I were to launch a weekly ping that all users would receive  I d start it as a 5 or 10 percent experiment to cap any potential downside of people opting out of notifications    Nail down three metrics to measure notifications     To assess your notification strategy  nail down three metrics  1  the rate of users opting out of your notification permissions  2  the uninstall rate and 3  actions per hundred pings    To evaluate a great notification  you have to balance positive engagement with the downside of setting opt outs  It s a tricky balance  because you may be comparing a short term engagement boost versus a longer term downside of users who ve uninstalled and can no longer be re engaged   says Weiss   Start by pinning your assessment to uninstall and notification disable rates  If you re a consumer app and your uninstall rate is below 2  you re in a safe zone  So if your weekly churn is 1  and you have a 2  rate increase to 1 02   that s not devastating  Monitor any drastic fluctuation though  as a compounding effect week on week can become damaging    To capture the reward of the notification strategy  look beyond open rates to measure specific actions taken   One tack that I recommend is to monitor a window of time post ping for the number of actions that can be tied back to the original notification  For example  if the notification encouraged users to rate places they ve visited recently  analyze how many ratings users made per hundred pings within a 2 6 hour window   says Weiss   There are always questions of attribution  but if you define a fixed window of time to evaluate after a notification is shipped  you can accept the results with a higher degree of confidence       but calibrate them to compare performance on iOS and Android   For those that want to track open rates as a metric  Weiss has a few observations about the nature of notifications on different operating systems   It s as easy to track open rates from pings as it is with email  but know that iOS open rates are much  much lower than Android  they can show up to five times more open rates for identical pings on iOS   says Weiss   Users tend to process the notifications on Android  as there s an inbox that only clears as you manually open each ping  whereas on iOS  once you open up one notification from your lock screen  the others all clear    As with other functionalities  operating systems have different capabilities when it comes notifications   For example  notifications on Android can display inline photos  which can get a free 15 20  boost of engagement  Since most developers are most often working in iOS  they don t think to send Android push notifications with photos   says Weiss   There s also inline action buttons so users can take steps from notifications  Those also get higher engagement rates  Basically everything about Android is better for notification development  and I say that as an iPhone user    Fill your notifications with personalized tidbits  so they sound like they came from a close friend   Counteract the novelty effect   Run experiments with notifications for a minimum of six weeks but 12 weeks is a good sweet spot  Weiss has learned that conducting tests for a longer period of time is necessary to surface any negative effects   The average user will ignore unwanted pings for about a month without taking action  such as altering settings or uninstalling the app  There s a threshold that s passed where annoyance surprasses the ease of quick dismissal   says Weiss   Notifications have strong novelty biases  which delay the true impact on users  Once Weiss launched an experiment to test emoji heavy pings to users   We cut down the length of text by half and added relevant emoji  In the first couple weeks of the experiment  our metrics shot through the roof  Users and ping opens were up significantly  WAUs  weekly active users  were up  It was tempting to announce that the future was here and it was emojis   says Weiss   Well  we monitored it over time and the growth slowed and then flatlined  In the end  the impact was neutral  That s not bad  but it would have been if we allocated resources based off of initial results  It s best to test in months rather than weeks with notifications    Experiment with how  when and where   The  why  and  who  behind push notifications is often more straightforward   the goal is to increase engagement among all users  However  there s a diversity of thought on the way in which pings should be released  Through his career  Weiss has helped launch over 100 notification experiments   testing everything from time of day to triggering based on arriving back at home  As with shipping software  there s no  right  way  but here he shares some non negotiables   Resort to vibration for only the most urgent of pings    With push  you can control the default of whether the phone vibrates or is silent  From all my user research  I ve learned this is one of the most high risk decisions  If a notification vibrates a user and she doesn t find it urgent  the likelihood of the app being uninstalled immediately skyrockets   says Weiss   If it s urgent   like you are about to miss your plane or an urgent  direct message from a coworker   a buzz can be a very powerful and appreciated tool  If not  it s dangerous and will backfire  so don t use it for events like favorites or likes from a friend  On average  people check their phone between 70 to 100 times a day  so they re likely see your message anyway within the next 15 minutes    Match users  biorhythms    The timing of your ping matters  but there s not one rule declaring the absolute best window  But take a moment to think about how to mirror the progression of your users  days  Avoid sending notification when your user is asleep because you ll wake them or they ll find a queue of messages on top of yours in the morning   says Weiss   Consider the nature of your content  too  Sending news in the morning works well  as does sending content as they commute to or from work  Refine your cadence by monitoring their engagement    Use variety of personalization in your copy    It makes a huge difference  Inserting the user s first name doesn t count  like  Noah  here are your daily deals for Tuesday   Showcase what you know about your users in the ping copy   otherwise they ll activate their natural filter against marketing blasts   says Weiss   Twitter has a good practice for users catching up on their timeline  The service prompts you to check out tweets from the last day from Evelyn  Marcos and Lydia  These are all people you follow  called out by name  Spotify does the same with new songs from artists you listen to frequently    Think of your ping as an Uber   Would you be happy if your Uber dropped you off on any block in Manhattan if you requested a specific one in the Lower East Side  Well  it seems obvious  but may startups forget to route their users to the screen in the app exactly where the ping promised   says Weiss   People will click on the notifications if it gets them to where they were expecting  If not  they ll ignore it the next time  A lot of e commerce apps screw this up by sending customers to the generic home screen  rather than a specific item or page    Magicians bring your card to the top of a deck  Apps with smart notifications will have this sleight of hand  lifting their service to the front of people s phones at the right time   The Future of Notifications  Smartphone and smartwatch screens will keep changing  but the real estate of home screens will always be finite regardless of the size  Given the ballooning number of apps kept on phones  this limitation is a constraint  Here is how he sees mobile operating systems evolving and food for thought on the future of notifications   Make the lockscreen the new home screen  The truth is that the only place people see more than their phone s home screen is their lockscreen   Your home screen houses the apps you want at your fingertips  limited to less than 20  Your lockscreen lists your recent notifications from the hundreds of apps you have on your phone   says Weiss   I think that the lock screen is going to wind up replacing the home screen  There ll be one home experience  which will have a stream of apps reaching out to you  Eventually ranking will matter more than just recency and frequency  The OS notifications will evolve from feeling like Twitter s real time  noisy stream to feeling like Facebook s ranked feed    You ll always be able to navigate to an app  but notifications will be your steadfast sherpa   There s a natural phenomenon with the bundling and unbundling of apps  and Weiss sees a tide shift where the lockscreen will rebundle them once more   Over the last three years  there s been a gradual  giant unbundling in the app ecosystem  Apps have become more specialized for single purpose use cases   says Weiss   But as users amass dozens and dozens of apps  it s increasingly hard to navigate to the right service at the right time  Notifications are apps signaling to people they have something timely and useful to offer  There will be a new navigation paradigm  where apps control   hopefully intelligently   when users are thinking about using them    Enrich contextual awareness  If users increasingly interact with apps through a stream of pings sent to a lockscreen  it ll be because they inherently trust that they re being sent the most timely  relevant alerts  That only happens with a robust contextual awareness   The sensors on your phone allow you to build a level of contextual awareness into your mobile services that you could never do on desktop or email  How do you take that awareness and translate it into really actionable timely relevant notifications   asks Weiss   That s kind of the exciting new frontier  Imagine a service that can distinguish if someone stops at a specific business  whether it s a caf  or an airport or a gym  The unique understanding of context creates a ton of new opportunities for sending relevant pings    The best apps will be the ones you don t have to remember to use  They ll remind you  Soon that ll be the only type of app    One of my favorite push notifications from Foursquare is for new and trending venues in a city  It can crosslist that with the places you ve actually visited just based on where your phone has been   says Weiss   It ll send you a notification usually once a week which is  Hey  here are three places that are hot and trending in your city that you haven t tried yet   It s this magical moment when you realize you ve just been walking around with the phone in your pocket  maybe you haven t even used the app all week  You haven t had to do a single bit of work  It not only pulls you back into the app  but it also delights you    A comprehensive approach to leveraging sensors on mobile can be challenging  but there are basic ways to get started   While most developers cannot easily build this type of location understanding  it s fairly trivial to build a model for understanding when a person is at home or work based on background location  Those are two very rich contexts for triggering relevant pings   says Weiss   Bringing it All Together  While notifications are great for boosting retention and engagement rates  don t start off by looking at them as a growth hacking tool  They have the potential to be the most intuitive and intimate way to interact with your users  In order to build that trustworthy relationship  they must be timely  personal and actionable  A notification strategy must ask permission from users and be measured by their opt outs  uninstalls and actions per 100 pings  The more that notifications can be customized actively via user input and passively through contextual awareness  the better    We are still in early days with mobile  Devices continue to shapeshift to have bigger screens  longer battery life or become wearable   says Weiss   Yet no matter how the hardware develops  notifications will be the most intimate feature of your mobile device  Like a close friend or family member  smart notifications remember your preferences and history  They ll guide you the right direction  keep you connected with loved ones and remind you of what s important at the best time  That s about as powerful as technology gets    Photographs courtesy of Slack,"[1321 623 647 127 810 840 1318 882 1166 252 285]"
1346,training-dataset/product/119.txt,product,Building apps for kids  The definitive guideI remember Mark Zuckerberg once saying  I definitely wouldn t have gotten into programming if I hadn t played games as a kid    This correlation isn t a surprise  although it did spark a revelation when I was researching the most popular children s apps for this post  The same apps kept appearing again and again  At that moment  I realized that creating a phenomenal kids  app has an incredible but often underestimated power to mold the future   Through their apps  these designers and developers have a huge influence over future generations  Indirectly  their apps are responsible for creating our next Mark Zuckerbergs   Related  These 5 major UI mistakes will kill your app  It s fair to argue that these select apps have a larger collective impact on the future than massively successful  well established companies we look up to  which is why designing a children s app isn t easy  In fact  it s really quite difficult   If you think you re up for the challenge  keep reading  In this post  you ll learn   The differences between designing for kids and adults  The similarities between designing for kids and adults  A framework for designing for kids  Tips for designing for kids  Designing for kids versus designing for adults  4 key differences  The main difference between designing for kids and designing for adults comes down to the goal s  of the users   According to Debra Gelman  author of Designing for Kids  Digital Products for Playing and Learning  when you re designing for adults even when designing games for adults the goal is to help them cross the finish line  But when you re designing for children  the finish line is just a small part of the story   Here are 4 key differences to examine   1  Kids love a good challenge or conflict  Think about it  An adult  using a banking or email app  just wants to accomplish their task as quickly and easily as possible  Whereas a child  playing a game  enjoys challenges and conflicts along the way because it makes their accomplishment more significant in the end   A prime example is Toca House  a popular iPad app by the makers at Toca Boca  which challenges children to vacuum a dirty rug  Of course  the rug isn t clean after just one swipe because that wouldn t be hard enough   Gelman says that micro conflicts like vacuuming a dirty rug help children resolve their own inner conflicts  She bolsters her case with a LEGO study on conflict play  which states that micro conflicts help kids develop skills like   Predicting how others are likely to react to their behavior  Controlling their own emotions  Communicating clearly  Seeing other people s points of view  Creatively resolving disagreements  2  Kids want feedback on everything  When playing in a digital space  kids expect visual and auditory feedback whenever they do something   This is why most children s apps generate some sort of reaction or response for every interaction  Kids expect to be rewarded for whatever they do   3  Kids are more trusting than adults  Because children can t predict or understand the consequences of their actions ahead of time  they re typically much more trusting than adults  This means that you  as the designer  are responsible for knowing this and building safeguards into your app   4  Kids develop faster than adults  If you visit the App Store  you ll notice that the kids  category can be filtered by age ranges  Ages 5 and under    Ages 6 to 8   and  Ages 9 to 11  among them  This is because kids develop much faster than adults  meaning an app for a 4 year old won t also be a fit for a 6 year old   A good rule of thumb  Focus on a 2 year age range  max  Just think about the differences between a 4  and 8 year old  While one age group may dive in and learn the app as they go  another may need clear instructions to boost their confidence in using the app   Designing for kids versus designing for adults  4 key similarities  You don t have to relearn everything you know about good design to make a children s app  There s still quite a few similarities between designing for kids and designing for adults   Here are the 4 key similarities of designing for kids and designing for adults   1  Users expect consistency  Children and adults both expect design patterns to be consistent  Contrary to popular belief  kids don t like it when everything on their screen does something  cool    According to Gelman  both kids and adults get annoyed by design elements that seem random and unnecessary  Children like items on a screen to do cool stuff as long as there s a method to the proverbial madness   Related  Mobile UX and user expectations   Elements that get in the way or animate spontaneously or don t contribute to the overall goal can frustrate kids and adults alike  and cause them to abandon a game or an app entirely   Gelman says   In addition  if everything on the screen moves  is brightly colored  or makes noise on the same level  kids and adults become confused about what is interactive and what isn t  and this makes it very hard for them to use the site or app  A common design principle for adults is to keep interactions and feedback consistent so that users will be able to learn how use the site or app quickly  The same is true for kids    2  Users need a reason to use your app  Your app must have a purpose  and its purpose must be obvious from the start  for both adults and children   While it s easy to believe children will just love exploring your app  they ll quickly become bored if it doesn t give them a reason to use it   Whether designing for kids or adults  always clearly articulate what your app does and how it works before users have the opportunity to become bored with it   3  Users don t want to be surprised  Users will envision your app working a certain way  and they expect it to work that way  They don t want to be surprised when it behaves another way than they expected   For example  when you re purchasing something online  after you pay  you expect an email receipt and a message that confirms your purchase  Adults don t want to be re routed to a landing page  where you try to upsell them on another offering   The same is true for kids  Gelman says  and she provides the following example    As a kid adding gems to a box in a game  you expect to be able to open the box where the gems are stored to see them all  not to have to open the box  pull out drawers  and hunt for the stuff you thought was in there   she says   4  Users want a little something extra  Gelman calls this a lagniappe   A lagniappe is a little something extra an Easter egg thrown in to delight users or customers  and both adults and kids enjoy these small  unexpected interactions that enhance their experience with a site or app   Related  3 ways to design happiness  Lagniappes are different from surprises  which as I mentioned above  users don t enjoy   A surprise is when someone comes up from behind you  when you re deep in work and scares the crap out of you  A lagniappe is the first class upgrade you got for free  when you were squished in a middle seat  between 2 crying babies and their mothers   For example  Snapchat s  pull down to refresh  feature shows a dancing ghost that changes colors  letting users know their feed is updating   You can always steal some ideas from Toca Boca  too   Keep these differences and similarities in mind when you re designing apps for kids   A framework for designing for kids  Designing a good children s app is more than just dumbing down adult concepts  Like designing for adults  you must understand your users and where they are cognitively  physically  and emotionally so your app resonates   Simultaneously  you don t want to stray too far away from common design principles either  which is why it s helpful to also understand the similarities of designing for kids and designing for adults   Some of these steps will probably look familiar   Drop your sketchbook  and pick up your notebook  One of the reasons designing a phenomenal kids  app is so difficult is because designers aren t children  This is an issue because  as we all know  designers must have empathy with users   But before you decide to go watch some random kids to figure out how they interact with each other  and what holds their attention and what doesn t  choose an age range 2 years max to focus on   Once you pick an age range  it s time to observe and take notes   Let s be real  Kids can be difficult to understand  especially for those of us who aren t around them a lot  This is why you have to observe them to actually understand them   Also  today s children are digital natives  They ve grown up with technology  so even if you can somehow remember what being a kid is like  you can t possibly fully relate to today s youth   Try observing different groups of children in the same age range  such as children who know each other  all girls  all boys  indoors and outdoors   According to UX Matters  children communicate volumes simply by how they play  what they choose to play with  how long they choose to play with it  and when they decide to play with something else   How do they play  communicate  and interact with things in their environments   Surprisingly  any silly thing a child does could potentially tell you how they ll use your app   Here s a few things you could ask yourself   Do kids in this age range enjoy sticking to the rules  or do they prefer inventing their own games   Are they trying very hard  or are they just trying to out silly each other   Are there differences between the ways boys and girls approach play   Now it s time to take things up a notch and choose a specific type of play to narrow in on that relates to your app   Toca Tea Party  the popular iPad app by Toca Boca  is a prime example here   It began as a paper prototype  with cutouts of teapots  cups  and saucers  sitting on top of an iPad  The creators set out the elements and let kids play with it    Originally the idea was to make the food  but the kids just wanted to get past that part   says Jeffery   Now we have pre made cakes but you get to set the table  One of the most appreciated features was spilling  That came from the kids   Ooooh  he spilled     Consider participatory design  Participatory design  also called co design  is a phenomenal method for understanding children  It involves gathering groups of children together  giving them craft supplies  and having them come up with their own design ideas for your product   This helps you not because the kids  designs will be good  but because you ll understand how they view different subjects  For example  if a girl creates a fairy to help her with her homework  what type of personality does it have  Is she mischievous like Tinkerbell or caring like The Fairy Godmother in Cinderella   You could also give children workbooks  or have them create collages or storyboards for you as well   Test it out  Now it s time to test out your app with a prototyping tool that will allow you to test complex tasks  such as swiping and zooming   These gestures are important because younger children haven t developed their motor skills  like adults have  therefore  they can t use their hands the same way adults can  In fact  one designer recommends staying away from these types of gestures and sticking to the classic arrow buttons   Once you create your prototype  give it to a child and ask them to teach you how to use your app  or watch them teach another child how to use it   Tips for designing for kids  As you ve learned  designing for kids is a pretty different ballgame than designing for adults  They love bright colors  and they want feedback on everything they do   To take our research a step further  we spoke with a variety of experts on the topic  Keep reading to get their best tips and tricks for designing for kids   Let kids make mistakes  Word Wizard is an app that teaches kids how to spell with a moveable alphabet that embraces mistakes beautifully   In a sandbox type of environment  kids can put letters in any order they like  then the app reads the  word  aloud  allowing children to understand how the letters sound together   For example  a child might put together a 100 character  word  or rather a fascinating amalgamation of seemingly nonsensical sounds  Users can even change the audio feedback speed  accent  and tone  which adds to the playfulness and immersive power of the experience   There s no abrasive buzzer  alerting kids that they created a word that isn t in the dictionary  And you won t find a giant  red  x  icon placed beside the imaginative juxtaposition either   The child will understand that they made a mistake on their own by listening to the result    Mistakes are okay  It s okay to make mistakes   Abel said   Mistakes are a natural part of learning  Integrate the mistake into the learning    When asked what advice he d offer designers interested in building children s apps  Abel says it s vital that education apps are built on facts  otherwise they re useless    There are a lot of apps out there where the person didn t do their homework  You can easily get a book on a new topic  and learn everything you need to know before you start developing the app  If I ever have a doubt  I ask experts  and they explain everything to me    Give children endless possibilities  Josh Sheldon  Director of Programs at MIT App Inventor  says the best children s apps give kids the freedom to explore and delve into an immersive experience    Make sure it isn t entirely scripted   he recommended   Give kids the ability to take their own path or journey through a new experience    Design for children first  Designers miss the mark when they try to impose an adult perspective    This can vary from having interactions that seem  normal  from an adult point of view  such as tapping an object to select it and then tapping again to use it which is not something that kids can relate to  Kids tend to pick up an object  and make their action straight away  it s not a two step process for them   Victor Guerrero  programmer at Toca Boca  said   Guerrero cites Vectorpark as a good example     Vectorpark  is very good at interactivity and physicality of interactions so playing around with objects in his creations feels super nice  Another great aspect of their work is that the concepts are always surprising which pokes kids   and adults   imagination too    It s important to note that kids are more imaginative and physical than adults    Try to surprise them  and make systems that give them freedom so they can explore  and be creative within your app   Guerrero said   But keep in adults in mind  Abel reminds designers that the app must please parents as well as children because it s not the kids who are buying the app  This makes things difficult   To circumvent this obstacle  Hopscotch  an app that teaches people how to code  gather as much feedback as possible from a wide variety of people in different contexts    We re next to Grand Central so we wait for kids to come in with their parents at the Apple store  and ask them to try the app   Hopscotch s Head of Community and Partnerships Liza Conrad  said   Conrad highly recommends getting as much feedback as possible from kids  teachers  and parents  in a variety of different contexts  By actively seeking diverse groups of people  your app will be less likely to have biases   Think beyond reality  According to Guerrero  limiting for the sake of limiting could be a bad option  such as making some clothes items available to only certain characters or not being able to do things just because you can t do it in reality    One feature in Toca Boca apps that kids love is being able to stack many items on top of each other  such as hats or scoops of ice cream  It s hard to do that in real life but kids don t care about that  they just want to play and have fun   he said   Challenging the norms can often give an interesting perspective on play  and usually challenging norms is fun too    Kids love hard fun  A first grader inspired the late mathematician  computer scientist  and educator Seymour Papert to find the term that had been eluding him   hard fun     The Gardner Academy was one of the first schools to own enough computers for students to spend significant time with them every day  Their introduction  for all grades  was learning to program  in the computer language Logo  at an appropriate level   Papert wrote   A teacher heard one child using these words to describe the computer work   It s fun  It s hard  It s Logo   I have no doubt that this kid called the work fun because it was hard rather than in spite of being hard    Hard fun boils down to the belief that everyone enjoys themselves when they re working on something challenging   Combine learning and fun  and you ll have an app kids can t help but stick to    Did you ever hear about a game advertised as being easy  What is worst about school curriculum is the fragmentation of knowledge into little pieces  This is supposed to make learning easy  but often ends up depriving knowledge of personal meaning and making it boring  Ask a few kids  the reason most don t like school is not that the work is too hard  but that it is utterly boring    And Papert wouldn t recommend that you take a play from curriculum designers  playbooks  but instead look to game designers and developers for guidance    Game designers have a better take on the nature of learning than curriculum designers  Their livelihoods depend on millions of people being prepared to undertake the serious amount of learning needed to master a complex game  If their public failed to learn they would go out of business  In the case of curriculum designers  the situation is reversed  their business is boosted whenever students fail to learn and schools clamor for a new curriculum  I believe that this explains why I have learned very little about learning from reading textbooks on curriculum design  and have learned a great deal from both the users  mostly kids  and the designers  often  grown up kids   of computer games    Don t trick kids into buying stuff  Abel recommends keeping ads out of children s apps because kids just aren t prepared to handle it   Clean up the bottom of your screens  Kids incessantly touch the bottom of tablets by mistake  therefore  putting any interactive elements there will most likely irritate users  when they keep accidentally hitting stuff they don t mean to hit   And don t forget to use bright colors  This one s pretty self explanatory  but nonetheless important   The children are our future  Design an app that helps them lead the way   Today s youngest app users  the freshly minted Generation Alpha  born post 2010  have unprecedented exposure to digital technology  Recent studies have found that in the US  75  of children younger than 8 have access to a smartphone or tablet  as do 36  of kids under the age of one   While this means designing children s apps can reap you massive monetary rewards  it also and arguably most importantly means app creators have the potential to influence an entire generation   I mean  can you imagine if you were responsible for creating the game that got Mark Zuckerberg into programming  I m sure it must feel nothing short of exhilarating   This post was originally published on

bandwidth has improved  video has become a larger part of the app experience  The time people spent watching video in the last half increased by more than 40   and yesterday  we announced longer video to give creators more flexibility and open up new ways to connect with the community  In this post  we ll share some of the things we ve done to improve video playback on Android and maintain user experience while increasing video length 4x   Instagram introduced 15 second video in 2013  One of our core engineering values is  Do the Simple Thing First   so we implemented a basic video playback mechanism on Android  When a video appears in feed  the app first downloads the whole video file to the phone storage  After the download is complete  the file is passed to the Android built in MediaPlayer to play the video   This design worked well when the maximum video length was only 15 seconds  However  we recently decided to increase the maximum video length to 60 seconds  We recognized this would stress our current design for a few reasons   Video cannot play until the whole file is downloaded  As the video becomes larger  playback would wait even longer for the video to download  People on slower network connections might need to wait for a very long time before they can play the first second of the video  Video won t play if there s a disk space issue  If there is not enough space in the disk to store the whole video file in the disk cache or if there s some failure in the I O  the video will never play   With those issues in mind  we decided to build a new video cache that could stream the video to the MediaPlayer as the video file is being downloaded  This would remove the bottleneck of waiting for the download to finish   We started to look into how to build a streaming video cache that worked with our current video player  We found that the Android MediaPlayer only supports playing a video from either a file or a URL  We wouldn t have the complete video file to give to the MediaPlayer when we are still downloading  so this leaves us with playing the video from a URL  The naive approach of passing our CDN URL to the MediaPlayer would mean that we wouldn t have any control over the bytes downloaded  so we would not be able to cache the video in case a person wanted to watch it again  Knowing this fact  we decided to have the MediaPlayer interact with a local proxy server instead  and have the proxy server serve the byte stream to the media player while also storing it into the disk cache   It turns out that this new design solves many of the problems in the previous design with some extra benefits   Playback is no longer blocked by the video download  i e  it plays as soon as there s enough content  Playback is no longer dependent on disk space  Even if the disk cache malfunctions  it would just be treated as a cache miss and streamed directly from the server  Allows more prefetching adjustments  This new mechanism allows us to explore more options in regard to prefetching video files depending on the network condition  as the prefetched content can now be directly streamed while we download the rest of the file on background   We tested our new implementation extensively across many devices and Android versions  Our testing surfaced an issue  Some Android Lollipop devices made multiple  up to 3  download requests before playing the video   they would request the beginning of the file  then make a HTTP range request for the end of the file  then request the beginning again  To figure this out  we need to understand a little about the mp4 file format  An mp4 is a container for one or more video and audio tracks  and it contains metadata that specifies where each of these tracks start  We had already reconfigured our video encoding to place this metadata at the start of the file  instead of the end  the default   to avoid the inefficient behavior of making multiple requests to play the video  We hypothesized that the MediaPlayer was not playing nice with our video encoding   Upon deeper investigation  we managed to scope the problem down to devices that use NuPlayer  which is the default implementation of MediaPlayer starting in Lollipop  replacing the older AwesomePlayer   Looking deeper into the MPEG4Extractor and NuCachedSource2 code  we deduced that NuPlayer was not handling one of the MP4 container atoms  specifically  the FREE atom  correctly and was getting confused  Removing FREE atoms solved the problem  and we modified our video transcoding tier to include this cleanup logic before we launched the new video playback  We were pretty satisfied with the result of the new implementation   Below are some of the  statistically significant  results we gathered after performing a limited A B test of streaming vs  non streaming playback with 15 second videos in the wild   The table above shows three metrics  percentage of videos played within 1 second of scrolling on screen  the average start delay to the first frame of the video  and the 95th percentile of the start delay distribution  We initially started by gathering data on the number of videos played within 1 second and the average start delay for all videos  We noticed that the new streaming cache performed worse for the number of videos that played within 1 second  0 8  fewer videos   but better for average time to play  18  lower  Since these results contradicted each other  we dug in to analyze the data further   We sliced the data to exclude videos that started playing within 200ms  The majority of the videos that play within 200ms are probably cached fully on disk  which shouldn t be affected by our new implementation  We hypothesized that removing the data  noise  from these cached videos would help us get a more accurate measurement of the impact of the streaming player  and help us to understand the discrepancy in performance between less than 1 second video play time vs  the average  Removing the lower end of the distribution gave us a more accurate view of the impact of the streaming player  the average and p95 time to play are faster by 22 28   However  this still didn t explain why the number of videos that played within 1 second was actually lower with streaming enabled  We dug in deeper still and plotted the time to play distribution of the videos   This plot shows the percentage of videos  y axis  that are played within a certain number of seconds  x axis   Looking at the distribution  we see that the streaming cache  black bars  improved the start time in general  but it seemed to regress the start time for videos that had formerly fallen into the 0 1 second bucket  To try to explain this result  we circled back to check the implementation of MediaPlayer  We discovered that using the setUrl API incurs an artificial 1 second start delay on some older versions of Android MediaPlayer  to give the streaming buffer extra time to fill   This matches the data plot above and explains the result we gathered  In general  the streaming cache has shifted the distribution to the left  you can see the long tail of only blue bars   but pushes some of the leftmost distribution slightly to the right  The impact of this artificial delay is minimal  because we wrote code to shortcut the proxy server and play the file directly if it is fully cached  the setFile API does not have a delay    We did the simple thing first when we first launched video on Instagram  and shipped a stable and robust video viewing experience to our users in a timely manner  But doing the simple thing first does not mean that we sacrifice quality or performance  On the contrary  we focus on what matters most at the time and continuously reevaluate what we have to make sure that the whole app experience is top notch  Video playback is one recent example where changing product requirements led us to rethink our initial assumptions  It also showcases the importance of collecting and analyzing data to verify that performance improvements are actually working as expected  We hope that by providing a better video playback experience we will enable more people to enjoy the moments that they have captured and shared on Instagram,"[467 1210 1358 351 885 162 571 947 926 1256 1059]"
1367,training-dataset/business/488.txt,business,THE SHIFT IN BUSINESS MODELS FROM PIPES TO PLATFORMSWhy do most social networks never take off   Why are marketplaces such difficult businesses   Why do startups with the best technology fail so often   There are two broad business models  pipes and platforms  You could be running your startup the wrong way if you re building a platform  but using pipe strategies   More on that soon  but first a few definitions   Pipes  Pipes have been around us for as long as we ve had industry  They ve been the dominant model of business  Firms create stuff  push them out and sell them to customers  Value is produced upstream and consumed downstream  There is a linear flow  much like water flowing through a pipe 3  We see pipes everywhere  Every consumer good that we use essentially comes to us via a pipe  All of manufacturing runs on a pipe model  Television and Radio are pipes spewing out content at us  Our education system is a pipe where teachers push out their  knowledge  to children  Prior to the internet  much of the services industry ran on the pipe model as well   This model was brought over to the internet as well  Blogs run on a pipe model  An ecommerce store like Zappos works as a pipe as well  Single user SAAS runs on pipe model where the software is created by the business and delivered on a pay as you use model to the consumer   Platforms  Had the internet not come up  we would never have seen the emergence of platform business models  Unlike pipes  platforms do not just create and push stuff out  They allow users to create and consume value 9 At the technology layer  external developers can extend platform functionality using APIs  At the business layer  users  producers  can create value on the platform for other users  consumers  to consume  This is a massive shift from any form of business we have ever known in our industrial hangover   TV Channels work on a Pipe model but YouTube works on a Platform model  Encyclopaedia Britannica worked on a Pipe model but Wikipedia has flipped it and built value on a Platform model  Our classrooms still work on a Pipe model but Udemy and Skillshare are turning on the Platform model for education   Business Model Failure  So why is the distinction important   Platforms are a fundamentally different business model  If you go about building a platform the way you would build a pipe  you are probably setting yourself up for failure 3  We ve been building pipes for the last few centuries and we often tend to bring over that execution model to building platforms  The media industry is struggling to come to terms with the fact that the model has shifted  Traditional retail  a pipe  is being disrupted by the rise of marketplaces and in store technology  which work on the platform model   Pipe Thinking vs  Platform Thinking  So how do you avoid this as an entrepreneur   Here s a quick summary of the ways that these two models of building businesses are different from each other   User acquisition  User acquisition is fairly straightforward for pipes  You get users in and convert them to transact  Much like driving footfalls into a retail store and converting them  online stores also focus on getting users in and converting them   Many platforms launch and follow pipe tactics like the above  Getting users in  and trying to convert them to certain actions  However  platforms often have no value when the first few users come in  They suffer from a chicken and egg problem  which I talk extensively about on this blog  Users  as producers  typically produce value for other users  consumers   Producers upload photos on Flickr and product listings on eBay  which consumers consume  Hence  without producers there is no value for consumers and without consumers  there is no value for producers   Platforms have two key challenges   1  Solving the chicken and egg problem to get both producers and consumers on board  2  Ensuring that producers produce  and create value  Without solving for these two challenges  driving site traffic or app downloads will not help with user acquisition   Startups often fail when they are actually building platforms but use Pipe Thinking for user acquisition   Pipe Thinking  Optimize conversion funnels to grow   Platform Thinking  Build network effects before you optimize conversions  Tweet  Product Design and Management  Creating a pipe is very different from creating a platform   Creating a pipe requires us to build with the consumer in mind  An online travel agent like Kayak com is a pipe that allows users to consume airline tickets  All features are built with a view to enable consumers to find and consume airline tickets   In contrast  a platform requires us to build with both producers and consumers in mind  Building YouTube  Dribbble or AirBnB requires us to build tools for producers  e g  video hosting on YouTube  as well as for consumers  e g  video viewing  voting etc    Keeping two separate lenses helps us build out the right features   The use cases for pipes are usually well established  The use cases for platforms  sometimes  emerge through usage  E g  Twitter

advertising campaigns  your goal is to avoid making the rookie mistakes   Once you lose focus and hit the wrong square  you re out       It s a good thing that Facebook advertising doesn t end with a wrong move  It might cost you more advertising dollars  but there s always a way to fix a poorly performing campaign   We ve already covered Facebook ad examples and Facebook ad tips in previous blog post so this article will tackle 29 popular Facebook ads mistakes and will offer the cures to get you closer to your dream campaign results   Here they come  the 29 serious mistakes haunting even the best Facebook ad campaigns     1  Making a Targeting Mistake  No matter how good your Facebook ad copy  design or ad placement  if it s seen by an indifferent audience  there won t be many results   When analyzing the 2016 Q3 Facebook ads statistics  AdEspresso found that there could be over a 1000  difference in the ads  cost per click  depending on the audience you re targeting   For example  the cost per click for some age groups is higher than others       It could be a smart move to start your Facebook ad campaigns with customer research to make sure you are targeting the right audience   Moz   a leading SEO company   was able to make  1 million thanks to the process of interviewing their customers and improving their product accordingly   How to avoid targeting a wrong Facebook audience   1  Do customer research on demographics   Go over your customer base and find out the prevalent audience demographics  age  gender  location  job seniority  purchase behaviors  lifestyle  education  etc  Then  target these demographic groups on Facebook   We ve seen again and again that geographic specificity in ads and on landing pages contribute to better campaign performance  For instance  Engine Ready showed us higher conversion rates happen when local numbers are used instead of toll free 800 numbers       Useto grasp who your target audience is  This tool by Facebook surfaces aggregated information people have already expressed on Facebook  along with information from trusted third party partners   Once you ve learned about your potential audience s interests  it will also be easier to create relevant ad messages and create a winning ad design   3  Target niche interests   Instead of targeting broad interests that describe hundreds of thousands of people  narrow down your target audiences  You can add several layers of interests  so that the audience members must match at least one interest on each targeting level   Facebook recommends niche audience targeting for advertisers aiming to reach a very specific audience  e g  people in a certain location or with specialized interests       2  Low Audience and Offer Match  When creating ad messages  you should consider the fact that not everyone seeing your ad knows about your brand   While some audience members are already familiar with your product and its benefits  there s a good chance that many ad viewers haven t heard of you before  Which might leave them wondering   Why am I seeing this ad    In most PPC campaigns  the target audience can be categorized into three different groups   Ice cubes   people who have never heard of you and haven t visited your site or landing page before  In the Facebook advertising land  ice cubes are usually the people you re targeting with a Saved Audience  Lukewarm audience   people who know who you are  but can t tell for sure what it is that you do  Volcano lava traffic   people who have bought something from you before or are way down the conversion funnel   on the path to becoming a customer     Each of these PPC channel temperature levels needs a dedicated Facebook ad campaign       If your Facebook ad jumps straight to the  Click here and buy now   trail  people might consider it irrelevant or even threatening   For example  this ad by Celebrity Cruises promotes a discount offer without explaining why anyone should want it   This kind of ad would make sense if the ad viewer had purchased from the company before and knew the benefits  However  when seen by a cold audience  this ad would make a lot less sense       A simple way to evaluate your audience match is to check your Facebook ad s Relevance Score   Relevance Score is a calculated metric that helps to understand how your audience is reacting to a particular ad   When analyzing 104 256 Facebook ads  AdEspresso discovered that Facebook campaigns  Relevance Score helps to predict both the cost per click and click through rate       The higher your ad relevancy  the less you ll pay for clicks and conversions   You can see your ads  relevance score when breaking down your Facebook reports by Performance       3  Targeting Audiences That Are Too Broad  We ve seen Facebook ad campaigns targeting over 20 million people in the U S  alone  However  unless you re a household brand  your offer and ad copy might not be relevant to such a broad set of people   The main threat of targeting too broad of an audience is that your offer might not reach the people with highest purchasing potential due to a limited ad budget   Here s an example of a Facebook campaign that reached 234 000 people  However  the total potential audience size for all ad groups was over 1 1 million people  This means that more than 850 000 people didn t see the ad due to budget limits       First  take a look at cold hard numbers   If your audience size reaches millions of people  ask this   Are there truly millions of people potentially interested in buying my product   If the answer is  No   narrow down your audience with demographic or interest based targeting   Facebook s projected ad reach   Another way to tell whether your audience is too broad is to compare Facebook s projected ad reach and the total audience size   For example  if Facebook s campaign setup interface shows that for the budget of  2 000 you can reach 250 000 people out of 2 million  you might want to consider downsizing your audience a bit       4  Not Leveraging Custom Audiences  If you notice your audience is too broad  you can restrict it by excluding people by interests  behaviors and demographics or selecting between custom age ranges and genders   Creating Custom Audiences is one of the best ways to win at Facebook advertising   Remember when we talked about PPC channel temperature and lava hot audiences  By using Facebook Custom Audiences  you ll be able to reach the audience on the warmer side of the scale   SaaS company Scoro ran a Facebook remarketing campaign using Facebook Custom Audiences that resulted in six times more conversions at the same ad budget   If you re not using Facebook Custom Audiences yet  there s a huge Facebook advertising potential waiting to be untapped       Create a remarketing campaign for collecting leads   Target past blog readers and offer them an eBook in exchange for their email address  By asking only for a small commitment of people familiar with your brand  they might be more willing to share their contact details with you  For this purpose  create a Facebook Lead ads campaign to collect contact information in exchange for an eBook or other high value content       People who have visited your landing pages  are interested in a particular product you offer  meaning that you can create landing page specific Facebook ads that match your audience s interests According to  nearly three out of five U S  online buyers say they notice ads for products they ve previously looked up on other sites   Remarket to past purchasers   Set up a Custom Audience of people who have visited your thank you or checkout pages and use this audience for a retargeting campaign for upselling       5  Not Excluding Past Converters  To get a complete overview of all Custom Audience types and smart Facebook remarketing tactics  see our  When starting out with Facebook advertising  people often make the mistake of forgetting to exclude people who have already clicked on the ad and converted   Leaving past converters included in your audience may be a bad idea for several reasons   You re wasting your ad budget on people who have already converted  Your ads are no longer relevant to those already converted  If the person keeps seeing your ads even after making a purchase  they might get annoyed     Forgetting to exclude people can also contribute to higher ad frequency  which means that the same people see your ads over and over again  As a result  you may eventually suffer from ad fatigue and audience decay    Facebook Ad Fatigue   Since the same people see the same ad over multiple days  their engagement with that ad is likely to drop  leading to higher costs for the advertiser   Facebook Audience Decay   When you re targeting the same people over time  their interest in your message usually decreases       To exclude past converters from your Facebook audience  create new Custom Audiences of people who have visited specific web pages  e g  your thank you page    Next  use the EXCLUDE feature when setting up your ad campaign to stop targeting past purchasers or people who have already been to a specific landing page       6  Using the Wrong Ad Type  Facebook allows advertisers to experiment with many different ad types   While Newsfeed Ads are one of the easiest ad types to create  you shouldn t overlook all the other options such as Video Ads and Lead Ads       Just to give you a quick overview of the possibilities  here s a list of Facebook ad types   Newsfeed Ad  Newsfeed ads are usually the first choice of Facebook ad beginners   they re simple to create and set up   Right Column Ad  This is one of the most basic and first types of Facebook ads with a headline  description  and single image  You can see these ads on your Desktop newsfeed   Lead Ads  Facebook Lead Ads give people a quick way to opt into things like eBooks  newsletters  quotes  and offers straight from their mobile devices  You can usually recognize a lead ad by the  Download  call to action button       Also known as Multi Product Ads  this ad type allows to showcase up to ten images and links in a single ad   Dynamic Product Ads   DPA  These remarketing ads target users based on their past actions on your site   Page Like Ads  This Facebook ad type s goal is to get more likes to your brand s Facebook Page   Canvas Ads  Mobile optimized and animated ads that help to tell your brand s story       Event ads help to promote specific events and get more people informed and attending   Mobile App Install Ads  This ad type helps to promote your app and have people install it on mobile   GIF Ads  A few weeks ago  Facebook announced that advertisers can now add GIFs to video ads  Why not give it a try       7  Ads That Fail to Draw Attention  Even if you re targeting a niche Custom Audience and have a brilliant ad message that s relevant to this audience  there s a chance that they won t read your ad copy   Advertising legend David Ogilvy commissioned research into the use of images and discovered that first  people look at the image  Then  they scan the headline   If your ad image and headline fail to catch attention in the Facebook newsfeed  many people will skip over your ad   Ad images that fail to draw attention might be guilty of one of these mistakes   Ad photo resembles amateur photography shared in the newsfeed  Ad doesn t use bright colors  which might reduce its viewability  Ad image contains confusing elements and doesn t match the offer    If you compare these two ads by 17hats and GetResponse   which one gets your attention first       Research has found that people make up their mindsof their initial interactions with either people or products  About 62 90  of their assessment is based on colors alone   Creating more colorful ad images might help to get more people notice your ad  read it  and take your preferred action   If you re still doubting the importance of your Facebook ad image  read this   Consumer Acquisition found that images are incredibly important   they re responsible for 75  90  of ad performance       Make sure that your Facebook ad design is at least 1200 x 628 pixels wide  it s the standard   and that the colors look good on every screen   For more Facebook ad design inspiration see our lineup of 32 awe inspiring Facebook ad examples      8  Too Much Text on the Ad Image  Do you remember the 20  Rule of Facebook ads that implied that only 20  of the ad image may contain text  Otherwise  Facebook could refuse to distribute your ad   Now  the times have changed and Facebook isn t as strict about their text rules anymore   Instead of getting a  Yes  or  No  from Facebook  your ad s text density will fit into one of the four classifications   Ok  Low  Medium  High    You can test your ad s classification by using Facebook s Text Overlay Tool    We ran a test with this ad by Unbounce       Facebook told us that the ad s image concentration is high  explaining   You may not reach your audience  because there s too much text in the ad image  Facebook prefers ad images with little or no text  Unless you qualify for an exception  change your image before placing your order       High text density on your ad images doesn t mean that Facebook won t deliver it  but it will deliver it to fewer audience members   The good thing is that Facebook notifies advertisers by email  guiding their attention to text heavy ads       9  Headlines Without the Right Hook  If you want to be 100  sure that your ad image s text won t mess with your ad results  keep the text density low or use no text on the ad image   According to a study by computer scientists at Columbia University and the French National Institute  59  of people actually never read more than the headline of a Facebook post before sharing or liking it   If you take into account that  on average  we re surrounded by 5 000 ads branded messages per day  it s no big surprise we re grown immune to ads   If your Facebook ad headline fails to catch attention  people might not continue to read the ad copy   This ad example by PPI Check Me has the headline  Ac  Claim   2 750  BBC   that may not be very informative  rather confusing  for the reader       Here s another example by Scoro with a clear and actionable headline explaining the benefit of the product   Emphasize the benefits   Use your ad headline to communicate your product s benefits  By explaining to your audience what s in it for them  they may be more interested in learning about your offer   Keep your ad headlines short and clear   Jeff Bullaz measured the engagement rate of Facebook posts  and discovered that the ultra short 40 character posts received 86  higher engagement than others   Use numbers in headlines   A study by Conductor showed that by starting your headline with a number   you re 36  more likely to have people click on your ads     10  Careless Copywriting  When creating a Facebook campaign  you can write custom copy for every part of your ads   That s a huge responsibility as one wrong line of text could potentially distinguish the spark of interest in a reader       One of the rookie Facebook ad mistakes is not taking the time needed to craft high quality ad copy  To analyze whether your campaigns underperform due poorly written texts or some other missing ad elements  you can set up a split test and experiment with multiple ad copies   For example  DaPulse has experimented with different ad copies while maintaining the initial ad design       How to write good Facebook ad copy   Facebook ad copywriting starts by defining your goal   As Joanna Wiebe from Copy Hackers explained in her article     One of the most important principles to keep in mind when writing your Facebook ad body copy is this  give your body copy a single goal  and stick to it    Think about the goal of your ad campaign  is it to get people buy something from you  to collect new leads or create more brand awareness  Each sentence of your ad copy should support the goal  nudging the reader towards the right action   Facebook recommends to follow three copywriting best practices   Find the right tone of voice  Stick to what s important  Write with the customer in mind    You could also try including testimonials from clients   an article by Econsultancy pointed out that when a website has customer reviews  63  of visitors are more likely to buy something   When writing Facebook ad copy  avoid sounding vague and cryptic as people might not understand your point  Focus on clear  trustworthy  and informative texts     11  Missing a Clear Value Offer  Value offer is like your ad s goal translated into the language of customers   If your ad s goal represents the key action you d like a person to make  the value offer explains why they should take it   UVP   Unique Value Proposition is a clear statement that describes your product s benefit to the customer while differentiating you from your competition   To give you an example of a Facebook ad with a value offer that could be improved  here s one by Freshdesk    While this ad copy is okay  not bad  not perfect   it fails to differentiate the product from competition and explain the final benefit of using the product  How would accessing the helpdesk from my phone help my company in the long term       As Peep Laja fromput it    Value proposition is something real humans are supposed to understand  It s for people to read    Among other things  Peep suggests that   Your value proposition needs to be in the language of the customer   and you cannot guess what that language is  UVPs should be clear and easy to understand  UVP should show it s different or better than the competitor s offer  It should avoid hype  like  never seen before amazing miracle product    It should be easily read and understood in about 5 seconds     If you get these five things right  you re likely to have nailed a stellar value offer   Place your UVP in the headline or on the image of your ad  where it s most visible to viewers  That s a good way to deliver your most important ad message at first sight of your ad   For example  LinkedIn s ad headline reads   Reach 433m  professionals with LinkedIn Sponsored Content    It states the benefit  explains how the product works  and differentiates LinkedIn from other PPC channels by mentioning the 433m  professionals using the platform       12  Stuffing Ads with Too Much Text  When it comes to Facebook ads  less is often more   When explaining how to improve landing page UX   Peep from ConversionXL explained    The more visual inputs and action options your visitors has to process  the less likely they are to make a conversion decision    Most of the time  the same rule applies to Facebook ads as well  Having fewer distractions in your ad copy might help get more people to convert   When analyzing the perfect length of Facebook posts  Track Social discovered that brief Facebook posts saw the highest engagement       Another study byanalyzed 11 000 Facebook pages and found that engagement increased as posts got shorter   On average  page posts are 157 7 characters  while user posts are 121 5 characters and mobile posts are 104 9 characters  Posts between 140 and 159 characters long are  on average  13 3  less engaging than posts between 120 and 139 characters       Why do shorter Facebook posts work better  One of the reasons might be that they re more concise and deliver the key message more quickly   This Facebook ad example by Target is minimalistic regarding both the ad image and copywriting  People could potentially like this ad more as it doesn t require a big effort to read       However  if you re creating a blog article promotion campaign  having a longer introductory ad copy might make more sense   Here s an example by Clanbeat   sharing one of their blog articles  The longer ad text helps to catch the reader s attention and spark curiosity  so that they might be more interested in reading more       13  Forgetting to Caption Video Ads  When creating your first Facebook Video Ads campaign  you might forget this single important fac t  all the videos in the newsfeed are soundless by default   According to Facebook   captioned video ads increase video view time by an average of 12   In another study of Facebook video ads   41  of videos were basically meaningless without sound   Moreover  Facebook s research shows that    In mobile feed environments  people prefer having the choice to opt in to sound  When feed based mobile video ads play loudly when people aren t expecting it  80  react negatively  both toward the platform and the advertiser        As you forget to caption your video ads  chances are that people won t click on the  Play  button and watch the entire thing  That s because they won t be able to see what your ad is about  only a video without sound or text   You might also want to avoid these video ad mistakes that   according Social Media Examiner   result in low video engagement   Including an intro Using logos or credits at the beginning of video Trying to tell too much in a single video Having a person talking to the camera without sufficient context    As making a video can take multiple hours  or days   it s a smart idea to think it through before getting to work     14  Bad Choice of Ad Placement  In a Facebook experiment   marketers at Scoro discovered that Desktop ads had a 534  higher cost per click than ads placed on Mobile   Audience Network   However  they also discovered that Desktop ads performed a lot better in terms of conversions       The choice of ad placement plays an important role in your Facebook ad results   Facebook s ad placements include   Facebook feeds  mobile and desktop   Facebook right hand column  Instagram  Audience Network  Instant Articles  In stream Video    One of the main reasons why you might make a mistake when choosing your ad placements is the offer and placement mismatch   For example  if you d like people to create a free trial for your business software  Instagram ads might not be the best option as people aren t in the mood of dealing with business when browsing images by their friends   The best way to find out which ad placements result in the highest return on investment  test multiple ad placements and analyze the results   In the Facebook Ads Manager  you can break down Facebook Ads reports by ad placement and see which ones had the lowest cost per click and a high conversion rate       Brand awareness  Facebook and Instagram  Facebook and Instagram Engagement  Facebook and Instagram  Facebook and Instagram Video views  Facebook  Instagram and Audience Network  Facebook  Instagram and Audience Network App installs  Facebook  Instagram and Audience Network  Facebook  Instagram and Audience Network Traffic  for website clicks and app engagement   Facebook and Audience Network  Facebook and Audience Network Product catalog sales  Facebook and Audience Network  Facebook and Audience Network Conversions  Facebook and Audience Network  If you re unsure which ad placements to start with  here s what  15  The 24 7 Ad Delivery  Is your Facebook offer relevant to your target audience 24 7  even at night and on weekends  If so  having your ads run on a regular schedule makes sense   However  there are several arguments against running your ads on full schedule   According to AdEspresso   people will get tired of seeing your ad more quickly     people will get tired of seeing your ad more quickly  You re spending parts of the budget on low traffic hours with fewer conversions     To avoid Facebook ad fatigue and keep your ad frequency under control  set up a custom schedule and deliver your ads only on specific times of week       16  Amateur Ad Bidding  If you re worried about Facebook delivering your ads to the same person too many times per day  you can use the frequency capping a la Facebook  Daily Unique Reach   Facebook operates on an auction type bidding system  just like Google AdWords   PPC bidding is like a science that could potentially give your ad campaigns a real bump when applied skillfully   To customize and view your bidding options in Facebook Ads Manager  go to the  Budget and Schedule  section       Conversions   Facebook will do its best to deliver your ads to people who are most likely to convert  This bidding method is a good place to start as Facebook will optimize the ads for you   Link Clicks   Facebook focuses on getting users to click on your ad to follow the link  If your goal is to get a lot of users to your landing page  or to view an on Facebook page  this could be a good option   Impressions   Facebook optimizes your ads with the goal of being seen by as many people as possible  This is a good option for businesses looking to build brand awareness or sharing highly engaging content  e g  blog articles    Daily Unique Reach   Facebook optimizes for showing your ads to people up to once a day  This method is great for retargeting  ensuring that people will see your ads only once every day and may not get annoyed as quickly   According to AdEspresso   there are three factors that contribute to your ad cost  your bid  ad relevancy  and estimated action rates calculated by Facebook s algorithms   There is no 100  right or wrong bidding method for any ad type   you can find the best ad bidding methods through trial and error   To get some insight into Facebook ad costs by ad placement  have a look at this chart by AdEspresso       17  Slow Campaign Take Off  Sometimes  Facebook ad campaign timelines look like this       Sorry  my bad  What I actually meant was this   For almost two weeks  this campaign failed to start delivering results   Every time your Facebook campaign fails to take off  it might be due to one of these five reasons   You ve created too many ad groups of A B test variations with low budgets  You ad images fail to catch people s attention  Low relevance of ads  might indicate a bad audience targeting   Using the wrong bidding options  Being impatient and making rapid changes    So  what s the cure   Scoro s digital marketing manager Karola Karlson introduced a secret formula on AdEspresso blog called FTO   Fast Take Off   Here s how the FTO method works  Assign Lifetime budgets that cross your planned budget  When starting a new campaign  you ll need about 10 000 impressions to evaluate which ads work and which don t  So  you want Facebook to use more resources at the beginning of the campaign  For example  use a  2 000 budget instead of the planned  400  just to get things rolling   According to Karola  here s why it might just work    Facebook rarely uses the total daily budget  Unless your ads are super relevant to your target audience  Facebook shows the ads less often than you d like  To serve your ads to more people at the beginning of the campaign  increase your initial budget and expand the audience size for a week      18  Leaving Facebook No Time for Optimization  Another freshman Facebook ad mistake is relying too much on instant gratification  expecting a new Facebook campaign to deliver amazing results in the first few hours   After you ve waited for 3 hours without any sight of results  it s easy to write the campaign off as a failure  However  you should give Facebook at least 24 hours to optimize your campaigns  even better if you re able to wait for 48h before making any changes   According to Facebook    It takes our ad delivery system 24 hours to adjust the performance level for your ad  It can take longer when you edit your ad frequently  To fix it  let your ad run for at least 24 hours before you edit it again     Every time you make substantial changes to your campaigns  consider waiting for at least 24 48 hours before drawing any conclusions   Take a look at a campaign results graph below  The campaign was set live on February 12  and it took Facebook almost 48 hours to gather data and start delivering ads on full steam       19  Guessing  Not Testing  What do you think  which one of these ads by Shopify works best       While we don t have access to Shopify s Ads Manager to uncover the test results  we can guess that Shopify was running an A B test to discover the best performing ad image   Had they settled with a single image  Shopify would ve never known if it really was the best option   A study of 37 259 Facebook ads found that  most companies only have 1 ad  but the best had 100 s    SaaS startup Scoro went as far as to test over ten different ad images when starting with Facebook advertising       Whenever you re unsure which target audience  ad copy or ad image to use  experiment with both     20  Doing the Wrong Kind of A B Tests  Not all your split testing ideas are gold   and with limited ad budgets  your A B testing capacity is restricted to a few tests per month   As Pauline Marol  the site optimization lead product manager at Hotwire put it     If you come to me with an idea and it s not live in two weeks  it s not because it s a bad idea it s because I have better things to test    I ve written about simple A B test prioritization methods in a blog post here on KlientBoost s blog   As I explained then  it makes sense to start closest to where your money is   Optimizely put together an absolutely incredible chart to help non seasoned  and seasoned  A B testers to prioritize like a pro       You should also check out the PXL prioritization framework developed by the folks at  AdEspresso studied data from over  3 millions in Facebook Ads experiments and listed A B test elements that provided the biggest gains   Countries Precise interests Mobile OS Age ranges Genders Ad images Titles Relationship status Landing page Interested in    As you can see  many of these elements are related to your target audience  reminding once again how super important it is to figure out whom it is you re targeting     21  Testing Too Many Things at Once  It s easy to get carried away with all those amazing A B testing ideas  However  your Facebook split testing campaign might soon look like this       Asfromcommented on   Many folks will take their research from step one  gather their interests and then lump them all into one big list on the Facebook Ads Manager in hopes of reaching a large target audience  This is a grave mistake that will cost you far more in ad spend  And while you might get results  you ll have no idea which interest brought the best results   Putting all your eggs in one basket isn t the smartest way to do Facebook A B testing   With every experiment you run  you ll need to ensure that you have enough data for your results to be statistically significant and valid    Just like with website testing   you should aim to collect at least 500 conversions before making any conclusions  If you re testing more than two variations  you ll need even more ad impressions and conversions to determine the winning option     22  Low Landing Page and Facebook Ad Match  Imagine you clicked on this ad by Fiverr promoting videos  and were lead to a landing page offering custom logos instead   That would be quite confusing  right       Luckily  Fiverr s landing page presents the same product as their ad Unfortunately  there are also many Facebook ads that lead to the company s home page or irrelevant landing pages   Promising one thing in your Facebook ads and then failing to keep the message consistent throughout your sales funnel could be a costly mistake  A person who s interested in a specific product and fails to find it on your landing page might be inclined to leave the page   To keep your Facebook ad s and landing page s value propositions aligned  use the same messaging throughout your sales funnel   Avoid targeting everyone at once  Instead  address niche audiences with highly targeted ad campaigns like FreshBooks        23  Poor Landing Page UX  Even if you have rockstar Facebook ads that people can t help but click  you may still lose all the conversions due to silly landing page mistakes    In

latest reports   Facebook earns nearly 80  of its revenue from mobile advertising  It s increasingly important to keep your mobile landing page UX top notch       24  Neglecting the Conversion Tracking  While it s tempting to neglect the conversion tracking and get your Facebook campaigns up and running ASAP  it s not sustainable in the long term   Without proper conversion tracking  you ll have no way of analyzing your ad results   While you can see your ad s click through rate and many other ad metrics without any tracking adjustments  there are no means to track off site conversions   Facebook tracks off platform conversions via Facebook Pixel that you need to install to your website   To set up the basic Facebook Pixel code  follow these guidelines   Go to the Pixels Page in Ads Manager Click Actions   View Code    Each ad account gets only one Pixel code  Use the Pixel code on every page of your website  or websites        3  Copy the code and paste it between the tags on

make you feel like you ve just won an Oscar for your phenomenal work       When you log in to the Facebook Ads Manager  you ll get a chance to binge on vanity metrics  impressions  click through rate  cost per click   None of these metrics matters if they fail to contribute to your ultimate goal   sales   On the first look   which one of these ad keywords is performing better       26  Leaving Ads Unattended  But what if you take into account the click to conversion to sales rates  The story takes an unexpected turn Always  and I mean ALWAYS   focus on your end goal when analyzing Facebook campaign results   Ads are like pets  Once you leave them on their own  they get naughty and start making trouble       learned this lesson the hard way  They set up well performing ad campaigns and left them running for several months In five months  the average cost per conversion for the campaign raised over 1050  from  3 33 to  38 47   Here s what AdEspresso s CEO Massimo Chieruzzi had to say    Our cost per conversion had increased ten times in just a few months  While  through split testing  I had found a great design and an audience that loved our product  it was a very small audience  Throwing a lot of money at this small audience  we soon saturated it after only two months  wasting a load of money in the process   To keep your Facebook ad campaigns under control  conduct weekly checkups  It might be worth reviewing your ad campaigns even more often after the initial setup   AdEspresso suggests that you keep track of these eight Facebook ad metrics   Ad frequency Relevance score Click through rate vs  conversion rate Number of leads Facebook Ads customer churn Ad performance by placement Clicks by interests Ad engagement rate  27  Neglecting the Ad Frequency  Ad frequency is a Facebook ad metric that shows how many times people have seen your ad on average   As you might have guessed  the higher your ad frequency  the greater the likelihood that people are tired and bored of seeing the same ad over and over again   AdEspresso analyzed how ad frequency affects the click through rate  cost per click  and cost per conversion of ad campaigns  Here are their findings       When people saw the same ads twice  the click through rate decreased by 8 91   But when shown repetitive ads for 5 times  the cost per click was already 98 51  higher compared to the first ad delivery   The general rule is to keep your ad frequency between 3 5 points   However  there are exceptions  For example  some Facebook remarketing campaigns have shown good results even while the ad frequency was well over ten ad views   Here s a results chart of a Facebook remarketing campaign run by SaaS startup Scoro       As you can see  the cost per click only increased at the very end of the campaign  when the ad frequency reached 15 points       28  Not Using Auto Optimization  Don t make the mistake of neglecting high ad frequency   use it as an indicator that your campaigns might need an update  but also check for other metrics to confirm the fact    If you re afraid of high ad frequency and diminishing campaign results  spending hours on checking your Facebook ad reports  there s a way to escape this burden   It s called Facebook Automated Rules   Automated rules help to keep your Facebook ad campaigns under control and have four things happen automatically if the rule conditions are satisfied   Turn off  campaign  ad set or ad   Send notification to the ad manager  you   Adjust budget  increase decrease daily lifetime budget by    Adjust manual bid

After you ve selected the campaigns or ads  you can create custom combinations of conditions that will trigger an action   For example  you can ask Facebook to automatically turn off all active ads in the campaign with ad frequency greater than 4       29  Missing Out on the Conclusions  Automated Rules can go to great lengths on notifying you when a campaign starts to get lower results and helping you to keep ad costs under control   Some marketers run tens of Facebook campaigns  but make the same mistakes time and time again   This could be avoided by keeping a diary   No  not the fluffy pink soft covered princess  diary  although this could work as well   but a general spreadsheet where you note down all the key takeaways from each Facebook campaign   Before you send an old Facebook

1380,training-dataset/business/1325.txt,business,The killer feature of messaging no one s talking aboutMessaging looks set to disrupt the computing landscape but not for any of the reasons you might expect  Chat s threaded UI  where all communication and actions are placed in a clear context of who  what and why  is the killer feature that s been around forever and yet everyone is overlooking  Mobile is the future of global computing  and according to Mary Meeker and Co   the killer app for mobile continues to be messaging  a k a  Conversational UI among pedantic product designers like me   In 2015  messengers surpassed social networks in both number of users and rate of growth  And even though the mobile OS plus app thing is still strong  research consistently shows that users interact with just 27 unique apps per month  and actually care about far fewer over time  To find fresh  lightweight ways to reach users  forward thinking businesses are turning to chat  and of course Intercom helps companies do this    Chatbots have been anointed by industry leaders like Zuckerberg and Satya as the way to launch and scale this effort  and it s all really real  according to Gartner  via Techcrunch   They predict by 2018 a full 30 percent of our technology interactions will be mediated through conversations with bots  New threaded experiences will be enabled  supplanting single purpose apps  sites  and services   even on the desktop But chat UI will not blow up just because of bots or other emerging UI bits and pieces  As messengers evolve into full blown computing platforms  new threaded experiences will be enabled  supplanting single purpose apps  sites  and services even on the desktop  It s the threaded organisation of interactions into useful contexts centered around people  businesses and task threads that could change the world  Chat UI as a platform On top of the twin forces of app ennui and bot ification  there s a third force at work that s gaining momentum and it s the one that could really transform chat into a general purpose platform  It s the tighter and tighter integration of third party services  notably payments  into threads  The Chinese chat leader  WeChat  has a general purpose wallet and interpersonal micro transfer platform that s huge in the Chinese market  Reuters reported that in 2016  WeChat s estimated transaction volume on personal transfers alone  excluding wallet transactions like movies  meals and wheels  will be almost double PayPal s  280bn 2015 volume  and all without the aid of single bot  While it s true that uniquely Chinese factors steroid ed this growth  a distrust for online card payments  a trust of mobile operators  and a giant population  western messengers such as Snapchat and Facebook M also have integrated payments  and rumors abound that Apple Messenger and Telegram will soon follow suit  Messenger payments are definitely coming and where payments go  so goes general commerce  If you zoom out a bit and look at the broad messenger picture  then  what you see is a class of service that s  mobile first has device based user verification built in has social recommendations on tap and supports deeply integrated  inline  third party services  As a total package  that s a pretty compelling mix  and much more than browser apps can bring to the table  Smart threading is the X Factor    As more and more services get more deeply embedded into the chat experience  messengers will likely deploy a range of UIs to support them  I may want to ask my bank chatbot to send me a copy of my monthly statement as a text message  but I ll buy a pizza by selecting a visual menu page  and perhaps hail an Uber using a combination of a bot and a threaded button  Facebook M style  Despite all of the discussion on chat bots  I m convinced the chat thread will evolve to encompass a wide range of interactions with a range of UIs to enable them  Chats will be hybrid of human and bot chat  sprinkled with full screen GUIs as well as decomposed  chattable  min terface  bits like threaded text buttons  graphical UI elements in soft keyboards  and nicely displayed placards of information  As more and more services get more deeply embedded into the chat experience  messengers will likely deploy a range of UIs to support them  I may want to ask my bank chatbot to send me a copy of my

sprinkled with full screen GUIs as well as decomposed  chattable  min terface  bits like threaded text buttons  graphical UI elements in soft keyboards  and nicely displayed placards of information  What will drive all of this is not just the arrival of bots  but the fact that threads are simply a better paradigm for organising your digital life than anything cobbled together from email  web pages  apps and the odd SMS  They re great at keeping context  simply scroll up if you forget what you re talking about   so they can help people shift quickly from one stream of communication to another without the soul destroying digging around we are forced to do today  And they re perfect for organising everything around what s actually important  the thing you re trying to do or the person with whom you want to communicate  Let s look at a couple of examples of how this could work  Removing friction from regular purchases It s lunchtime  I m hungry  and in my messenger of choice  I search for McDonald s  In my  future  address book s location aware  and smarter  business directory tab  I pick McDonald s  and start a chat with the restaurant by texting or speaking  Hey   poking them with my poke button  or ringing a branded minterface McDonald s hamburger shaped doorbell  This conversation starter creates implied consent  so I m happy for McDonald s to determine which store I m near  take a good long look at my AI enriched profile to see how I like to pay  and whether or not I want to get a calorie total of the meal or not before paying  ha  ha   McDonald s can easily see my past orders  organised into the McDonald s thread  and using this information  deliver a custom soft keyboard picture menu sporting its latest healthy snack and today s elderflower cordial shake   As I select items  my order is assembled into a tidy chat bubble that I can review  edit and add new things to  using standard chat interface interactions until I m happy  Then I just hit  send  to place the order  The order is received  paid for with a minterface payment button that appears inline  and it s ready for pickup by the time I arrive  Rich profiling and relevant browsing Let s say I want to buy a new jacket  and from past web browsing or brick and mortar shopping experiences  I think UNIQLO s the brand for me  I search for UNIQLO in my business directory  and text them to say  I want a lightweight jacket for delivery to my home  please   I ve given implied consent to share AI enriched profile information with UNIQLO  so they get information about my size  gender  and my delivery area,"[1380 342 1181 217 252 623 1196 1166 501 411 947]"

Download your FREE eBook now to get more Facebook ad templates and tons of design tips and insights     GET YOUR FREE EBOOK    Are Facebook ads something you have wanted to try for a while  but you haven t been sure where to start   It can be a bit daunting   Especially if you have to design your Facebook images yourself   A good place to start is to identify the goal of your Facebook ads   The ultimate goal of any Facebook ad is to catch someone s eye with the right combination of stunning visuals and compelling copy  And then to get them to click through to your site   You want the ad to stand out against the background noise of news  politics and status updates   The ad copy could be impeccable but the visual has to be even better  since that s what will be seen first  Now that almost every news site  company page or blogger uses compelling visuals  standing out has become more difficult   That s why our team worked hard to come up with these actionable tips for creating the most effective Facebook images for 2017   By now there are thousands  or maybe millions  of guides on how to create the perfect visual for a Facebook Ad   The problem   Those tips and tricks is are either extremely broad or would only work for a specific product or niche  And worst of all  they are not immediately actionable  or they require a professional design team  which not everyone can afford   Instead of being one of those incredibly broad guides that tells you what you already know  we decided to test very specific things   So we tested 35 different Facebook ads over a few weeks to find out what visual elements drove the most clicks   Here is what we found   What Facebook Images We Tested  We were interested in finding out what the best visual components were for a Facebook ad  The budget  audience  and time were kept exactly the same to limit the variables and hopefully make our test even more accurate   So we decided to run Facebook ads for our Ultimate Guide To Designing Epic Social Media Images   The ad copy was also kept consistent throughout  with the ads looking exactly the same as the example below   From there  we decided to try 26 different design combinations to help narrow down the Facebook images for the next round of testing   Some of the design elements we tested were quite different  like whether or not light or dark colors lead to more clicks   But others were a little more subtle  like whether or not a combination of serif and sans serif fonts help bring in more clicks   Here are a few of the ads that we tested   As you can see  we tested different font families  sizes and positions   Here is a breakdown of the different design combinations we tested   Color   Vibrant Pa stel Neutral Dark     4 Ads  Font   Serif Sans Serif Caps Sentence Case     4 Ads  Text   Large Small Centered Left Right Top Bottom None    8 Ads  Illustrations   Illustrated Control     2 Ads  Image   Person Animal Food Universal Product Location     6 Ads  Chart Data Viz   Chart Graph     2 Ads  Call To Action   2 Ads  Branding   2 Ads  Memes  2 Ads  Fraction Of Image   1 Ad  Before After   1 Ad  If you would like a deeper explanation about each of the ads and how we created them  do not hesitate to leave a comment   First Test Run  So what did we find   There are seven design elements and combinations that performed better than the rest   Based on those results  we created a sample of new ads and tested them to see which were the ultimate Facebook ad design combinations   1  Use Recognizable Images  First  we found that people love relevant memes  or at least love Facebook images that they are familiar with   The most popular ad we created involved none other than the queen of daytime TV  Oprah   I mean  no surprises there   For the people who love seeing numbers  this ad received 145  more clicks when compared to the sample average   Not bad  Oprah     Start this Facebook Ad now     Memes like this one are great for Facebook ads because the average internet user has some familiarity with them already  This gives your ad an advantage because the idea you are trying to convey is understood immediately   Now  I am not saying that you need to be hip to the most popular memes to create successful Facebook ads  but it s worth a try   2  Try a Dark Color Scheme  The second best performing ad utilized a dark color scheme   This ad received a total of 131  more clicks than the sample average and was our second most popular ad   To be honest  I suspected that this would be one of our best performers for reasons I will explain below   But first  take a look at the ad   Create this Facebook Ad now   As you can see  the darker colors stand out well against Facebook s light grey and white background  The white text is also very easy to read against the black background   In this ad  we also tested the position of the text  which  as you can see  was left aligned  We found that it performed significantly better than ads which had text that was right aligned or even centered   Why is that   I suspect it s because people are used to scanning through headlines on Facebook and pretty much everywhere else where text is you guessed it left aligned   3  Use Charts   Graphs  The third most popular ad design included something that we are very familiar with at Venngage  a graph   This was another ad that I knew would be a winner from the beginning  And it was  with 86  more clicks than the average for the sample   And  as you can see  the text is left aligned in this one as well     Create this Facebook Ad now   A graph like this can be digested very quickly and also presents the idea that this ebook will help your social media metrics grow is distilled   This is pertinent when people are consuming massive amounts of information on any social media platform   Now  let s take a look at the other design elements that made this a winner   First  the contrasting colors of the graph really made the image pop on a blue background   Next  the title or text is the only thing that is white in the ad  which makes it stand out   And finally  the magic wand pushes your eye directly to the title of the ad   Basically   We kept it simple and used subtle design tricks to make it an effective ad   This was in contrast with another chart ad that we used  which probably confused more than informed   Not to mention  the text ended up being difficult to read on the busy background  which probably lent to this ad s less than stellar results   Second Test Run  After running our first batch of tests  we picked elements from the best ads and combined them into a few mega ads   There were a few surprises   Here are the top three performing ads from our second test run   1  Use Thematic Images   Product Shots  Instead of showing someone creating a social media image  the top performing ad from our second test utilized a more metaphorical image of a beautiful night sky   The success of this ad was somewhat surprising since it didn t directly have to do with social media   Create this Facebook Ad now   But after I looked a little deeper into the image  it made sense why it performed so well   First  the image utilizes dark tones to make it stand out against the white background of Facebook  But the main image is also able to use a vivid palette with contrasting colors to give it a great balance   Next  we included the actual ebook cover in the image  which shows to the audience that it is a tangible product  In this format  it looks like a formidable guide full of interesting ideas instead of just a blog post   Plus  just like with the magic wand from an earlier ad  the book draws your eye to the title   And finally the use of a white title made it pop on such a dark background   2  Use A Dark Color Scheme and a CTA  Our second most successful ad from the second test used a similar dark color scheme to the second ad from the first test   This ad used a solid black background with white left aligned  which we already know is a winner     Create a Facebook Ad now   Unlike the original dark ad  this one included a few extra design elements that we saw performed well in other ads   For example  you can clearly see the large red call to action button in the upper right corner  This was added to not only catch the eye  but also push our audience in the correct direction   How so   In the other ads it only said  Download Now  but the little extra instruction in  Click to Download  pushes our audience actually click   I believe that this also informed people that they could get this product not only for free  but immediately as well   People love free things that also provide immediate gratification   And  again  we included a picture of the product  which helps people visualize a product that is virtual   3  Use Icons and Charts  Like we have already discovered  popular topics like food  memes or locations work really well   In the third most popular ad from the second test  we used coffee as our popular topic and built the visual around it   This was also only one of a few ads from the whole study that used icons or graphics in the visual   Aside from grabbing our audience s attention  they were also used to give the visual more context in this case  that this guide would help your social media and marketing metrics skyrocket   The style of the icons also helped the ad succeed  Fun and whimsical icons can help put your audience at ease  appeals to the child in all of us  and makes the product seem more accessible   So ditch the boring minimalistic icons and using something more fun   In Summary  From both rounds of testing  we were able to glean to eight key tips to take away   Left align text  Use recognizable images and memes  Include a product shot  Include a call to action  Use fun and playful icons  Use white text  Mix up font styles and sizes  Use interesting and thematic images   These are little things that you can add to your next campaign  To help you get started  we created a bunch of customizable Facebook image templates which you can see here,"[1383 1375 435 951 252 1074 501 146 926 947 1196]"
